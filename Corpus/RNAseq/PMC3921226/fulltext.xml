In what ways do these functionally enigmatic genes differ from well-studied genes? To address these two questions, we devised a computational approach that defines so-called <italic>ignoromes</italic>. As proof of principle, we extracted and analyzed a large subset of genes with intense and selective expression in brain. We find that publications associated with this set are highly skewed&#x02014;the top 5% of genes absorb 70% of the relevant literature. In contrast, approximately 20% of genes have essentially no neuroscience literature. Analysis of the ignorome over the past decade demonstrates that it is stubbornly persistent, and the rapid expansion of the neuroscience literature has not had the expected effect on numbers of these genes. Surprisingly, ignorome genes do not differ from well-studied genes in terms of connectivity in coexpression networks. Nor do they differ with respect to numbers of orthologs, paralogs, or protein domains. The major distinguishing characteristic between these sets of genes is date of discovery, early discovery being associated with greater research momentum&#x02014;a genomic bandwagon effect. Finally we ask to what extent massive genomic, imaging, and phenotype data sets can be used to provide high-throughput functional annotation for an entire ignorome. In a majority of cases we have been able to extract and add significant information for these neglected genes. In several cases&#x02014;<italic>ELMOD1, TMEM88B</italic>, and <italic>DZANK1</italic>&#x02014;we have exploited sequence polymorphisms, large phenome data sets, and reverse genetic methods to evaluate the function of ignorome genes.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Integrative Neuroscience Initiative on Alcoholism grants U01AA016662, U01AA13499, U24AA13513, U01AA014425 (RWW), University of Memphis Bioinformatics Program and the Assisi Foundation of Memphis (RH).

The distribution follows a power law <xref rid="pone.0088889-Su1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, probably because researchers tend to work collaboratively and collectively on genes they perceive to be important <xref rid="pone.0088889-Pfeiffer1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Pfeiffer and Hoffmann highlight the social bias that can produce this type of bandwagon effect, but they also point to the opposite tendency to explore the unknown. The disappointing fact is that after two decades of intense and sophisticated molecular and genetic analyses, more than a third of all protein-coding genes have almost no literature or known function. We refer to this subset of the genome as an ignorome. If &#x0201c;real knowledge is to know the extent of one's ignorance&#x0201d; (paraphrasing Confucius, analects 2&#x02236;17), then we currently need to determine the extent of the ignorome and whether it arises from social patterns of research or unusual biological properties.</p><p>An ignorome can be computed at the level of an entire genome, but as we show here, an ignorome can also be computed at the level of a single organ, tissue, or cell type using patterns and levels of expression as a metric of functional importance. These more refined ignoromes are particularly useful when the goal is to define gene or protein function. In the present study we focus on the mammalian CNS&#x02014;mainly of mouse and human. We have computed ignorome scores that are a function of (1) gene expression in the brain, (2) selectivity of expression in brain versus other organs, and (3) the size of the neuroscience literature. Two steps are essential to define an ignorome using this quantitative approach: accurate assignment of expression data to the correct gene, and precise estimation of the neuroscience literature coverage for each gene. For the first step we used deep RNA-seq data that we recently generated for whole brain <xref rid="pone.0088889-Chesler1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0088889-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> to correctly assign genes in large expression data sets. For the second step, we used a generalizable data mining approach that minimizes irrelevant and false literature linkages created by ambiguous gene names. Using these methods we have been able to extract the most interesting fraction of the ignorome that has both <italic>i</italic>ntense and highly <italic>s</italic>elective <italic>e</italic>xpression (ISE) in the brain. These genes are likely to have greater impact on brain function and behavior, and can be more readily evaluated using genetic, genomic, and phenotypic resources.</p><p>Remarkably, we find that the ignorome does not differ from well-studied genes in terms of connectivity in coexpression networks. Numbers of orthologs, paralogs, or protein domains do not differ greatly between the two types of genes. This strongly supports the idea that the neglected subset of the genome is more of a matter of the sociology of science that of inherent differences in biology. Supporting this hypothesis we find that well-studied genes have much earlier discovery dates by an average of 10 years.</p><p>We used multiple genomic resources and a variety of approaches to provide a useful functional context for a significant majority of brain ignorome genes including: gene coexpression analysis, protein domain comparison, analysis of in situ expression in many CNS cell types, and a novel genetic method referred to as reverse complex trait analysis <xref rid="pone.0088889-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0088889-Overall1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. We close by giving several specific and intriguing examples of ignorome genes likely to be of importance in CNS function. The methods we have developed here can be applied widely to prioritize genes for detailed functional analysis in many different tissues, cells, and systems.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Genes with intense and selective expression in the brain</title><p>To extract the list of genes with intense and selective expression we compared patterns of gene expression in the brain with those in more than 20 other organs and tissue types using both Illumina MouseWG-6 v2 and Affymetrix M430 2.0 arrays. We selected all assays of mRNA expression&#x02014;probes and probe sets&#x02014;that had at least eight-fold higher expression in brain compared to other tissues (Methods). We identified 493 and 615 probes and probe sets with intense and selective expression (ISE) in brain, respectively. While we have mostly exploited murine data sets, in the text below, we have used human gene symbols whenever possible.</p><sec id="s2a1"><title>Annotation of intense and selectively expressed genes</title><p>Many probes that target specific transcripts in the brain are still poorly annotated, and as a result probes that actually target well-studied genes can be incorrectly nominated as part of an ignorome. We used deep RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) for whole brain (&#x0223c;1 billion strand-specific tags from 34 strains of mice, see Methods) to reevaluate the annotation for a small subset of ambiguous probes and their associated transcripts (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;28, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0088889.s002">Table S1</xref>). For example, Affymetrix probe set <italic>1457743_at</italic> was not assigned to any gene in the original annotation file, but actually maps to the distal 3&#x02032; UTR of <italic>RGS7BP</italic>.

Not surprisingly, this set of 650 genes contains intensively studied genes known to be involved in brain function and development. With the exception of <italic>Zfp941</italic>, all 650 have unequivocal human orthologs and also have supporting identifiers in different databases including Refseq, MGI, and Ensemble. More than 98% are conserved across five or more species. A few genes, such as <italic>CMTM5</italic> and <italic>PRR18</italic>, appear to be restricted to mammals. Many others, such as <italic>SGTB</italic> and <italic>RNFT2</italic>, are conserved in more than 10 species (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;170 genes). We have used the union of the two ISE sets as starting material to define a brain ignorome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Neuroscience-specific literature coverage</title><p>The number of publications for these 650 ISE genes is highly skewed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088889-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

Hoffman and Valencia <xref rid="pone.0088889-Hoffmann1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> showed no correlation between a gene's impact in the scientific literature and it's centrality in protein-protein interactions, a finding that certainly is concordant with our main results.

It is possible that the well-studied genes have still undiscovered characteristics that justify the extra affection that they continue to receive. Interestingly, we did not find any prominent differences between well studied and ignorome sets at any level of analysis, including expression selectivity, co-expression connectivity, and species conservation (paralog and ortholog abundance).

Ignoromes can also be calculated for different states such as a disease or response to a drug treatment. The only restriction in computing different types of ignoromes is that the literature pertaining to the relevant area of research must be sufficiently large. Large literature size will ensure a relatively smooth distribution of scores and adequate resolution and ranking of genes. For example, pancreatic beta cells (&#x0223c;20,000 papers) and astrocytes (&#x0223c;36,000 papers) have enormous literatures and ignoromes could be easily computed given the literature and numerous &#x02018;omics&#x02019; data sets, even at the cellular level. In every case, careful manual curation will be essential to avoid errors introduced by ambiguous nomenclature or incorrect gene models. The methods and code that we provide in the Methods section should provide a start to systematically define what the blind spots in genome functional annotation.</p><p>Assuming that the literature distribution of ISE genes for any tissue follows a power law, the size of the ignorome will depend on number of genes that show intense and selective expression. For the expression data set that we used in our study <xref rid="pone.0088889-Thorrez1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, four other common tissues&#x02014;testis, placenta, embryonic stem cells, and heart&#x02014;also have comparatively large numbers of ISE genes. In contrast, tissues with modest cellular diversity or widely shared functions will often have smaller numbers of ISE genes and may also have smaller ignoromes. However, since the ignorome is also a function of literature coverage, there will be important exceptions and tissues with small numbers of ISE genes may have large ignoromes.</p><p>Depending on the goal of a study or system of interest, different quantitative metrics can be used to evaluate the &#x02018;genetic&#x02019; or biological importance of genes. Expression selectivity, sequence conservation or centrality in protein networks are some characteristics that can be used to rank potential biological importance. Whole transcriptome data sets have advantages. The first of these is comprehensiveness&#x02014;the availability of expression data for nearly all protein-coding genes. In contrast, mammalian protein interactomes are still incomplete and many proteins lack interaction data. The second, almost paradoxical advantage of expression data is the lack of association between a gene's expression selectivity score and its literature coverage. Expression selectivity scores are computed without reference to the literature. In contrast, specific protein&#x02013;protein interactions are frequently reported in the literature. As a result, proteins with high numbers of interacting partners will obviously have high literature counts. For expression data, the literature is only minimally &#x0201c;contaminated&#x0201d; by large &#x02018;omics&#x02019; studies and literature contaminants are easily removed.</p><p>Using tissue-selectivity scores as a metric overlooks genes that have widespread expression but that have highly specific function.

Broadening inclusion criteria to include genes with as many as five articles could be easily justified and would expand the brain ignorome to &#x0223c;200 genes&#x02014;almost one-third of the ISE brain set. In this study we have also applied a very high expression selectively criterion&#x02014;8-fold higher expression in brain than in other tissue. This criterion could easily be relaxed to 4-fold, and the size of the brain ignorome would double. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0088889-g001">Figure 1</xref>, half of all brain ISE genes absorb only 1% of the neuroscience literature and from this vantage point could easily be defined as below the poverty line.

The final list used for computing a generic brain ignorome is therefore selective rather than exclusive.</p><p>When two or more probe identifiers mapped to the same gene identifiers, we retained one with the highest brain selectivity. We excluded probe sets that (1) mapped to multiple locations (2) belong to a non-protein-coding gene. We also removed probe sets containing SNPs and small indels between B6 and D2 to avoid false expression estimates caused by hybridization artifacts <xref rid="pone.0088889-Ciobanu1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>.</p><p>We converted brain selectivity scores into relative brain selectivity scores by dividing them with the highest brain selectivity score for that array. The resulting relative scores for both arrays ranged between 0 and 1 and were merged together to form a single data set. In case where the gene was common to both arrays, the highest relative selectivity score was retained.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Expression analysis using RNA-seq</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from the whole brains of adult mice using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test Inc) as described in Li, Mulligan, and colleague <xref rid="pone.0088889-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. RNA samples with RNA integrity number greater than 8 were used to generate transcriptome libraries, which were sequenced on the SOLiD platform. Short sequence reads were analyzed using Applied Biosystems whole transcriptome software tools. Reads were mapped to the C57BL/6J reference genome (NCBI build 37) with a minimum mapping quality of 25. We were aware of the allelic bias problem in aligning reads of DBA2/J (D2) origin to the B6 reference genome. However, our purpose of using RNA-seq results was to determine exact 3&#x02032; UTR length rather than quantitative expression difference between B6 and D2 transcriptome. Expression estimates were calculated as the reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (RPKM). This metric normalizes a transcript's read count by both its length and the total number of mapped reads in the sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Validation of annotation of ISE brain genes</title><p>Annotations of microarray probes are still surprisingly poor. Most of the probes we have exploited target the 3&#x02032; UTRs of mRNAs, and unfortunately, annotations of 3&#x02032; UTRs of genes with high expression in the brain are especially poor due to their extreme length <xref rid="pone.0088889-Smibert1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. We generated deep RNA-seq data (&#x0003e;1 billion 50 nt oriented tags from rRNA-minus whole brain RNA) to reliably determine the maximal length of 3&#x02032; UTRs of mRNAs in the brain and the full extent of the cognate genes. All of our summed brain RNAseq tag count data are accessible at ucscbrowser.genenetwork.org and whole brain gene expression level expression data (RPKM) for 28 strains of mice are accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genenetwork.org">www.genenetwork.org</ext-link>.
