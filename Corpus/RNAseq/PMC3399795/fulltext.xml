In this work we compared the small RNA profiles in the different genomic compositions interacting in the complex in order to explore the miRNA involvement in gene expression regulation of triploids. Using high-throughput arrays and sequencing technologies we were able to verify that diploid and triploid hybrids shared most of their sequences and their miRNA expression profiles were high correlated. However, an overall view indicates an up-regulation of several miRNAs in triploids and a global miRNA expression in triploids higher than the predicted from an additive model.

This cyprinid fish forms a widely distributed complex endemic to the Iberian Peninsula. It originated by hybridization between a female <italic>Squalius pyrenaicus</italic> (G&#x000fc;nther) (P genome) and an already extinct paternal ancestor related to <italic>Anaecypris hispanica</italic> (Steindachner) (A genome) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-Alves1">[1]</xref>. Nowadays, in the southern basins, the fish is sympatric with the parental species <italic>S. pyrenaicus</italic> (P genome), which still interacts with the complex as a sperm donor and thus acts as source of genetic material <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-Alves1">[1]</xref>. A characteristic feature of the <italic>S. alburnoides</italic> complex is its high reproductive diversity. This promotes intricately networked genetic exchanges and continuous shifting between different genetic forms. Indeed, several mechanisms of sexual and asexual reproduction have been described in this complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-Alves2">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-CrespoLpez1">[3]</xref> and gamete production is assured by hybridogenesis, meiosis and meiotic hybridogenesis. As a result, the complex is composed of hybrids with different ploidies and genomic constitutions, with the most common forms present in southern rivers being the triploids PAA and the diploids PA and AA. AA is extinct as an independent species but is frequently reconstituted from the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041158-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0041158-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0041158.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Reproductive mechanisms in the interacting forms of the <italic>S. alburnoides</italic> complex.</title><p>A) Gametes production - Gametes are produced clonally (1), by hybridogenesis (2), by meiotic hybridogenesis (3) or by normal meiosis (4).

However, the evolutionary success of this complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-Alves1">[1]</xref> suggests that it may have developed mechanisms that stabilize its genome. These mechanisms are likely to involve gene expression regulation. Indeed, gene silencing was observed in different tissues of PAA allotriploids by studying allelic regulation of selected house-keeping and tissue-specific genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-Pala1">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-Matos1">[6]</xref>.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are involved in a wide range of biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-Bartel1">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-Krol1">[10]</xref>, are candidate regulators for the observed silencing and compensation. Computational analysis showed that each animal miRNA can regulate hundreds of different mRNAs, suggesting that a remarkably large proportion of the transcriptome (about 50&#x00025; in humans) is subjected to miRNA regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-Bartel1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-Voinnet1">[9]</xref>. Involvement of miRNA in hybrid and polyploidy regulation is supported by observations in allopolypoloid plants where genome-wide expression analyses indicate that many genes and miRNAs are expressed non-additively (differently from the mid-parent value) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-Hegarty1">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-Ha1">[14]</xref>.

No major differences of miRNA expression levels were found in any of the possible comparisons, either in the microarrays or in the small RNAseq analysis. Indeed, the majority of fold changes were between 0.5 to 2 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0041158.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>). Therefore, we focused on the moderate expression changes detected in the small RNAseq data, deciding that the lower sensitivity of microarrays and the decreased fidelity of <italic>Danio rerio</italic> miRNA chip could compromise accuracy. For the analysis, normalized counts of each miRNA in one library were divided by the corresponding expression value of the same miRNA in the other library; log ratios were plotted producing a characteristic crescent curve where positive values indicate miRNAs with a higher expression and negative values mRNAs with a lower expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041158-g006"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref>). Results indicated that the increase in the ploidy level affected the miRNA transcriptome, since the analysis between diploids and triploid hybrids showed a significant difference in the number of up and down-expressed miRNAs (&#x003c7;-test, p&#x0003c;0.001), with an higher amount of up-regulated miRNAs in triploids (72&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041158-g006"><bold>Figure 6A</bold></xref>). However, no conclusions about the absolute up-regulation in block of all miRNAs in PAAs can be made, since the same molar amount of small RNA library was used for sequencing. Nevertheless, small RNAseq reveals a change in the global profile of PAAs, with a higher percentage of miRNAs being up-regulated in comparison to any other diploid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041158-g006"><bold>Figure 6A</bold></xref>). In support of this evidence, the majority of up-regulated miRNAs (93&#x00025;) in PAA/PA were also up-regulated in at least one of the other comparisons (PAA/PP or PAA/AA) and 62&#x00025; were up-regulated in all the three comparisons (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0041158.s004">Table S3</xref></bold>). If we considered only the miRNAs that change their expression more than 1 fold, 21&#x00025; are up-regulated in all the comparisons and correspond to 5 miRNAs: dre-mir-182, dre-mir-183, dre-mir-96, dre-mir-141 and dre-mir-192 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0041158.s004">Table S3</xref></bold>).

Indeed, the relative differences in the miRNA expression profiles between hybrids and non-hybrids diploids seem to be related with the differences in the miRNA expression profiles between the non-hybrid forms PP and AA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041158-g006"><bold>Figure 6C</bold></xref>). In agreement with that, 80&#x00025; of the up or down-regulated miRNAs in PA/PP and 72&#x00025; of the up or down-regulated miRNAs in PA/AA changed their expression in a consistent direction with the AA/PP comparison (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0041158.s004">Table S3</xref></bold>), with only 4 miRNAs expressing differently in both comparisons (PA<italic>/</italic>PP and PA/AA) from the expected from the AA/PP tendency. However, these 4 miRNAs (dre-mir-727, dre-mir-27d, dre-mir-27b, dre-mir-142b-5p) show moderate changes, meaning less than 1 fold, in any comparison (PA/PP, PA/AA and PP/AA)(<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0041158.s004">Table S3</xref></bold>).</p><p>The additivity in miRNA expression in the hybrid forms was also investigated. For that, we used the miRNA expression levels of the non-hybrid diploids (AA and PP) to calculate the expected expression. To satisfy the expectation of additivity, PA expression should equal (PP&#x0002b;AA)/2 and PAA should equal (PP&#x0002b;AA&#x0002b;AA)/3). In both cases, the real values of expression do not differ markedly from the expected values (&#x02212;1&#x0003c;log(real/expected)&#x0003c;1 in 89&#x00025; of the miRNAs; <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0041158.s005">Table S4</xref></bold>).

However, this hybridogenetic complex shows high evolutionary success, and so it is an excellent organism to investigate allopolyploidization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-Alves1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-CrespoLpez1">[3]</xref>. The allopolyploid <italic>S. alburnoides</italic> complex must overcome these genetic constrains in order to achieve a functional gene expression. The ability to reach phenotypic homeostasis is demonstrated by comparison of diploids (PA) and triploids (PAA), which are morphologically undistinguishable (PP and AA are easily distinguishable) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-Ribeiro1">[20]</xref>. This suggests that gene expression in PAA is non-additive. The presence in triploid vertebrates of a compensating silencing mechanism was first suggested by Pala <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-Pala1">[4]</xref>. Consistent with this proposal, the increase of A gene dosage in a triploid was compensated since the PAA reduced transcript levels to that of the PA diploid. This phenomenon was shown to be persistent in several river habitats where <italic>S. pyrenaicus</italic> is sympatric with <italic>S. alburnoides</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-Matos1">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Deviation for additivity has been reported for polyploidy plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-Comai1">[21]</xref>. For instance, a study from Guo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-Guo1">[22]</xref> described dosage-dependent (additive) regulation for several maize genes, and dosage compensation for a few genes. Many miRNA and their targets were not additively expressed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> allotetraploids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-Wang1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-Ha1">[14]</xref>, suggesting a miRNA&#x02019;s functional role in gene regulation. MicroRNAs, which are post-transcriptional gene expression modulators play major roles in several biological processes in plants and animals and are prime candidates to alleviate the genetic constrains generated in polyploid organisms. However, while a miRNAs involvement in non additive gene regulation has been reported in allopolyploid plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-Ha2">[23]</xref>, a genome-wide role in dosage compensation has not yet been documented.</p><p>In this study, miRNA expression profiles of the three most frequent forms of <italic>S. alburnoides</italic> (genomic compositions AA, PA and PAA), as well as the parental species <italic>S. pyrenaicus</italic> (PP) were assessed using next generation sequencing and microarrays hybridization. In the first approach, the Illumina platform provided deep coverage of the small RNA transcriptome. About 60&#x00025; of quality-filtered reads could be aligned to the <italic>Danio rerio</italic> genome, confirming the high conservation level between <italic>Squalius pyrenaicus</italic> and <italic>Squalius alburnoides</italic> with the <italic>Danio</italic> reference genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-Pala3">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-Rber1">[19]</xref>. Additionally, the length distribution of the reads indicated predominant representation of 22 nucleotides, the expected size for miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041158-g002"><bold>Figure</bold>
<bold>2</bold></xref>). Although our results do not show similar number of reads with 22 nts for all the libraries, this probably reflects their qualities, since libraries from PP and PAA appeared less concentrated during gel electrophoresis analysis. This can also explain why PP and PAA display more reads in 25&#x02013;30 lengths: since the lower amount of 22 nts reads generates a relative increase in the reads of different size classes. After the genome alignment, sequences were annotated with several databases revealing a set of 204 conserved miRNAs. The miRNAs proportion in the libraries was in accordance with other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-Lu1">[24]</xref>. So, given the satisfactory quality of all libraries&#x02019; parameters, further analysis was performed. Before mapping or annotation, specific and common reads were assessed in each library. The libraries that presented more common sequences were PA and PAA, which share genomes P and A. This work shows that also in the small transcriptome, the increase of the gene dosage in <italic>S. alburnoides</italic> does not seem to promote a big change, since PA/PAA pairwise comparison are the most similar profiles in terms of sequences being expressed, reflecting the more or less random inactivation of genomic-specific alleles (A or P) in PAAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-Matos1">[6]</xref>. The high similarity in the small transcriptomes between the two nuclear hybrid forms (PA and PAA) was also demonstrated by pairwise comparison of their expression profiles, which were the most correlated of all the possible pairwise comparisons both in the sequencing and arrays analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041158-g004"><bold>Figures 4</bold></xref>
<bold>and</bold>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041158-g005"><bold>5</bold></xref>). The good correlation in the global miRNA expression between PA and PAA is consistent with a convergent adaptation to similar mRNA environments, supporting once more a compensatory dosage effect in triploids. Indeed, even if there is a shift in the global miRNA expression in one of the forms, the high correlation shows that the fold changes are occurring in the same direction for the majority of miRNAs.</p><p>In order to study modest fold changes in the global miRNA expression, we focused on the small RNAseq data, which has been shown to yield more reliable absolute quantitative measurements and a better approximation of the real transcript content than microarrays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-Marioni1">[25]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-Liu1">[28]</xref>. Microarrays cannot easily discriminate transcripts from repeated sequences nor subtle changes in gene expression levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-Marioni1">[25]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-Liu1">[28]</xref>. In the comparison of PAA to PA, small RNAseq analysis detected a significant difference in the number of up-regulated miRNAs compared with the number of down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041158-g006"><bold>Figure 6A</bold></xref>). Surprisingly, triploids displayed more up-expressed miRNAs than any other diploid genome composition. Besides, the majority of up-regulated miRNAs in PAA/PA were also up-regulated in the other triploid/diploid comparisons (PAA/PP and PAA/AA). If we apply a cutoff of 1 fold change to all the triploid/diploid comparisons, 5 miRNAs were consistently over-expressed: mir-182, mir-183, mir-96, mir-141 and mir-192. However, no particular transcript or group of transcripts sharing the same gene ontology is targeted by all the 5 miRNAs. We concluded that miRNA up-regulation is a generalized response of the genomic shock created by the ploidy increase and no particular pathway is affected. Additivity analysis confirmed the up-regulation scenario, as the expression levels of several miRNAs were higher than expected from genome composition. This is consistent with discovery in plants where Ha <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-Ha3">[29]</xref> reported deviations from the mid-parental value in miRNAs expressed in a newly made allotetraploid hybrid homologous to <italic>Arabidopsis suecica</italic>. More recently, Kenan-Eichler <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041158-KenanEichler1">[30]</xref> found that in wheat the relative amount of miRNAs increases with ploidy level. Consistent with our findings, the wheat study showed that while in most diploid hybrid miRNA expression profiles did not deviate from their mid-parent value, a deviation occur in the allopolyploid.</p><p>Our results reveal two responses, a dosage compensatory one acting in PAA resulting in a small RNA expression profile similar to PA, and a genome wide regulatory response by miRNAs that although moderate could play an important role in the maintenance of a diploid mRNA expression level in the triploids. The last is probably promoting genome stability contributing to the evolutionary success of this allopolyploid complex.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Electric fishing was performed by In&#x000e1;cio A under her authorization from Autoridade Florestal National (from by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery in Portugal) - Credencial de Pesca n&#x000b0; 22/2011.
