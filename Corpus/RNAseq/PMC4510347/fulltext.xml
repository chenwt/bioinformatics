We investigated several pollination-associated parameters in <italic>N. tabacum</italic> flower buds to determine the developmental timing of important events in preparation for successful fertilization. First, we performed hand pollinations in flowers from stages 4 to 11 to study at which developmental stage pollination would produce fruits. A Peroxtesmo test was performed to correlate peroxidase activity on the stigma surface, indicative of stigma receptivity, with fruit set. Pollen tube growth and female gametophyte development were microscopically analyzed in pistils of different developmental stages. Fruits were obtained only after pollinations of flower buds at late stage 7 and older; fruit weight and seed germination capacity increased as the developmental stage of the pollinated flower approached anthesis. Despite positive peroxidase activity and pollen tube growth, pistils at stages 5 and 6 were unable to produce fruits. At late stage 7, female gametophytes were undergoing first mitotic division. After 24 h, female gametophytes of unpollinated pistils were still in the end of the first division, whereas those of pollinated pistils showed egg cells. RT-qPCR assay showed that the expression of the <italic>NtEC1</italic> gene, a marker of egg cell development, is considerably higher in pollinated late stage 7 ovaries compared with unpollinated ovaries. To test whether ethylene is the signal eliciting female gametophyte maturation, the expression of ACC synthase was examined in unpollinated and pollinated stage 6 and late stage 7 stigmas/styles. Pollination induced <italic>NtACS</italic> expression in stage 6 pistils, which are unable to produce fruits. Our results show that pollination is a stimulus capable of triggering female gametophyte development in immature tobacco flowers and suggests the existence of a yet undefined signal sensed by the pistil.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>stigma receptivity</kwd><kwd>pollen tube growth</kwd><kwd>pollination signal</kwd><kwd>female gametophyte development</kwd><kwd>fruit weight</kwd><kwd>seed germination capacity</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="c001">CAPES</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="c002">FAPESP</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="c003">CNPq</funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="45"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Angiosperms correspond to a group of plants with distinct characteristics, including the presence of ovules enclosed in a maternal organ, know as the pistil. The pistil is generally composed of a stigma, a style, and an ovary that develops into a fruit after fertilization. The fertilization process begins with the deposition of pollen grains onto a receptive stigma surface. When pollen grain recognition and acceptance occurs, it will hydrate and germinate, producing a pollen tube that grows through the style in the direction of the ovary until reaching an embryo sac, known as the angiosperm female gametophyte. Next, the pollen tube bursts, releasing two sperm cells in the interior of the embryo sac. One of the sperm cells fuses to the egg cell to produce a diploid embryo, whereas the second sperm cell fuses to the central cell, generating a triploid endosperm (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Lersten, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Successful reproduction in angiosperms depends on a series of cell&#x02013;cell interactions between male gametophytes and the specialized tissues of the pistil and female gametophytes (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Beale and Johnson, 2013</xref>). Over the last few years, new information and discoveries have increased our knowledge about the signals produced by the female gametophytes to attract and direct the pollen tubes (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Beale and Johnson, 2013</xref>). However, less is known about signals produced by the pollen tube or pistil in response to pollen tube growth, establishing communication with female gametophytes. Some evidence of this male&#x02013;female directional signaling comes from studies of orchid species, in which ovule differentiation and development are pollination-dependent (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and O&#x02019;Neill, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019;Neill, 1997</xref>). Once inside the ovule, the orchid pollen tube waits for the female gametophyte to complete development before releasing sperm cells to promote fertilization (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019;Neill et al., 1993</xref>). In other plants, such as almond, the ovule is partially developed at anthesis and reaches full maturation only after pollination (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Pimienta and Polito, 1983</xref>). This pattern of female gametophyte development triggered by pollination stimulus has also been observed for sweet pepper (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Ofosu-Anim et al., 2006</xref>) and maize (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000f3;l et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>In breeding programs, researchers may perform bud pollination to overcome incongruity in interspecific crosses or self-incompatibility. Hand pollination using mature pollen can be performed on immature flowers (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Haring et al., 1990</xref>) in an attempt to bypass the effects of self-incompatibility on species of Brassicaceae (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Hiscock and Dickinson, 1993</xref>), as well as Solanaceae species (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chalivendra et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic>, a species with a Polygonum-type embryo sac (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Huang and Russell, 1992</xref>), the ovule is not fully developed at anthesis, and the egg cell is not usually observed at the embryo sacs (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Tian and Russell, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Lobanova and Enaleeva, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">De Martinis and Mariani, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). In this species, the effects of pollination on ovule development have mainly been examined at stages close to anthesis. Hand-pollinated tobacco flower buds 12 h before anthesis reach the mature embryo sac stage earlier than flower buds emasculated and not pollinated (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Tian and Russell, 1997</xref>), suggesting the existence of a male&#x02013;female directional signaling. <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">De Martinis and Mariani (1999)</xref> noted that pollinations in young flower buds (stage 6) do not induce embryo sac formation and seed production, but they did not investigate this aspect in detail. Thus, little is known regarding the developmental timing of important events in preparation for successful fertilization in <italic>N. tabacum</italic> flowers.</p><p>Our hypothesis is that pollinations performed on young flower buds will be effective and produce fruits, despite the fact that <italic>N. tabacum</italic> female gametophytes are not fully developed at anthesis. At which flower developmental stage pollination will be productive? We have examined several parameters related to reproductive success (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Calixto et al., 2009</xref>), such as fruit formation, seed production and germination capacity, and correlated them with stigma receptivity based on peroxidase activity, microscopy analysis of pollen tube growth, embryo sac development, and <italic>NtEC1</italic> (<italic>Egg Cell 1</italic>) gene expression. Our results represent a detailed analysis of the effects of pollination on <italic>N. tabacum</italic> flower buds at stages prior to anthesis and shows that preparation for successful fertilization is a gradual process in which the necessary requirements are achieved in phases. This work provides evidence for the existence of male&#x02013;female signaling produced by pollination and considers whether ethylene could be this signal through an investigation of ACC synthase expression. We have shown that a yet undefined pollination signal is sensed by the <italic>N. tabacum</italic> pistil throughout half of its development and is sufficient to trigger cellular and molecular female gametophyte maturation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant Material</title><p>Seeds from <italic>N. tabacum</italic> cv. Petit Havana SR1 were sown in expanded polystyrene trays containing PlantMax commercial substrate (Eucatex, Brazil). After germination and growth to a height of approximately 3 cm, plantlets were transferred to plastic bags and later to 20 L vases. During germination and growth, plants were cultivated in standard greenhouse conditions and irrigated by aspersion. The stages of tobacco flower development were determined using parameters previously described by <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Koltunow et al.

Stage 12 flowers were not included in this work because they are naturally pollinated at this stage. For each analyzed stage, a minimum of eight pistils (from at least six independent plants) were hand pollinated and labeled with sewing threads of different colors. Approximately 20 days after pollination, the pollinated pistils were analyzed for the presence or absence of fruits. The obtained fruits were collected individually and dried at room temperature for approximately 2 days. On the third day, fruits were separately weighed on a precision balance (Acculab &#x02013; L series). The data obtained were analyzed statistically using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) of PROC GLM (software SAS version 9). When variation between two stages was detected, differences with <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of Seed Germination</title><p>To establish the germination capacity of the seeds produced, 300 seeds (from fruits obtained at each developmental stage) were placed in sterile wet filter paper (100 seeds per plate). Two weeks later, the number of germinated seeds was counted, and the results were analyzed using Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test (<italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of Stigma Receptivity</title><p>To study the stigma receptivity, we used special peroxidase test papers (Peroxtesmo KO, Macherey-Nagel &#x02013; D&#x000fc;ren, Germany) as proposed by <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Dafni and Mau&#x000e9;s (1998)</xref>. For this purpose, four stigmas from tobacco flowers at stages 4 to 11 were pressed against peroxidase test-paper and were regarded as positive when blue coloration developed.</p></sec><sec><title>Analyses of Pollen Tube Growth</title><p>Controlled hand pollinations were performed with stages 4&#x02013;11 tobacco pistils, as described above. According to <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">De Graaf et al. (2003)</xref>, pollen tubes reach the tobacco ovary 24 h after pollination. Thus, pollinated pistils were excised 24 h after hand pollination. Stigmas/styles and ovaries were separated and immediately fixed in FPA 50 [2.5 mL of 37% formaldehyde (Sigma), 2.5 mL of propionic acid (Vetec &#x02013; Brazil), and 45 mL of 50% ethanol (Merck)]. The samples were subjected to 15 mmHg vacuum for 15 min in the presence of the fixative. This procedure was repeated four times, and the material was left on the fixative overnight. The fixative was substituted by 50% ethanol, and the material was incubated at 8&#x000b0;C overnight. The next day, 50% ethanol was substituted by 70% ethanol. Longitudinally hand-opened stigmas/styles and ovaries were placed on a glass slide and stained in a 0.1% solution of aniline blue in 0.1 N K<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Kho and Bera, 1968</xref>). The samples were carefully squashed between a glass slide and coverslip in the aniline blue solution, revealing the pollen tube callose plugs. Visualization and documentation were performed with a Zeiss Axiolab epifluorescence microscope (HBO 103W/2 lamp) using an excitation wavelength of 450/90 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm. Images were taken using a Zeiss AxioCam Color 412-312 and AxioVision LE4.8 software.</p></sec><sec><title>Microscopic Analyses of Pollinated and Unpollinated Ovaries</title><p>Late stage 7 flowers (35 mm) were emasculated and kept unpollinated or were pollinated with pollen grains from stage 12 flowers (anthesis). Ovaries from both pollinated and unpollinated flowers were harvested after 24 h and fixed in FAA 50 [5 mL of glacial acetic acid (Merck), 5 mL of 37% formaldehyde (Sigma), and 90 mL of 50% ethanol (Merck)] for 24 h (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Johansen, 1940</xref>). Then, the samples were transferred to 50% ethanol and subsequently to 70% ethanol, in which they were stored. The ovaries were dehydrated in a graded ethanol/xylol series and embedded in paraffin. The embedded material was sliced into 6-&#x003bc;m sections, mounted on microscope slides and stained with 0.05% of toluidine blue pH 6.8. The pictures were taken using a Leica DM50 microscope equipped with a Leica DFC 320 digital camera.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA Extraction, cDNA Synthesis, and RT-qPCR Analysis</title><p>As described above, stage 6 and late stage 7 flowers were emasculated and kept unpollinated or were pollinated with mature pollen. After 24 h, stigmas/styles and ovaries were collected in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80&#x000b0;C (three biological replicates for each condition, each replicate containing three pistil samples). The RNA of each sample was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. RNA integrity was checked by electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose and 20 mM guanidine isothiocyanate gel. RNA samples were treated with RNase-free DNase (Promega<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions and an aliquot was used to check for genomic DNA contamination in a standard qPCR with GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) primers (see below). DNA-free RNA was cleaned using <italic>Clean up &#x02013; Rneasy Mini Kit</italic> (Qiagen) and quantified in a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific). SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) was used to generate cDNA from 1 &#x003bc;g of the RNA samples. qPCR experiments were carried out in three technical replicates on an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System. Each reaction was composed of 5 &#x003bc;L of GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (Promega), 1 &#x003bc;L of sterile Milli-Q purified water, 1 &#x003bc;L (2.5 &#x003bc;M) of each adequate primer (GAPDH forward GCATCTTTGATGCCAAGGCTGGAA and GAPDH reverse TCGAGTGCTGTAGCCCATTTCGTT; RPL2 forward CGGGTGTGTCACTTTCCGTTACCCG and reverse ATACCCTCAGCAGCCACGAAC; NtEC1 forward CTGTTGGCCTTCTATGCTTACT and reverse GGTTGAGGTGATGGAGTTC; and NtACS forward TTCAGAGCCTGGTTGGTTTAG and reverse GACTCCTCCTTCAATCCCTTTAC), and 2 &#x003bc;L of cDNA. The cycling conditions consisted of a initial step of 50&#x000b0;C for 2 min and 95&#x000b0;C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 15 s and 60&#x000b0;C for 1 min. RPL2 (Ribosomal Protein L2) and GAPDH were previously validated by our group as the best reference genes for different experimental conditions and pistil samples (unpublished results). The efficiency of primer pairs was determined from the slope of the standard curve using the formula Efficiency (<italic>E</italic>) = 10 (-1/slope) and then converted to percentage efficiency, where % of efficiency = (<italic>E-</italic>1) &#x000d7; 100%. Confirmation of amplicon specificity was based on the dissociation curve at the end of each run (ramp time 55&#x02013;95&#x000b0;C). qPCR reactions in the absence of template were also performed as negative controls for each pair of primers. The expression levels of <italic>NtEC1</italic> and <italic>NtACS</italic> were determined using the formula: 2-&#x00394;Ct, where &#x00394;Ct = (Cttag &#x02013; Ctref), Ct = threshold cycle, tag = tag gene, and ref = reference gene, derived from the 2-&#x00394;&#x00394;Ct method originally published by <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Livak and Schmittgen (2001)</xref>. Relative expression was determined by comparing the <italic>NtEC1</italic> transcript expression level between unpollinated, considered as 1, and pollinated ovaries. For <italic>NtACS</italic>, the expression ratios were determined comparing pollinated with unpollinated pistils for each stage (6 or late 7). Statistical analysis using expression data were performed using the REST tool (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Pfa&#x0fb04; et al., 2002</xref>) and data are available in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>.

Pollinations performed on stigmas at stages 4&#x02013;6 did not produce fruits (<bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref></bold>). Fruit formation was only observed as a result of pollinations performed at later stages (7&#x02013;12). However, although fruits were produced in 100% of pollinations performed at stages 8&#x02013;12, at stage 7, fruit formation was dependent on the specific size of the flower bud (<bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref></bold>). Fruits were produced only when the pollinated flower buds were 34 mm or longer. Therefore, we divided the stage 7 initially described by <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Koltunow et al. (1990)</xref> into early stage 7, with flower buds with sizes between 28 and 33 mm, and late stage 7, with flower buds with sizes between 34 and 38 mm. Fruits obtained by this analysis were weighted and photographed. The mean fruit weight increased in accordance with the flower developmental stage in which pollination was performed, i.e., the fruit was heavier at later stages (<bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref></bold>). ANOVA and contrast comparison statistical analyses were performed and demonstrated no significant difference in relation to the mean fruit weight produced among pollinations performed at late stage 7 and stages 8 and 9 (<bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref></bold>).

For this purpose, pistils from different development stages (4 to 11) were hand pollinated with mature pollen grains obtained from open flowers (stage 12). Pistils were collected 24 h after pollination, a period of time sufficient for pollen tubes to reach the ovary (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">De Graaf et al., 2003</xref>). After aniline blue staining, the pollen tubes were observed under fluorescence microscopy. In pollinations performed on stage 4 pistils, the pollen grains tended not to remain on the stigma surface, and no pollen hydration was observed. Consequently, no growing pollen tubes were detected on the stigma or style or at the ovary (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;C</xref></bold>). For pollinations performed on pistils of stage 5 flower buds, the pollen grains on the stigma surface hydrated and emitted pollen tubes (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D,E</xref></bold>). It was also possible to visualize pollen tubes growing through the entire style length, reaching the ovary (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref></bold>) and ovules (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>).

Late stage 7 flower buds (35 mm long) were emasculated and either hand pollinated with mature pollen or left unpollinated. This developmental stage was chosen because it is the earliest stage in which fruit formation was observed. After 24 h, the ovaries were collected and prepared for histological analysis.

As a major achievement, we determined the effects of pollination in <italic>N. tabacum</italic> ovule development in flower buds prior to anthesis. At stage 5, the stigma is already receptive, displaying positive peroxidase activity and consistently supporting pollen tube growth through the style. Controlled hand pollinations at different developmental stages demonstrated that fruit formation occurred only at late stage 7 (34&#x02013;38 mm) onward. Pollinations at stages 5, 6 and early stage 7 did not result in fruits despite stigma receptivity. Based on the developmental and physiological differences concerning fruit formation between 28&#x02013;33 mm and 34&#x02013;38 mm stage 7 flower buds, we propose to divide stage 7, previously described by <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Koltunow et al. (1990)</xref>, into early stage 7 and late stage 7, respectively.</p><p>Effective pollination, which results in fruit set, is mainly determined by stigma receptivity, pollen tube kinetics, and ovule development (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Sanzol and Herrero, 2001</xref>). Our results on positive peroxidase activity correlated with the stigma&#x02019;s ability to sustain pollen tube growth or, in other words, stigma receptivity. However, the developmental stages of stigmas/styles influenced the number of growing pollen tubes (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold>); later developmental stages exhibited higher capacities to sustain a larger number of growing pollen tubes. In some species, the low number of pollen tubes is directly related to fruit abortion (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Sutherland, 1987</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bj&#x000f6;rkman, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Niesenbaum, 1999</xref>). Our results show that in <italic>N. tabacum</italic>, there is a direct correlation between the developmental stage of the pollinated pistil, the amount of growing pollen tubes, and fruit set (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref></bold>; <bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref></bold>). Therefore, an additional important parameter to be considered for effective pollination is the number of pollen tubes growing through the style.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>FIGURE 6</label><caption><p><bold>Phases of tobacco pistil development in preparation for successful pollination and fertilization.</bold> Phase 0 represents the initial developmental stages in which no preparation for pollination exists. Phase 1 was defined as the onset of stigma receptivity (positive peroxidase activity at the stigma surface and sustainable pollen tube growth through the style) until the developmental moment in which pollination results in fruit set. Phase 2 represents the turning point, in which pollinations become productive and are restricted to late stage 7. Phase 3 is comprised of the developmental stages 8&#x02013;11, in which gradual improvements in fruit weight and seed germination capacity occur.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpls-06-00561-g006"/></fig><p>Which developmental changes in the pistil can affect the number of growing pollen tubes? Pollen tube growth is heterotrophic, and stages 5, 6 and early stage 7 tobacco pistils may not have sufficient carbohydrates to sustain a large number of pollen tubes. An alternative explanation is that styles younger than late stage 7 may not have the necessary intercellular spaces between cells of the transmitting tissue. Tobacco pollen tubes grow in the intercellular spaces of the specialized tissues of the stigma/style, and, at anthesis, these cells are loosely arranged and easily separated (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Cresti et al., 1986</xref>). The developmentally regulated expression of a pistil-specific pectin acetylesterase gene, which is important for decreasing cell adhesion among these cells (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Quiapim et al., 2009</xref>) and some other morphological and/or physiological factors, may limit the number of pollen tubes growing in pistils younger than late stage 7. A sharp developmental threshold exists: tobacco flower buds with 33 mm or less in length do not have the necessary characteristics to sustain enough pollen tubes and thus to produce a sufficient number of fertilized ovules. Tobacco flower buds of 34 mm and longer are capable of expressing or have already accumulated all the factors required for growth of a minimum number of pollen tubes and thus for fruit production.</p><p>Concerning ovule development, our results clearly show that at late stage 7, ovules are still immature and the female gametophytes are at the beginning of the first mitotic division. Therefore, it is surprising that pollinations at this developmental stage produce fruits and seeds. Our detailed analyses of pollinations performed on late stage 7 pistils demonstrated the effect of accelerating female gametophyte maturation. The pollination effect in triggering ovule maturation was demonstrated both by histological analysis as well as expression of the <italic>NtEC1</italic> gene. In this context, a signal is clearly produced in response to pollen tube growth through the stigma/style and reaches the ovules. What is the nature of this signal? Several types of signals have already been identified as mediators during plant reproduction, such as ethylene (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019;Neill et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">De Martinis and Mariani, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Woodson, 1999</xref>) and its precursor ACC (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Woodson, 1999</xref>), gamma-amino butyric acid (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Palanivelu et al., 2003</xref>), IAA (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Zhao, 2008</xref>), jasmonic acid and its derivatives (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Avanci et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Stitz et al., 2014</xref>), calcium (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Tian and Russell, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Ge et al., 2009</xref>), and peptides (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Higashiyama, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chae and Lord, 2011</xref>). Pollination acts as a stimulus and increases the concentration of calcium and ethylene in <italic>N. tabacum</italic> flowers (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Tian and Russell, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">De Martinis and Mariani, 1999</xref>). ACC oxidase-silenced transgenic plants and with impaired ethylene synthesis are unable to complete female gametophyte development (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">De Martinis and Mariani, 1999</xref>). In addition, application of ethylene restores female gametophyte development in these transgenic flowers (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">De Martinis and Mariani, 1999</xref>). Furthermore, the concentrations of enzymes related to ethylene synthesis are altered in response to pollination in Solanaceae species (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Llop-Tous et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Weterings et al., 2002</xref>). These studies were mainly conducted with flowers at developmental stages close to anthesis. However, no detailed study was previously performed to investigate the effect(s) of pollination in young tobacco flower buds, and little is known about the signal(s) produced at these earlier stages.</p><p>We investigated the expression of the ACC synthase gene as an attempt to identify the pollination signal that triggers female gametophyte maturation at young pistils. The results show that stage 6 pistils, which are unable to produce fruits, induce <italic>NtACS</italic> expression in a pollination-dependent manner. This result is consistent with the literature (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Weterings et al., 2002</xref>) and suggests that ACC and/or ethylene is not the primary signal necessary for ovule maturation, at least at early stages of flower development. An alternative explanation is that the ACC and/or ethylene produced at stage 6 does not reach a threshold level and is thus insufficient to trigger the maturation observed at late stage 7. Additionally, ovule maturation is dependent on perception of the pollination signal. Therefore, it is possible that although stage 6 stigmas/styles produce the pollination signal (e.g., ACC and/or ethylene), ovules do not express the signal receptor yet and are incompetent to respond. We remain unable to define the nature of the pollination signal, but it can travel fast and/or act as a long-range signal, reaching embryo sacs located a few centimeters away. Additionally, this pollination signal is so strong that it is capable of overwriting the natural developmental program within the tobacco ovule and accelerates female gametophyte maturation in anticipation of fertilization.</p><p>Tobacco pistil development occurs in multiple stage-specific phases along the pistil path (stigma, style, and ovary) in preparation for pollination and fertilization. We propose that phase 0 comprises the initial developmental stages (stages 1&#x02013;4), from stigma differentiation until the onset of stigma receptivity. Phase 1 represents the first pistil indicator of a preparation for pollination: the onset of peroxidase activity at the stigma surface, which parallels the capacity of sustaining pollen tube growth or stigma receptivity (stages 5 to early stage 7). At this phase, a few pollen tubes reach the ovules but do not penetrate them (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>). Phase 2 could be defined as a turning point based on an array of physiological acquisitions that allow a large number of pollen tubes to grow a long distance, reaching, and penetrating the ovules. Thus, late stage 7 corresponds to a critical developmental moment, in which sufficient pollination signal(s) is(are) produced and embryo sacs are capable of perceiving and responding. Hence, female gametophyte maturation is triggered; fruits and seeds are produced. However, the fruits are small, and not all seeds are able to germinate (the germination rate was 65% &#x000b1; 5.7% for late stage 7 pollination), suggesting that pollination is sufficient but that a parallel mechanism (secondary signals or cellular development) should take place for proper seed formation (stages 11 and 12). Phase 3 is comprised of intermediate developmental stages (stages 8&#x02013;11) in which gradual improvements take place, resulting in increasingly larger and heavier fruits (which is correlated with the number of seeds), containing seeds with progressively higher germination capacity (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref></bold>). Phase 4, likely representing the best pollination and fertilization conditions, should occur at anthesis (stage 12), a developmental moment not analyzed in this work.</p><p>In recent years, knowledge has increased considerably concerning the responses elicited at the pollen tube in response to its growth along the pistil path and the signals produced by the pistil which are perceived by the pollen (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Qin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Palanivelu and Johnson, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Palanivelu and Tsukamoto, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Beale and Johnson, 2013</xref>). However, little is known about the pollination signal and the responses triggered at the stigma/style and ovary (the female responses during pollen&#x02013;pistil interactions). Our results indicate the existence of a powerful program that guarantees the coordinated and synchronized development of male and female gametophytes, ensuring successful reproduction. It would be interesting to perform RNASeq studies to identify genes expressed at different parts of the style, as well as in ovaries, in pollinated, and unpollinated pistils at different developmental stages and at different time points after pollination. These studies would help establish the time necessary for induction/commitment, its physiological basis and, eventually, identification of the pollination signal receptor. Additionally, investigation of the nature of the pollination signal and pistil requirements to perceive it could be useful for the success of self-incompatible and interspecific crosses performed in evolutionary studies and breeding programs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the University of Nijmegen for providing us with <italic>Nicotiana</italic> seeds.
