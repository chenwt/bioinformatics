Both the function of C9ORF72 and the mechanism by which the repeat expansion drives neuropathology are unknown. To examine whether C9ORF72 haploinsufficiency induces neurological disease, we created a C9orf72-deficient mouse line. Null mice developed a robust immune phenotype characterized by myeloid expansion, T cell activation, and increased plasma cells. Mice also presented with elevated autoantibodies and evidence of immune-mediated glomerulonephropathy. Collectively, our data suggest that C9orf72 regulates immune homeostasis and an autoimmune response reminiscent of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) occurs in its absence. We further imply that haploinsufficiency is unlikely to be the causative factor in C9ALS/FTD pathology.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The <italic>C9ORF72</italic> locus has been researched extensively following identification of an expanded hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) repeat in <italic>C9ORF72</italic> as the most common cause of sporadic and familial forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. FTD is characterized by cognitive and behavioral symptoms and ALS by motor neuron degeneration, yet extensive genetic, clinical, and neuropathological overlap indicate the two conditions form opposite ends of a continuous disease spectrum<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Patients may develop ALS, FTD, or both (C9ALS/FTD) and generally carry one normal allele comprised of 2&#x02013;16 copies of the repeat and an expanded pathogenic allele with repeats numbering in the hundreds to thousands.</p><p>The <italic>C9ORF72</italic> repeat is intronic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, therefore the mechanism by which the repeat expansion causes neuronal cell death is unclear. Toxic buildup of unspliced, repetitive mRNAs is one theory. Studies have demonstrated that <italic>C9ORF72</italic> repeats sequester certain RNA binding proteins into cytoplasmic foci, perhaps reducing or preventing protein synthesis needed for normal cellular processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. An alternate hypothesis implicates insoluble dipeptide chains arising from Repeat-Associated non-ATG (RAN) translation of the repeats. C9ALS/FTD autopsy brain sections contain cytoplasmic poly-glycine-proline peptide inclusions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> that could cause neurotoxicity in a manner similar to the neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques of Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Both theories cast the repeat as a gain-of-function lesion that may or may not impact the function of <italic>C9ORF72</italic> itself.</p><p>A third theory to explain C9ALS/FTD pathogenicity is haploinsufficiency of <italic>C9ORF72</italic>. Repeat expansion as a loss-of-function mutation is suggested by studies on repeat carriers who express roughly half as much <italic>C9ORF72</italic> transcript as individuals with two unexpanded copies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. In addition, the repeat can cause DNA and RNA to form four-stranded G-quadruplexes. Poor transcription/translation of quadruplexed DNA/RNA also implicate haploinsufficiency, and therefore impaired <italic>C9ORF72</italic> function as pathogenic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.</p><p>Functional studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and zebrafish support the haploinsufficiency hypothesis by demonstrating that a reduction in C9ORF72 homolog levels results in locomotion defects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. However, mouse studies suggest otherwise. Conditional <italic>C9orf72</italic> ablation in neurons and glial cells or intracerebral mRNA knockdown did not cause motor neuron disease, gliosis, TDP-43 pathology, or increased ubiquitination, defects associated with C9ALS/FTD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. These results imply haploinsufficiency in the central nervous system (CNS) is not pathogenic; however ablation may not have occurred in a crucial cell type and knockdown could have allowed residual C9orf72 expression. The conflicting results and variability intrinsic to cell-specific gene ablation or message knockdown warrant further study of <italic>C9orf72</italic> in a universal knockout (<italic>C9orf72</italic><sup><italic><bold>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</bold></italic></sup>).</p><p>In this study, we separate effects intrinsic to the repeat from the function of C9ORF72 by genetically ablating the mouse homolog, <italic>3110043O21Rik</italic> (hereafter referred to as <italic>C9orf72</italic>). Heterozygous (<italic>C9orf72</italic><sup>+/&#x02212;</sup>) mice were healthy and lived normal lifespans.

Mild, nonspecific neurological deficits arose after the immune response was established but <italic>C9orf72</italic> ablation did not result in classic motor neuron degeneration. Our results indicate haploinsufficiency is not the main cause of C9ALS/FTD neuropathology and describe a novel role for C9ORF72 in immune homeostasis.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>C9orf72</italic><sup>

To address these possibilities, histopathology was conducted on spleen and LN from 8&#x02013;60 week old mice. The basic cellular organization of the enlarged <italic>C9orf72</italic><sup><italic><bold>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</bold></italic></sup> LN was preserved, with immunohistochemistry (IHC) identifying a B cell-rich rim (CD45R<sup>+</sup>) arranged in follicles within the cortex and a T cell (CD3<sup>+</sup>) infiltrate between follicles and in the paracortex zone (data not shown). A mixed cell population consisting mostly of large round cells with variably distinct borders, a single round nucleus, and eosinophilic, foamy cytoplasm expanded the cortical and medullary nodal architecture. A similar cellular infiltrate was present in <italic>C9orf72</italic><sup><italic><bold>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</bold></italic></sup> spleen, predominantly located within the red pulp, expanding the splenic architecture and corresponding to grossly increased spleen weights.

Abundant plasmacytoid cells containing perinuclear halos, consistent with plasma cell morphology, and occasional Mott cells (enlarged plasma cells containing cytoplasmic immunoglobulin (Ig) inclusions) were also present.

Locomotor behaviors were evaluated for 60&#x02009;minutes every other week using the automated Open Field system (Kinder Scientific), which measures fine movements, X+Y ambulation, distance traveled, number of rearing events, time spent rearing, and immobility time via infrared beam breaks. Rotarod (IITC Life Science, Woodland Hills, CA) was used to measure the latency for a mouse to fall from a rotating beam with a ramping speed, starting at 1 rpm and accelerating to 15 rpm over 180 seconds. The average and maximum of the three longest durations of time that the animals stay on the beam without falling were used to evaluate latency.
