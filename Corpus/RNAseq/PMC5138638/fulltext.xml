Various powerful visualization techniques are provided, generating high quality figures that can be directly incorporated into scientific publications. Robust and comprehensive analyses are provided via a broad range of data-mining techniques, including univariate and multivariate statistical analysis, supervised learning, correlation networks, clustering and multivariable regression. The software has a focus on multivariate techniques, which can attribute variance in the measurements to multiple explanatory variables and confounders. Various normalization methods are provided. Extensive help pages and a tutorial are available via a wiki server. Using GMine we reanalyzed proteome microarray data of host antibody response against <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. Our results support the hypothesis that immunity to malaria is a higher-order phenomenon related to a pattern of responses and not attributable to any single antigen. We also analyzed gene expression across resting and activated T cells, identifying many immune-related genes with differential expression. This highlights both the plasticity of T cells and the operation of a hardwired activation program. These application examples demonstrate that GMine facilitates an accurate and in-depth analysis of complex molecular datasets, including genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics data.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The development of high-throughput molecular assays has revolutionized medical and biomolecular research and has greatly advanced genome, transcriptome and proteome analysis. Researchers are now able to rapidly and cost-effectively profile gene transcription, protein abundances, immune responses, DNA methylation, histone occupancy, microRNA expression, or metagenomic gene frequencies. Measurements are frequently obtained for hundreds to thousands of features and across multiple samples, biological conditions and time-points. Common characteristics of the generated data are their complexity, multidimensionality and multivariate nature, where variance in the measurements can be attributed to multiple explanatory variables and possible confounders. Analysis of the generated data therefore requires the application of advanced data-mining techniques, multivariate statistics and powerful visualization methods for data exploration.</p><p>Several computational tools are available for the analysis of complex biomolecular datasets, such as data generated by protein microarrays or NanoString expression data. The Cyber-T web server<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> allows data transformation and data comparison via Bayesian t-test and ANOVA. The standalone MeV MultiExperiment Viewer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> provides powerful methods for data visualization and clustering. Matrix2png<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> allows visualization of microarray data and other data types via a heatmap. Additionally, a multitude of R packages are available for the analysis of protein microarrays and other biomolecular data. However, thorough and meaningful analysis of complex biomolecular data using these currently available tools is frequently hampered by the advanced computational skills generally required to use them, by their limited selection of statistical methods, or by the lack of visualization capabilities.</p><p>To address this, we developed GMine, a powerful, yet easy to use tool for the higher-level analysis of biomolecular data. GMine allows the analysis of any genomic, metagenomic, transcriptomic or proteomic dataset with several hundred to several thousand biological features (e.g. genes or proteins) across different samples and biological conditions. Measurements can represent intensities, frequencies or counts (e.g. signal intensities, expression values, methylation levels, or sequence read counts generated in metagenomic, ChIP-seq or RNA-seq experiments). The software has been developed with an initial focus on protein microarray antibody responses and NanoString gene expression data. These two techniques are becoming widely used in biomolecular and medical research, but there is a general lack of available easy-to-use software for the analysis of the generated data.</p><p>Whole-proteome microarrays are increasingly popular for vaccine target antigen identification, studying immune responses, biomarker discovery, and clinical diagnostics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In the field of infectious diseases, protein microarrays are widely used for measuring host immune response to proteins of infectious agents, including malaria, schistosomes or viruses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Protein microarrays allow measurement of antibody responses against the entire proteome of a pathogen. This results in large and complex datasets, with signal intensities measured for thousands of proteins and hundreds of samples. In addition, antibody responses can be attributed to multiple covariates, including gender, age, geographic location, or infection history. The analysis of this type of data therefore requires advanced statistical methods that can assess complex associations while accounting for the various contributing confounding variables; this is enabled by GMine.</p><p>NanoString technology performs multiplex quantification of gene expression with high levels of precision and sensitivity, and can detect very small changes of a single transcript. Given the capacity to directly &#x02018;count&#x02019; molecules, the platform is free from the inherent multiplex/PCR bias seen in other technologies, such as qPCR, microarray or RNAseq. NanoString enables the precise quantification of expression levels of a large number of genes across multiple biological samples and changes in gene expression can usually be attributed to multiple explanatory variables and confounding factors. The analysis of the generated high-dimensional and multivariate data therefore requires the application of advanced data-mining methods, which is now possible via the GMine web-server.</p><p>To demonstrate the utility of GMine for proteome and expression data, we applied our software to two types of studies. First, we used GMine to further analyze previously published proteome microarray data generated in a prospective study investigating host immune response to the malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Our intent was to apply GMine to this existing dataset to identify <italic>P. falciparum</italic> antigens associated with protection from clinical malaria, in order to facilitate the rational design of malaria vaccines. As a second applied study, we used GMine to analyze gene transcription occurring during the course of T cell activation, by comparing the expression of 135 key genes in resting and activated primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. These two T cell subtypes play crucial roles in orchestrating and executing human immune system function, and understanding their molecular basis is important for guiding and modulating function for preventive or therapeutic purposes.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>GMine Server and User Interface</title><p>Genomics Data Miner (GMine) is accessible via a free web-server, which provides a user-friendly interface to advanced statistical methods and data-mining algorithms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The web-frontend is implemented in Java using the JavaServer Faces architecture and the backend is implemented in Perl and the R statistical programming environment. The user interface is based on HTML and Cascading Style Sheets and interactive visualizations have been realized using JavaScript. No installation, configuration, registration or login is required. Data is kept privately and cannot be viewed by other users. Uploaded data and calculated results are deleted after a user session has terminated. Extensive help pages and a tutorial are provided via a wiki server. GMine is freely available at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cgenome.net/GMine/">http://cgenome.net/GMine/</ext-link>.</p><p>The web-frontend provides several analysis tabs that provide access to different data-mining methods (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). High-quality figures are generated in PNG, PDF or SVG format, which can readily be used across an array of scientific outputs. The SVG format allows an easy modification of figures in vector graphics editors, such as Inkscape. Generated figures can be adjusted according to user preferences, including color scheme, coloring of samples by biological condition, figure resolution and figure dimensions.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Data Upload and Normalization</title><p>As input, GMine requires an &#x02018;n&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;m&#x02019; data matrix and a metadata file providing meta-information for each sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S1</xref>). The server can be used for any n&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;m data matrix (with n&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;m&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;two million), where the columns correspond to samples, the rows represent features (e.g. proteins) and the values of the data matrix represent measured intensities, frequencies or counts (e.g. signal intensities, expression values, or methylation levels). Input files are simple text files in tab separated or comma separated format and can be created in spreadsheet programs such as Excel. The data upload page provides several normalization and data transformation methods, including quantile normalization, centered log ratio and variance stabilization and calibration for microarray data (VSN) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The effects of transformation and normalization procedures on the data are visualized by boxplots and scatterplots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S1</xref>). The provided VSN algorithm was originally developed for gene expression microarrays, and is now also widely used for the normalization of protein array data. VSN corrects for the dependency between intensity and variance, which can bias the analysis in standard statistical procedures. The algorithm transforms the data such that the variance remains nearly constant over the whole intensity spectrum.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Analysis Enabled by GMine</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Quantitative visualization and univariate data analysis</title><p>Data is visualized quantitatively using heatmaps, bubble plots, scatter plots, stripcharts, barcharts and boxplots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">7</xref>). Biological conditions or classes (e.g. case/control) can be compared with a wide range of parametric and non-parametric statistical tests (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>) and p-values are adjusted for multiple testing by FDR and Bonferroni correction. Distribution of p-values is presented as histograms and quantile-quantile (QQ) plots. QQ plots characterize the extent to which the observed distribution of the test statistics follows the expected (null) distribution. This allows the detection of evidence for systematic bias. GMine also facilitates hypothesis testing by the Bayesian t-test, which addresses problems associated with low replication levels and technology biases and has been proposed for the analysis of DNA microarrays, protein arrays, quantitative mass spectrometry and next-generation sequencing (RNA-seq) data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Multivariate analysis</title><p>Multivariate statistics are powerful techniques that can identify complex associations between measurements and multiple explanatory variables. GMine provides a wide range of unsupervised multivariate methods for ordination and clustering (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). When visualizing data in heatmaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">7a</xref>), GMine allows trimming of outliers, selection of the color palette and adjustment of the color range center.</p><p>The significance of associations between measurements and multiple explanatory variables can be examined using the supervised statistical methods redundancy analysis (RDA), canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), and multivariable regression. GMine further enables data analysis by Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS), a multivariate methods which can identify associations between individual features and multiple explanatory variables.</p><p>Correlation networks visualize positive and negative associations between features, between explanatory variables, and between features and explanatory variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">7e</xref>). Features and explanatory variables are represented as nodes and measures as node sizes. Edges represent positive (yellow) and negative (blue) associations. Nodes are ordinated in the network by principal coordinates analysis (PCoA), which places correlating nodes in close proximity and anti-correlating nodes at distant locations.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Analysis of repeated measures</title><p>GMine allows for the analysis of experimental data from a repeated measures design. For instance, repeated measures are obtained in longitudinal studies or when multiple samples are collected from different tissues of the same subject, e.g. tumor and matched normal samples. In GMine, repeated measures can be analyzed using mixed effect regression models, which incorporate the individual (or animal or cage) as a random effect and explanatory variables (e.g. case/control or treatment) as fixed effects. These models can distinguish between group-specific effects (e.g. average in cases and controls) and subject or cage-specific effects.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Biomarker discovery and classification</title><p>GMine provides simple yet powerful methods for biomarker discovery. The discriminatory power of the uploaded data to distinguish between two sample groups (e.g. cases/controls) is ascertained using a support vector machine (SVM) evaluated by leave-one-out cross-validation. The discriminatory power of biomarker candidates is described by the area under the curve (AUC), odds ratio, delta (difference in means in units of standard deviation), and fold change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Identification of relevant features from large multidimensional datasets</title><p>The high-dimensionality of biomolecular datasets with far more variables than samples can affect the ability of statistical analysis to extract meaningful information<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Furthermore, biomolecular data frequently contains many features that are either redundant or irrelevant, and can thus be removed without much loss of information. Robust statistical techniques are needed that are able to extract biologically informative features differentiating two or more phenotypes from large multidimensional data. To identify the subset of relevant features predictive of an outcome of interest, GMine provides access to the advanced feature selection methods: step-wise linear regression, LASSO regularized regression, random forest and the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size method (LEfSe)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. LASSO performs both feature selection and regularization to prevent overfitting. Random forest identifies the subset of most relevant features by constructing a collection of decision trees. Overfitting is avoided by constructing trees incorporating only a random subset of the features. LEfSe identifies features most likely to explain differences between classes by coupling standard tests for statistical significance with additional tests encoding biological consistency and effect relevance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. In GMine, selected features are presented as barcharts, where bars depict the importance of each feature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figures S4 and S7</xref>).</p><p>As a preprocessing step, GMine also facilitates the reduction of data dimensionality by factor analysis. The main aim of factor analysis is to remove redundant features (i.e. highly correlating features) without much loss of information. Correlating features are described by a lower number of latent variables, called factors. Following factor analysis, the reduced dataset can be analyzed in GMine using the full range of statistical techniques provided.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Application of GMine for the Analysis of Malaria Protein Microarray Data</title><p>Using GMine, we re-examined protein microarray data generated in a prospective, longitudinal study investigating host immune response to the malaria parasite <italic>P. falciparum</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. The study cohort included 194 individuals from the malaria endemic Kambila region in Mali. From each participant, blood samples were collected before and after the 8-month malaria season. The analyzed dataset represented host antibody response against 491 seropositive <italic>P. falciparum</italic> proteins profiled for 388 serum samples (194 individuals, 2 samples per individual).</p><p>Antibody response to the 491&#x02009;<italic>P. falciparum</italic> proteins was strongly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). However, despite the high level of correlation, antibody profiles were highly subject-specific and clustered by age, time relative to the malaria season (before/after), concurrent parasitemia, incidence of febrile malaria during the 8-month study period, and days until the first malaria episode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2b</xref>). Antibody reactivity to 483&#x02009;<italic>P. falciparum</italic> proteins (98.4% of the 491 seropositive proteins) increased with subject age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>) (ANOVA, FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) and was generally higher after the malaria season (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,c</xref>). Children showed a stronger increase in antibody response than adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>) from before to after the malaria season. The significance of observed associations was tested using the multivariate statistical method redundancy analysis (RDA). In accordance with our clustering results, antibody responses were significantly associated with age, time of sample collection (before or after malaria season) and concurrent parasitemia (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S2</xref>). Age, days until first malaria episode, concurrent parasitemia and time of sample collection at the end of malaria season were positively associated with antibody reactivity; incidence of clinical malaria showed a negative association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S2</xref>). Gender, hemoglobin type and days until the first episode were not associated with antibody reactivity (RDA, p&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S2</xref>).</p><sec disp-level="3"><title>Association between antibody response and immunity to malaria</title><p>We examined the association between antibody response to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> proteins before the malaria season and subsequent immunity to malaria during the 8-month malaria season.

None of the 491 seropositive <italic>P. falciparum</italic> proteins was association with protection from malaria after correction for multiple testing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Association between antibody response and immunity to malaria in children</title><p>To avoid the confounding effect of age on malaria risk, we re-analyzed the association between antibody reactivity to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> proteins and subsequent protection against clinical malaria in the subset of children aged 8 to 10 years. For this analysis we compared antibody profiles of children who did not experience clinical malaria during the 8-month malaria season (&#x0201c;protected&#x0201d;, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;19) versus those who experienced &#x02265;1 malaria episodes (&#x0201c;susceptible&#x0201d;, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;29).</p><p>Protected and susceptible children had remarkably different antibody profiles before the malaria season, with protected children showing higher breadth (number of positive proteins) and stronger reactivity to a wide range of parasite proteins (Cluster 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b and c</xref>). In accordance with our results obtained by unsupervised clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,d</xref>), multivariate analysis showed a significant association between antibody response and protection status (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02, CCA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs 3e</xref> and S3). Antibody profiles against <italic>P. falciparum</italic> proteins were highly predictive of immunity to malaria. A support vector machine (SVM) evaluated by leave-one-out cross-validation was able to predict immunity to malaria with 95% accuracy.</p><p>We identified 62 parasite proteins with significantly increased mean signal intensity in children with resistance to malaria (FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, t-test) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S3</xref>). Three of these 62 proteins were highly associated with resistance (Bonferroni corrected p-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) and were able to discriminate between protected and susceptible children with high accuracy (AUC of 0.8&#x02013;0.9) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figs 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5</xref>). However, antibody reactivity against proteins representing some of the leading malaria vaccine candidates circumsporozoite protein (CSP, PFC0210c), merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1, PFI1475w), merozoite surface protein 2 (MSP-2, PFB0300c), apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA-1, PF11_0344) and liver stage antigen 3 (LSA3, PFB0915w) did not discriminate between protected and susceptible children (FDR&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). The high-dimensionality of the gene expression dataset can potentially affect the ability of standard statistical analysis to extract meaningful information. We therefore additionally analyzed the data using the LEfSe algorithm, which identified 12 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> proteins associated with protection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S9</xref>).</p><p>Our results indicate that immunity to malaria is related to a pattern of responses to multiple parasite proteins and not attributable to any single antigen. We therefore sought to identify the signature of the most relevant proteins associated with protection against clinical malaria. Stepwise forward logistic regression identified a six protein signature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S4</xref>), which achieved perfect separation (AUC of 1) and improved power for discriminating between protected and susceptible children when compared to individual proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S3</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Application of GMine for the Analysis of Gene Expression in Human T Cells Following Activation</title><p>Using GMine, we examined gene expression of primary CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in resting (non-activated) and early activated states of 5 adults.

Robust and thorough analyses are obtained via a broad range of algorithms for clustering, classification and statistical testing. The software enables lab-based researchers, who may be unfamiliar with advanced statistical software packages, to use these complex types of analyses routinely in their work in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of their data.</p><p>Our re-analysis of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> protein array data replicated previous results, demonstrating that GMine facilitates robust analysis of complex biomolecular datasets. In accordance with Crompton <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> we found that antibody responses to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> proteins are associated with time relative to malaria season, subject age and protection from malaria. Consistent with the previous study, we observed that susceptible children have strong reactivity to some proteins, but protected children tend to have a significantly higher breadth of response. These results are consistent with other reports indicating that the breadth of antibody response to malaria proteins rather than strong reactivity to individual proteins is critical for developing immunity to malaria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Antibody response to the malaria vaccine candidates CSP, LSA-3, AMA-1, MSP-1 and MSP-2 did not discriminate between protected and susceptible children in agreement with the previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, as well as with results of clinical trials of candidate AMA-1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> and MSP-1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> vaccines.</p><p>While Crompton <italic>et al</italic>. focused on individual antigens, we extended this study by analyzing antibody reactivity profiles and antibody responses against combinations of parasite antigens. We demonstrated that children who were protected or susceptible to malaria differed in their global antibody reactivity to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> proteins. Antibody profiles of protected and susceptible children formed distinct clusters when analyzed by hierarchical clustering and were predictive of immunity to malaria when using a SVM classifier. Our results further extend previous findings by identifying an antibody signature that dramatically improves the power to discriminate protected from susceptible children as compared with antibody responses to single antigens. These findings support the hypothesis that immunity to malaria is a higher-order phenomenon related to a combination of antibody reactivity rather than to single antibody reactions, consistent with our previous observations in experimentally immunized populations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p><p>We further extended the previous report by showing that antibody reactivity profiles are associated with age and time during the malaria season on a proteome-wide level, as evident by our cluster analysis. Finally, multivariate analysis in GMine found new positive correlations between antibody reactivity against <italic>Plasmodium</italic> proteins and concurrent parasitemia and day until first febrile malaria episode. Gender and hemoglobin type were not associated with antibody response, consistent with previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>.</p><p>We also used GMine to study the expression of 135 key immune-related genes in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the resting and post activation state. The immunomonitoring of these core immune cell subsets has led to the discovery of many biological correlates of disease. A more complete understanding of T cell function will lead to new avenues for immunotherapeutic development. Previous studies have examined changes in human na&#x000ef;ve and memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell phenotypes following mitogen activation using microarrays and found 100&#x02013;300 genes differentially expressed between states<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Our study establishes proof-of-concept for the potential of GMine to dramatically advance this or similar fields, taking advantage of the new direct digital NanoString technology which is free from the inherent biases of PCR. Using a custom 135 gene array designed for the sensitive and precise profiling of key immune-related genes, GMine analyses showed a digital view of T cell gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). Second, using GMine, we found that the gene expression profiles of CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are unique at rest but very similar post activation. The latter was a surprising finding and suggests the existence of a common &#x0201c;hardwired&#x0201d; activation system across many highly diverse human T cell lineages. To our knowledge this has not been described or investigated previously; with prior studies investigating only a single lineage. to our knowledge, previous studies investigated only a single lineage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.

Correlation of CD4<sup>+</sup> gene expression levels presented as heatmap (<bold>d</bold>) and network (<bold>e</bold>). Correlation of CD4<sup>+</sup> gene expression levels was measured by Pearson&#x02019;s correlation. The heatmap presents correlations by colour code, ranging from blue (negative association) to red (positive correlation). The network depicts genes as nodes, positive correlations by yellow edges and negative correlations by blue edges. The heatmap and the network analysis showed two distinct, highly correlating gene clusters, representing genes with high expression in activated or non-activated T cells, respectively.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="srep38178-f7"/></fig><table-wrap position="float" id="t1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Overview of graphical and statistical methods provided by GMine.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">Clustering</th><th rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" charoff="50">Description</th></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">Method</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">Network analysis</td><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">Network of correlating features</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">PCoA, PCA, DCA, NMDS</td><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">Unsupervised ordination methods used for data clustering and the identification of outliers</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">LLE, t-SNE</td><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">Non-linear methods for dimensionality reduction used to present data in a two dimensional plot</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">Heatmaps</td><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">Heatmap of measurements.
