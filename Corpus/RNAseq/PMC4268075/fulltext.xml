Elevated levels of the serine protease inhibitors SERPINB3 and SERPINB4 are seen in patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. However their mechanistic role in the skin is unknown. To evaluate the contribution of Serpinb3a (mouse homolog of SERPINB3 and SERPINB4) in atopic dermatitis, we examined the effect of topical <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> extract exposure in wild-type and Serpinb3a null mice on transepidermal water loss (TEWL), sensitization and inflammation. Allergen exposure induced Serpinb3a expression in the skin, along with increased TEWL, epidermal thickness, and skin inflammation, all of which were attenuated in the absence of Serpinb3a. Attenuated TEWL correlated with decreased expression of the pro-inflammatory marker S100A8. Silencing of SERPINB3/B4 in human keratinocytes decreased S100A8 expression supporting a role for SERPINB3/B4 in initiation of the acute inflammatory response. RNA-Seq analysis following allergen exposure identified a network of pro-inflammatory genes induced in the wild type mice that was absent in the Serpinb3a null mice. In conclusion, Serpinb3a deficiency attenuates barrier dysfunction and the early inflammatory response following cutaneous allergen exposure, supporting a role for Serpinb3a (mice) and SERPINB3/B4 (humans) early in atopic dermatitis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Atopic dermatitis</kwd><kwd>SERPINB3/B4</kwd><kwd>Serpinb3a</kwd><kwd>TEWL</kwd><kwd>S100A8</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The importance of protease function in maintaining skin architecture and regulating responses to pathogens and allergens is well established (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Cork <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).

Thus, there is considerable evidence implicating SERPINB3/B4 in skin inflammation. However the role of these proteins in AD has yet to be defined.</p><p id="P3">We utilized Serpinb3a (mouse homolog of SERPINB3/B4) knockout mice that we have previously described (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Sivaprasad <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) to directly examine the role of SERPINB3/B4 in mouse models of AD following mold exposure. We examined early and late effects of exposure to <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> extract. Serpinb3a KO mice had attenuated inflammatory phenotypes associated with less transepidermal water loss (TEWL) compared to their wild type counterparts. Furthermore, SERPINB3/B4 downregulation in human keratinocytes was associated with markedly attenuated expression of S100A8, a marker of early inflammation, implicating SERPINB3/B4 in initiating early inflammatory events that lead to chronic skin conditions like AD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Serpinb3a is not required for the development of chronic atopic dermatitis</title><p id="P4">TEWL is a well-established measure of skin barrier function (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Gupta <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Sivaprasad <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>) and elevated TEWL is a hallmark of atopic dermatitis (AD) in children. Following repeated cutaneous exposure to <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> extract using the more chronic conventional model (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), wild type Balb/c (WT) and Serpinb3a null (KO) mice exhibited no differences in barrier function as assessed by TEWL at baseline.

Together, the data indicate that the absence of Serpinb3a does not impact the development of an AD-like response in mice following allergen exposure over several weeks.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Serpinb3a contributes to barrier dysfunction early after allergen exposure</title><p id="P5">In asthma, SERPINB3/B4 expression is increased during an acute exacerbation (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Guajardo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).

In wound exudates, SERPINB4 levels are higher in non-healing wounds compared to healing wounds (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Eming <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). This led us to speculate that the role of SERPINB3/B4 (or their mouse homolog) is likely to be part of the acute response rather than a chronic effect. To address this, we used a shorter model of cutaneous allergen exposure (three patches, each applied for 3 days, with a 24 hour rest period after each; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). In this model, TEWL was increased in WT mice exposed to ASP compared to saline (SAL) treated mice. This was significantly attenuated in the Serpinb3a KO mice treated with ASP after both the second and third patches (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B, C</xref>). The skin was visually evaluated and skin scores were assigned based on redness, skin thickening, and excoriations. Skin scores were increased following cutaneous ASP exposure in the WT mice, but were markedly attenuated in the Serpinb3a KO mice (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Consistent with the TEWL and the skin scores, epidermal thickness was increased following cutaneous ASP exposure in the WT mice, but was at only slightly elevated (close to saline treatment) in the Serpinb3a KO mice (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).

To identify very early changes caused by Serpinb3a, we used RNAseq followed by Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) to study global changes in gene expression in WT and Serpinb3a KO mice following a single application of allergen. For both genotypes, we identified genes whose expression was significantly induced or repressed in the ASP treated group compared to SAL controls, filtered the lists to those with a 2.5 fold or greater change (increase or decrease), and performed IPA analysis independently for the WT and KO mice. In the WT mice, the primary network of genes regulated by ASP identified by IPA was related to hematological system development and function, tissue morphology, and cellular movement. This included upregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, EBI3) and chemokines (CXCL13, CCL24, CCL25), downregulation of an inhibitor of T cell apoptosis (NR4A1) , and differential expression of regulators of development and differentiation (CTLA2&#x003b1;, INHBB, CSDC2, ALPNR), and metabolism (KHK, NR1H4) (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). IPA analysis also identified inflammation and immune responses as the key processes affected in the WT mice following allergen exposure. When we examined expression of the genes in this same network in the Serpinb3a KO mice, only a small fraction were differentially expressed (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table I</xref>).</p><p id="P12">In contrast, the primary network identified by IPA in the Serpinb3a KO mice included genes regulating cell morphology, cellular assembly and organization, and cellular development. They contained genes that regulate or are regulated by MAPK, PI3K, NF&#x003ba;B, or AKT signaling pathways (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>) that have all been implicated in mediating allergic responses (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Choi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Sharon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). These include genes that regulate T cell survival and signaling (TNFSF18, DAPP1), B cell survival (TNFSF13C), neutrophil infiltration and activation (TRPM2, IL24), along with a variety of genes involved in development (LAMA1, GDNF, GCM1, EFNB1, THPO, TAS1R1, EFNA1, CALR) and cell cycle (CCNE1, NCAPD2). It is important to highlight that expression of most of the pro-inflammatory genes is downregulated in the absence of Serpinb3a. Since the differences in expression of signaling pathway proteins was observed after a single patch of allergen, this observation, combined with the increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes in the WT mice supports a role for Serpinb3a in early inflammatory responses in the skin following allergen exposure.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S10"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P13">In this study, using an approach that integrates mouse models of atopic dermatitis and <italic>in vitro</italic> knockdown studies in human keratinocytes with analysis of human disease expression data, we have identified a role for the serine protease inhibitor Serpinb3a following allergen exposure. Serpinb3a regulates expression of the pro-inflammatory gene S100A8, with a significant impact on barrier function as assessed by TEWL. Collectively, our data reveal that human SERPINB3/B4 (Serpinb3a in mice) contributes to the cutaneous inflammatory response during the pathogenesis of more chronic skin diseases.</p><p id="P14">In a mouse model of asthma, we have previously shown that Serpinb3a KO mice have attenuated AHR and goblet cell hyperplasia. In this model, there was very little impact of Serpinb3a on inflammation after 3 weeks of exposure to dust mite. However Serpinb3a deficient mice treated with IL-13 alone for one week showed attenuated inflammation in addition to attenuated AHR and mucus production (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Sivaprasad <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Similar to our current findings in the skin, these data suggest that Serpinb3a promotes inflammation early in the pathogenesis of allergic disease. With continued allergen exposure, AD developed even in the absence of Serpinb3a indicating that other compensatory pathways are activated to restore the full inflammatory response. This is further supported by our RNAseq data, which revealed that expression of genes in several pro-inflammatory signaling pathways induced early during allergic responses is attenuated in the absence of Serpinb3a, consistent with attenuated skin inflammation phenotype. SERPINB3/B4 has been implicated in these pro-inflammatory responses previously. Transfection of human epidermal keratinocytes with SERPINB4 was sufficient to induce expression of IL-1alpha (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Titapiwatanakun <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), which is known to induce expression of S100A8/A9 in a p38 MAPK dependent manner (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Bando <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Our microarray data did not detect increased expression of S100A8 in the WT mice. This is likely because the time point chosen for the RNAseq (with a view to identifying very early changes that drive the decreased expression of S100A8) was too short to see any induction.</p><p id="P15">The role of IL-4 in regulating TEWL and barrier function has been well established (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Brandt and Sivaprasad, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Sehra <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Our RNAseq data in the WT mice also suggest that the more robust increase in TEWL in the WT mice is driven by an early increase in pro-TH2 responses.</p><p id="P16">Numerous studies have shown that SERPINB3/B4 protect cells from apoptosis in response to various triggers (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">de Koning <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Katagiri <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Murakami <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Song <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Suminami <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). None of our studies, either <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic>, have identified an obvious impact on apoptosis in the absence of Serpinb3a/SERPINB3/B4. One explanation is that ASP extract may not induce similar responses as DNA damaging triggers (UV, gamma radiation), or TNF&#x003b1;. SERPINB3 has been shown to have a protective effect in lysosomal injury-induced necrosis and an enhancing effect on ER stress-induced apoptosis (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Ullman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). How exactly these SERPINB3 regulated processes contribute to the development and/or persistence of AD remains to be evaluated.</p><p id="P17">Examination of the RNAseq data for mechanistic explanation provides few answers. IL-24 is known to increase skin inflammation induced by TNF in the absence of NF&#x003ba;B activity (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Kumari <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). TRPM2 is a Ca2+ permeable cation channel that is required for T cell proliferation and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion as well as other phenotypes in an experimental model of autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). It would be interesting to speculate that downregulation of one or both of these molecules could explain the attenuated inflammation in the absence of Serpinb3a. However the relevance of these findings remains to be established.</p><p id="P18">Serine proteases are important regulators of the balance between basal cell proliferation and desquamation to form the stratum corneum of the skin (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Cork <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). One possible role for Serpinb3a in the skin is to modulate the function of one of the proteases involved in this process. Thus, it was surprising to us that the deletion of a serine protease inhibitor (implying increased serine protease activity in the skin) did not result in an exacerbation of the disease phenotype. In our studies, histological comparison of skin sections of WT and Serpinb3a null mice revealed no significant differences in gross skin architecture, however, subtle differences in epidermal structure cannot be excluded.</p><p id="P19">Recent genetic studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SERPINB3/B4. A single nucleotide polymorphism in SERPINB3 that increased the protease inhibitory function of the protein was associated with liver cirrhosis (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Turato <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Another study identified a functional SNP in the SERPINB3 promoter associated with skin prick test positivity in asthmatic children that impacted binding of the transcription factors GATA2 and GATA3 after IL-4 and IL-13 treatment (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Karaaslan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). The impact of increased expression or activity of a protease inhibitor resulting in worse disease would suggest that the serine protease targeted by SERPINB3 would serve an anti-inflammatory role in the skin. This hypothesis is consistent with our finding of attenuated inflammation in the skin following depletion of Serpinb3a. Studies in our laboratory are currently ongoing to determine the association of SNPs in the SERPINB3/B4 locus with atopic dermatitis.</p><p id="P20">Current treatments for atopic dermatitis are focused mostly on skin hydration and topical corticosteroids. Better understanding of the molecular basis for skin inflammation will facilitate new drug development (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Schakel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Our studies have identified one such pathway, driven by SERPINB3/B4. It is tempting to speculate that early intervention with treatment that attenuates SERPINB3/B4 expression or activity may be beneficial for primary prevention, attenuation, or delayed onset of chronic skin diseases like AD. This pathway might also serve as an important predictor of the natural history of AD. Alternatively, studies could examine the contribution of this pathway to sensitivity to the number and/or type of AD triggers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S11"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Mice</title><p id="P21">Serpinb3a null mice (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Sivaprasad <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) and BALB/c mice (Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) were kept in a pathogen-free environment.
