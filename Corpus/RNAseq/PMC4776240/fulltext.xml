The fire belly salamander and sodefrin have become a model for sex pheromone investigation in aquatically courting salamanders ever since. Subsequent studies in other salamanders identified SPF protein courtship pheromones of around 20&#x02009;kDa belonging to the same gene-family. Although transcripts of these proteins could be PCR-amplified in <italic>Cynops</italic>, it is currently unknown whether they effectively use full-length SPF pheromones next to sodefrin. Here we combined transcriptomics, proteomics and phylogenetics to investigate SPF pheromone use in <italic>Cynops pyrrhogaster.</italic> Our data show that not sodefrin transcripts, but multiple SPF transcripts make up the majority of the expression profile in the dorsal gland of this newt. Proteome analyses of water in which a male has been courting confirm that this protein blend is effectively secreted and tail-fanned to the female. By combining phylogenetics and expression data, we show that independent evolutionary lineages of these SPF&#x02019;s were already expressed in ancestral <italic>Cynops</italic> species before the origin of sodefrin.

Males of this species use an elaborate courtship display to tail-fan the pheromones produced in these glands via their cloaca to the female (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">movie S1</xref>).

Interestingly, in addition to the family-specific Plethodontid Modulating Factor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and Plethodontid Receptivity Factor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, these studies revealed protein precursors that are largely similar to sodefrin precursors and were termed Sodefrin Precursor-like Factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> (SPF, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). The sodefrin decapeptide and SPF protein pheromones are thus derived from the same gene family, here referred to as the SPF-family (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> for consistency in use of terminology in this paper). Behavioural tests with isolated SPF proteins in both lungless salamanders (Plethodontidae) and newts (Salamandridae) have demonstrated that they function as courtship pheromones that enhance female receptivity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Recent studies on the expression and evolution of SPF-family transcripts in cloacal glands of Salamandridae showed that, compared to SPF transcripts, sodefrin transcripts contain an extra 62 basepair insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, insert indicated in black)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. This causes a frameshift in protein translation and generates a sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, indicated in dark and light green) from which the decapeptide pheromone can be cleaved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, indicated in dark green). The frameshift originated in an ancestral <italic>Cynops</italic> lineage, indicating that it is not present in other salamanders, and that sodefrin and its variants are likely restricted to the <italic>Cynops</italic> lineage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Because the newly generated sodefrin peptide has no sequence homology with existing salamander SPF protein pheromones, this decapeptide represents an interesting case of the birth of a new pheromone<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.</p><p>The urodelan SPF pheromone family is a complex one in which gene duplications have been very common<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. The first duplication, already in the Late Palaeozoic, denotes the onset of diversification and gave rise to two SPF lineages that were termed alpha and beta<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Today&#x02019;s descendant alpha and beta transcripts encode protein pheromones that are still secreted by courting male palmate newts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Although SPF transcripts have been PCR-amplified in the genus <italic>Cynops</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, information on effective translation, precursor abundance, and release of these proteins into the water during courtship is inexistent. As a consequence, it is currently unknown whether <italic>Cynops</italic> species actively use full length SPF pheromones next to sodefrin, or whether the decapeptide has replaced the function of SPF in this genus.</p><p>Here we studied the use of SPF proteins during courtship in <italic>Cynops pyrrhogaster</italic>. We first performed RNA-Seq transcriptome analyses of the male pheromone-producing dorsal gland to study the significance of SPF with regard to sodefrin transcript expression in this species. To validate these results, we also performed proteome analyses of water in which a male Japanese fire belly newt had been tail fanning, and demonstrate that multiple SPF proteins are effectively secreted and tail-fanned to the female during courtship (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">movie S1</xref>). Finally, we combined a phylogeny of SPF-family transcripts with our transcriptome and proteome data to show that both alpha and beta SPF &#x02018;s were already effectively secreted in water before the origin of the peptide sodefrin.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>SPF transcripts are highly expressed in the male dorsal glands</title><p>To identify the SPF and sodefrin transcripts in the pheromone-producing dorsal gland of male <italic>Cynops pyrrhogaster</italic>, we performed RACE-PCR with a broad spectrum of primers designed on conserved regions of known SPF-family transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S1</xref>). Obtained sequences were assembled in 99% contiguous sequences (contigs), which resulted in 25 cDNA sequences. (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, GenBank numbers KU213615-KU213639). Two of these were identified as sodefrin transcripts by the presence of the typical 62&#x02009;bp nucleotide insert (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, CyPy_SPF_3 and 5), while all others are SPF transcripts. Translated sequences displayed up to 80% pairwise divergence, similar to the diversity found in the palmate newt<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p><p>To further investigate the relative expression of sodefrin and SPF transcripts, we performed complete transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) of the dorsal gland. This yielded 101.402.858 reads, together constituting 5.2 Giga bases (Gb). Expression analyses resulted in mapping of 17,607,281 of these reads on the transcripts that were obtained by RACE PCR, indicating that at least 17.4% of the total RNA-Seq reads of the dorsal gland belong to the SPF-family. From this subset of reads, 15.2% of the expression could be attributed to the sodefrin transcripts. Investigation of the read mappings showed a relatively uniform distribution (including over the 62&#x02009;bp insert range) with few aspecific reads, confirming that the expression level of these sodefrin transcripts is a realistic estimate. Uncleaved alpha and beta SPF transcripts accounted for 42.8% and 42% of the SPF-family expression in the dorsal gland, respectively. Our analyses therefore indicate that during the breeding period, SPF transcripts comprise the majority (84.8%) of expression of the SPF-family in the male dorsal gland in <italic>Cynops pyrrhogaster</italic>, indicating that sodefrin transcripts are expressed against this strong background.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Proteome analyses show high congruence with transcriptome expression data</title><p>To verify that the RNA-Seq expression data reflect the SPF proteins that are effectively secreted during courtship, we isolated and purified molecules directly from water in which male newts had been courting a female. To account for individual variation, we pooled water of 10 courting couples in which at least five minutes of male tail-fanning occurred. The RP-HPLC chromatogram revealed the presence of several proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>) that are absent in water of non-courting couples (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the fractions of interest showed the presence of multiple proteins around 20&#x02013;25&#x02009;kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>), and subsequent Edman degradation of the proteins in these fractions confirmed that they are indeed members of the SPF family (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S2</xref>).</p><p>The N-terminal sequence already indicates that proteins eluting around minutes 69&#x02013;81 belong to the beta SPF group, while proteins present in the two peaks around minutes 85&#x02013;100 belong to the alpha SPF group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Mass spectrometry measurements indicate that these proteins are glycosylated (not shown), which is similar to SPF&#x02019;s in palmate newts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, and in line with our <italic>Cynops</italic> precursors showing several potential N-glycosylation sites. To link the proteins from courtship water to our transcripts from the dorsal gland, we aligned a data set combining the amino acid sequences obtained by Edman sequencing (10 to 30 amino acids, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) with our translated transcripts, and estimated the pairwise similarities. The distance tree shows that the Edman sequences correspond to the transcripts that were identified as the most abundant in our RNA expression analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p>Since earlier studies (e.g.)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, have intensively focussed on recovering cleaved fragments of sodefrin precursors (i.e. sodefrin and peptide variants), our analyses particularly focussed on identifying full-length SPF proteins from courtship water. However, it is noteworthy mentioning that we retrieved a protein (&#x0003c;10&#x02009;kDa) from courtship water (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>, fractions 71&#x02013;73), which was cleaved from a sodefrin precursor at a lysine-arginine cleavage site. This indicates that, in addition to the decapeptide, other fragments of sodefrin precursors also end up in the water and have the potential of being sensed by a female. Altogether, our data show a high congruence between transcriptome and proteome, indicating that RNA-Seq expression data are a reliable representation of SPF proteins that are effectively tail-fanned from a male to a female during courtship.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Both alpha and beta SPF&#x02019;s were expressed at the origin of sodefrin</title><p>To investigate the phylogenetic position of SPF-family transcripts of <italic>Cynops</italic> in relation to other known SPF&#x02019;s, we combined our translated transcripts (full coding sequence) with data from Ambystomatidae<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, Plethodontidae<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> and other Salamandridae<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Alignment resulted in a data matrix of 95 OTUs and 225 characters, for which ProtTest<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> assigned JTT&#x02009;+&#x02009;G as the best fitting model under the AIC criterion. Subsequent Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian analyses (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>) in combination with Notung analyses resulted in a gene tree that is highly congruent with previously published relationships among SPF precursor sequences<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). The earliest split is formed by the divergence of two supported clades corresponding to alpha and beta SPF protein precursors, whose divergence has been estimated around the Late Paleozoic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p><p>Our tree and associated support values show that currently expressed <italic>C. pyrrhogaster</italic> SPF-family precursors belong to seven independent lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>: A&#x02013;G). Six of these lineages exclusively contain SPF precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>; A&#x02013;C,E&#x02013;G), while a single clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>; D) combines SPF and sodefrin precursors. Since grouping of any of these lineages would require violating strongly supported nodes in our tree, our analyses indicate that all of these lineages must have originated through gene duplications before the divergence of Asian salamanders (including <italic>Cynops</italic>) from European salamanders (including <italic>Lissotriton</italic> and <italic>Ichthyosaura</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Because the origin of sodefrin happened in an ancestor of <italic>Cynops</italic> after the divergence of these clades<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, this indicates that these seven lineages of SPF proteins were existent in <italic>Cynops</italic> at the time of sodefrin origin.</p><p>Four lineages currently make up about 95% of the expression of the SPF pheromone family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>, A&#x02013;D). First, the closely related precursors in clade A, together accounting for 44.3% of the expression, belong to a strongly supported alpha clade of SPF proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). These proteins fall in a clade that contains a highly expressed <italic>Lissotriton helveticus</italic> SPF (LiHe 003: see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>, indicated with *) for which behavioural assays have shown a courtship pheromone function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Furthermore, salamandrid SPF precursors in this clade are orthologous with the main SPF courtship pheromones from the mental gland of plethodontids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>, indicated with #)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Altogether, this suggests that alpha SPF&#x02019;s have continued to play an important role in the courtship behaviour throughout the evolution of internally fertilizing salamanders. Second, the beta-SPF lineages B, C and D account for more than half (50.3%) of the cumulative expression in our RNA-Seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>), with sodefrin precursors making up the majority of expression in group D (15.2%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). In contrast to the alpha precursors, <italic>Lissotriton</italic> orthologs are either absent (lineage B) or only show low expression (lineage C: LiHe 009, 023, 012, 018, 013 lineage D: LiHe 021 &#x00026; 032) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S3</xref>), while we found no <italic>C. pyrrhogaster</italic> orthologs in the clade that shows the highest expression in <italic>Lissotriton</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>, LiHe 001, 002 and 003, clade of Pleurodelinae indicated with an arrow). Additional BLAST searches for <italic>L. helveticus</italic> orthologs in <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies of our <italic>Cynops</italic> RNA-Seq data only resulted in hits with other SPF precursor clades, confirming that fire belly newts currently make no use of these SPF proteins in courtship. Since the use of multiple individuals for our protein analyses significantly reduces the possibility that the observed expression data are biased by individual variation, our joint analyses suggest that expression shifts between different beta SPF clades have occurred after the divergence of European and Asian newts. In addition to sequence evolution, expression shifts are an alternative way of obtaining species-specificity of pheromone blends in multi-component peptide and protein pheromone systems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Since no expression data are available for newt species that diverged before the <italic>Cynops</italic>-<italic>Lissotriton</italic> split, our data currently do not allow estimating individual transcript abundance in their common ancestor. However, they do support that beta protein pheromones were expressed in the ancestor of <italic>Cynops</italic>, and thus were also present at the timing of the origin of sodefrin. Our combined results thus indicate that <italic>Cynops pyrrhogaster</italic> already effectively secreted both alpha and beta proteins before the origin of sodefrin.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Despite the fact that sodefrin in the Japanese fire belly newt has served as a model for newt pheromone research since its discovery, the alongside secretion of multiple uncleaved SPF proteins has remained undetected for a long time. Our combined transcriptomic, proteomic and phylogenetic approaches show that this species secretes multiple uncleaved SPF proteins that make up the majority (about 85%) of expression in the SPF pheromone family, and that ancestral forms of both alpha and beta SPF&#x02019;s were already expressed at the time of sodefrin origin. Because these SPF&#x02019;s likely continued to perform their pheromone function, the newly originated decapeptide sodefrin could be preserved, even without immediately acquiring a biological function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.

Furthermore, several other fragments ending up in the water after cleavage from sodefrin precursors, some of which still showing homology with SPF&#x02019;s, have not been tested in behavioural assays that would allow demonstrating a courtship pheromone role. Such tests will be indispensable for a complete understanding of how this multi-component courtship pheromone system originated and evolved.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ethics statement</title><p><italic>C. pyrrhogaster</italic> individuals (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;21) were purchased from a local pet shop (Squama, Herent, Belgium).

The following PCR conditions were used: one initial denaturation for 240&#x02009;s at 94&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, followed by 36 cycles with denaturation for 40&#x02009;s at 94&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, annealing for 60&#x02009;s at different temperatures, and elongation for 60&#x02009;s at 72&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. To clone these amplification products, we used a pGEM-T Easy cloning vector (Promega). Vectors were transformed into TOP10 Competent Cells (Invitrogen). Colonies were picked randomly and inserts were amplified with Faststart Taq DNA polymerase using the same above-mentioned conditions. Amplification products (96 in total) were purified and sequenced, and sequence editing was performed with CodonCode Aligner version 3.7.1.1. Contigs were constructed with 99% identical bases and translated into amino acid sequences.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Proteome analyses</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Collection of proteins from courtship water</title><p>Pheromone collection was done by placing a male and female for 1&#x02009;h in a plastic container (25&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;16&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;14&#x02009;cm) filled with 600&#x02009;ml of ultrapure water (Milli Q, Millipore, Billerica, MA). During sampling, couples were monitored for courtship behaviour and the amount of time a male fanned his tail was measured. We retained water of 10 courting couples in which at least five minutes of male tail-fanning occurred and in which the female followed the courting male, indicating the presence of pheromones (henceforth termed courtship water). Pheromones were extracted by applying courtship water of a single couple onto two separate solid phase extraction cartridges (RP-C8 and RP-C18 Sep-Pak plus cartridge, 400&#x02009;mg sorbent, Waters, Milford, MA, USA) using a vacuum pump. As a negative control, this procedure was repeated for 10 non-courting couples that had spent the same amount of time in water as the 10 courting couples. Proteins were eluted from the cartridges with 90% (v/v) acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). All acetonitrile was evaporated using a SpeedVac concentrator (SCV-100&#x02009;H, Savant instruments, Farmingdale, NY). After concentration, samples were pooled and subjected to reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) for additional purification</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Purification of proteins from courtship water using RP-HPLC</title><p>Peptides and proteins were purified using RP-HPLC. After collecting the molecules, pooled and concentrated samples (see above) were loaded onto a Source 5RPC column (4.6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;150&#x02009;mm, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden) pre-equilibrated with 0.1% (v/v) TFA (A). After loading, the column was washed for 10&#x02009;minutes at a constant flow rate of 1&#x02009;ml/min using the same solvent. Proteins were eluted with 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA (B) by applying following gradient: from 0&#x02013;65% B in 104&#x02009;minutes and from 65&#x02013;100% B in 10&#x02009;minutes, at 1&#x02009;ml/min. Detection of eluting proteins was performed at a wavelength of 214&#x02009;nm and the eluate was collected in fractions of 1&#x02009;ml. Fractions of interest were subjected to non-reducing SDS-PAGE using precast gels (Any kD Mini-PROTEAN TGX, Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA).

Bayesian analyses were conducted using a mixed prior for the AA substitution model and gamma correction for among-site rate heterogeneity. Two runs of four Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains each were executed in parallel for 10,000,000 generations, with a sampling interval of 1,000 generations. Convergence of the parallel runs was confirmed by split frequency standard deviations (&#x0003c;0.01) and potential scale reduction factors (approximating 1.0) for all model parameters, as reported by MrBayes. Adequate posterior sampling was verified using Tracer 1.6<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, by checking if the runs had reached effective sampling sizes&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;200 for all model parameters. A Bayesian consensus phylogram and Bayesian posterior probabilities (BPP) were inferred from the last 5,000 sampled trees of both runs.

The major difference is that sodefrin RNA transcripts contain a 62 base pair insert (indicated in black) that causes a translational frame shift at the C-terminal end of the protein (indicated in light&#x02009;+&#x02009;dark green). This leads to the origin of cleavage sites (indicated with green arrows) that allow generating the decapeptide sodefrin (indicated in dark green). SPF transcripts do not have such an insert, and become expressed as full-length proteins. The pheromones that result from each precursor type therefore show no amino acid sequence similarity.
