Numerous variants of unknown significance (VUS) in both coding and non-coding gene regions cannot be categorized with these approaches. To address these limitations,
<italic>in silico</italic> methods that predict biological impact of individual sequence variants on protein coding and gene expression have been developed, which exhibit varying degrees of sensitivity and specificity
<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. These approaches have generally not been capable of objective, efficient variant analysis on a genome-scale.</p><p>Splicing variants, in particular, are known to be a significant cause of human disease
<sup><xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and indeed have even been hypothesized to be the most frequent cause of hereditary disease
<sup><xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Computational identification of mRNA splicing mutations within DNA sequencing (DNA-Seq) data has been implemented to varying degrees of sensitivity, with most software only evaluating conservation solely at the intronic dinucleotides adjacent to the junction (i.e.
<sup><xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>). Other approaches are capable of detecting significant mutations at other positions with constitutive, and in certain instances, cryptic, splice sites
<sup><xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> which can result in aberrations in mRNA splicing. Presently, only information theory-based mRNA splicing mutation analysis has been implemented on a genome scale
<sup><xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Splicing mutations can abrogate recognition of natural, constitutive splice sites (inactivating mutation), weaken their binding affinity (leaky mutation), or alter splicing regulatory protein binding sites that participate in exon definition. The abnormal molecular phenotypes of these mutations comprise: (a) complete exon skipping, (b) reduced efficiency of splicing, (c) failure to remove introns (also termed intron retention or intron inclusion), or (d) cryptic splice site activation, which may define abnormal exon boundaries in transcripts using non-constitutive, proximate sequences, extending or truncating the exon. Some mutations may result in combinations of these molecular phenotypes. Nevertheless, novel or strengthened cryptic sites can be activated independently of any direct effect on the corresponding natural splice site. The prevalence of these splicing events has been determined by ourselves and others
<sup><xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. The diversity of possible molecular phenotypes makes such aberrant splicing challenging to corroborate at the scale required for complete genome (or exome) analyses. This has motivated the development of statistically robust algorithms and software to comprehensively validate the predicted outcomes of splicing mutation analysis.</p><p>Putative splicing variants require empirical confirmation based on expression studies from appropriate tissues carrying the mutation, compared with control samples lacking the mutation. In mutations identified from complete genome or exome sequences, corresponding transcriptome analysis based on RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is performed to corroborate variants predicted to alter splicing. Manually inspecting a large set of splicing variants of interest with reference to the experimental samples&#x02019; RNA-Seq data in a program like the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)
<sup><xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, or simply performing database searches to find existing evidence would be time-consuming for large-scale analyses. Checking control samples would be required to ensure that the variant is not a result of alternative splicing, but is actually causally linked to the variant of interest. Manual inspection of the number of control samples required for statistical power to verify that each displays normal splicing would be laborious and does not easily lend itself to statistical analyses. This may lead to either missing contradictory evidence or to discarding a variant due to the perceived observation of statistically insignificant altered splicing within control samples. In addition, a list of putative splicing variants returned by variant prediction software can often be extremely large. The validation of such a significant quantity of variants may not be feasible, for example, in certain types of cancer, in instances where the genomic mutational load is high and only manual annotation is performed. We have therefore developed Veridical, a software program that automatically searches all given experimental and control RNA-Seq data to validate DNA-derived splicing variants. When adequate expression data are available at the locus carrying the mutation, this approach reveals a comprehensive set of genes exhibiting mRNA splicing defects in complete genomes and exomes. Veridical and its associated software programs are available at:
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.veridical.org">www.veridical.org</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The program Veridical was developed to allow high-throughput validation of predicted splicing mutations using RNA sequencing data. Veridical requires at least three files to operate: a DNA variant file containing putative mRNA splicing mutations, a file listing of corresponding transcriptome (RNA-Seq) BAM files, and a file annotating exome structure. A separate file listing RNA-Seq BAM files for control samples (i.e. normal tissue) can also be provided. Here, we demonstrate the capabilities of the software for mutations predicted in a set of breast tumours. Veridical compares RNA-Seq data from the same tumours with RNA-Seq data from control samples lacking the predicted mutation. However, in principle, potential splicing mutations for any disease state with available RNA-Seq data can be investigated. In each tumour, every variant is analyzed by checking the informative sequencing reads from the corresponding RNA-Seq experiment for non-constitutive splice isoforms, and comparing these results with the same type of data from all other tumour and normal samples that do not carry the variant in their exomes.</p><p>Veridical concomitantly evaluates control samples, providing for an unbiased assessment of splicing variants of potentially diverse phenotypic consequences. Note that control samples include all non-variant containing files (i.e. RNA-Seq files for those tumours without the variant of interest), as well any normal samples provided. Increasing the number of the set of control samples, while computationally more expensive, increases the statistical robustness of the results obtained.</p><p>For each variant, Veridical directly analyzes sequence reads aligned to the exons and introns that are predicted to be affected by the genomic variant. We elected to avoid indirect measures of exon skipping, such as loss of heterozygosity in the transcript, because of the possibility of confusion with other molecular etiologies (i.e. deletion or gene conversion), unrelated to the splicing mutations. The nearest natural site is found using the exome annotation file provided, based upon the directionality of the variant, as defined within
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. The genomic coordinates of the neighboring exon boundaries are then found and the program proceeds, iterating over all known transcript variants for the given gene. A diagram of this procedure is provided in

<sup><xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> to iterate over all of the reads within a given genomic region across experimental and control samples. Individual reads are then assessed for their corroborating value towards the analysis of the variant being processed, as outlined in the flowchart in
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>. Validating reads are based on whether they alter either the location of the splice junction (i.e. junction-spanning) or the abundance of the transcript, particularly in intronic regions (i.e. read-abundance). Junction-spanning reads contain DNA sequences from two adjacent exons or are reads that extend into the intron (
<xref ref-type="other" rid="e1a">Equation 1(e)</xref>). These reads directly show whether the intronic sequence is removed or retained by the spliceosome, respectively. Read-abundance validated reads are based upon sequences predicted to be found in the mutated transcript in comparison with sequences that are expected to be excised from the mature transcript in the absence of a mutation (
<xref ref-type="other" rid="e1f">Equation 1(f)</xref>). Both types of reads can be used to validate cryptic splicing, exon skipping, or intron inclusion. A read is said to corroborate cryptic splicing if and only if the variant under consideration is expected to activate cryptic splicing. Junction-spanning, cryptic splicing reads are those in which a read is exactly split from the cryptic splice site to the adjacent exon junction (
<xref ref-type="other" rid="e1a">Equation 1(a)</xref>). For read-abundance cryptic splicing, we define the concept of a read fraction, which is the ratio of the number of reads corroborating the cryptically spliced isoform and the number of reads that do not support the use of the cryptic splice site (i.e. non-cryptic corroborating) in the same genomic region of a sample. Cryptic corroborating reads are those which occur within the expected region where cryptic splicing occurs (i.e. spliced-in regions). This region is bounded by the variant splice site location and the adjacent (direction dependent) splice junction (
<xref ref-type="other" rid="e1a">Equation 1(a)</xref>). Non-cryptic corroborating reads, which we also term &#x0201c;anti-cryptic&#x0201d; reads, are those that do not lie within this region, but would still be retained within the portion that would be excised, had cryptic splicing occurred (
<xref ref-type="other" rid="e1b">Equation 1(b)</xref>). To identify instances of exon skipping, Veridical only employs junction-spanning reads. A read is considered to corroborate exon skipping if the connecting read segments are split such that it connects two exon boundaries, skipping an exon in between (
<xref ref-type="other" rid="e1c">Equation 1(c)</xref>). A read is considered to corroborate intron inclusion when the read is continuous and either overlaps with the intron-exon boundary (and is then said to be junction-spanning) or if the read is within an intron (and is then said to be based upon read-abundance). We only consider an intron inclusion read to be junction spanning if it spans the relevant splice junction,
<italic>A</italic>.
<xref ref-type="other" rid="e1d">Equation 1(d)</xref> formalizes this concept. We occasionally use the term &#x0201c;total intron inclusion&#x0201d; to denote that any such count of intron inclusion reads includes both those containing and not containing the mutation itself.

P-values are shown in parentheses within the experimental table, which refer to the column-dependent (i.e. the read type is given in the column header) p-value for that read type with respect to that same read type in control samples. The program produces three files: a log file containing all details regarding validated variants, an output file with the programs progress reports and summaries, and a filtered validated variant file. The filtered file contains all validated variants of statistical significance (set as

<sup><xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> or Ensembl
<sup><xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. The large number of transcript variants within Ensembl, in particular, caused many spurious intron inclusion validation events. This occurred because reads were found to be intronic in many cases, when in actuality they were exonic with respect to the more common transcript variant. In addition, the inclusion of the large number of rare transcripts in Ensembl significantly increased program run-time and made validation events much more challenging to interpret unequivocally. The use of RefSeq, which is a conservative annotation of the human exome, resolves these issues. It is possible that some subset of unknown or Ensemble annotated intronic transcripts could be sufficiently prevalent to merit inclusion in our analysis. We do not attempt to perform the difficult task of deciding which of these transcripts would be worth using. Indeed, the task of confirming and annotating of such transcripts is already done by the more conservative annotation we employ.</p><p>We also provide an R program
<sup><xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> which produces publication quality histograms displaying embedded Q-Q plots and p-values, to evaluate for normality of the read distribution and statistical significance, respectively.

The program objectively evaluates each mutation with statistical tests that determine the likelihood of and exclude normal splicing. To our knowledge, no other software currently validates splicing mutations with RNA-Seq data on a genome-wide scale, although many applications can accurately detect conventional alternative splice isoforms (i.e.
<sup><xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>). Veridical is intended for use with large data sets derived from many samples, each containing several hundred variants that have been previously prioritized as likely splicing mutations, regardless of how the candidate mutations are selected. It is not practical to analyze all variants present in an exome or genome, rather only a filtered subset, due to the extensive computations required for statistical validation. As such, Veridical is a key component of an end-to-end, hypothesis-based, splicing mutation analysis framework that also includes the Shannon splicing mutation pipeline
<sup><xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and the Automated Splice Site Analysis and Exon Definition server
<sup><xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. There is a trade-off between lengthy run-times and statistical robustness of Veridical, especially when there are either a large number of variants or a large number of RNA-Seq files. As with most statistical methods, those employed here are not amenable to small sample sets, but become quite powerful when a large number of controls are employed. In order to ensure that mutations can be validated, we recommend an excess of control transcriptome data relative to those from samples containing mutations (&#x0003e; 5 : 1), guided by the power analysis
<xref ref-type="other" rid="m">described in Methods</xref>. We
<italic>do not</italic> recommend the use of a single nor a few control samples to corroborate a putative mutation. Not surprisingly, we have found that junction-spanning reads have the greatest value for corroborating cryptic splicing and exon skipping. Even a single such read is almost always sufficient to merit the validation of a variant, provided that sufficient control samples are used. For intron inclusion, both junction-spanning and read-abundance-based reads are useful and a variant can readily be validated with either, provided that the variant-containing experimental sample(s) show a statistically significant increase in the presence of either form of intron inclusion corroborating reads.</p><p>Veridical is able to automatically process variants from multiple different experimental samples, and can group the variant information if any given mutation is present in more than one sample. The use of a large sample size allows for robust statistical analyses to be performed, which aid significantly in the interpretation of results. The main utility of Veridical is to filter through large data sets of predicted splicing mutations to prioritize the variants. This helps to predict which variants will have a deleterious effect upon the protein product. Veridical is able to avoid reporting splicing changes that are naturally occurring through checking all variant-containing and non-containing control samples for the predicted splicing consequence. In addition, running multiple tumour samples at once allows for manual inspection to discover samples that contained the alternative splicing pattern, and consequently, permits the identification of DNA mutations in the same location which went undetected during genome sequencing.</p><p>The statistical power of Veridical is dependent upon the quality of the RNA-Seq data used to validate putative variants. In particular, a lack of sufficient coverage at a particular locus will cause Veridical to be unable to report any significant results. A coverage of at least 20 reads should be sufficient. This estimate is based upon alternative splicing analyses in which this threshold was found to imply concordance with microarray and RT-PCR measurements
<sup><xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. There are many potential legitimate reasons why a mutation may not be validated: (a) A lack of gene expression in the variant containing tumour sample, (b) nonsense-mediated decay may result in a loss of expression of the entire transcript, (c) the gene itself may have multiple paralogs and reads may not be unambiguously mapped, (d) other non-splicing mutations could account for a loss of expression, and (e) confounding natural alternative splicing isoforms may result in a loss of statistical significance during read mapping of the control samples. The prevalence of loci with insufficient data is dependent upon the coverage of the sequencing technology used. As sequencing technologies improve, the proportion of validated mutations is expected to increase. Such an increase would mirror that observed for the prevalence of alternative splicing events
<sup><xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. In addition, mutated splicing factors can disrupt splicing fidelity and exon definition
<sup><xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. This effect could decrease Veridical&#x02019;s ability to validate splicing mutations affected by a disruption of the definition of the pertinent exon. Veridical does not currently form any equivalence between distinct variants affecting the same splice site. Such variants will be analyzed independently. Veridical is intended to be used with RNA-Seq data that not only corresponds to matched DNA-Seq data, but also only for sets of samples with comparable sequencing protocols, since the non-normalized comparisons performed rely upon the evening out of batch effects, due to a substantial number of control samples. It is important to note that acceptance of the null hypothesis, due to an absence of evidence required to disprove it, does not imply that the underlying prediction of a mutation at a particular locus is incorrect, but merely that the current empirical methods employed were insufficient to corroborate it.</p><p>&#x0201c;Validate,&#x0201d; in the present context, refers to the condition where sufficient statistical evidence has been marshaled in support of a variant. However, the threshold for significance can vary so these analyses can also be thought of as strongly corroborating variants. Recent studies in Bayesian statistics have suggested that a p-value threshold of 0.05 does not correspond to strong support of the alternative hypothesis. Accordingly, Johnson
<sup><xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> recommends the use of tests at the 0.005 or 0.001 level of significance.</p><p>We consider alternative splicing to be a different problem. Veridical does not aim to identify putatively pathogenic variants, but rather,
<italic>to confirm</italic> existing
<italic>in silico</italic> predictions thereof. We do infer exon skipping events (i.e. alternative splicing)
<italic>de novo</italic>, but only to catalog dysregulated splicing &#x0201c;phenotypes&#x0201d; due to genomic sequence variants. This is not the first study to use a large control dataset. Indeed the Variant Annotation, Analysis &#x00026; Search Tool (VAAST)
<sup><xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> does this to search for disease-causing (non-splicing) variants and the Multivariate Analysis of Transcript Splicing (MATS)
<sup><xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> tool (among others) can be used for the discovery of alternative splicing events. However, in our case, in most instances the distribution of reads in a single sample is compared to the distributions of reads in the control set, as opposed to a likelihood framework-based approach. We are suggesting that our approach be coupled to existing approaches to act as an
<italic>a posteriori</italic>, hypothesis-driven, check on the veridicality of specific variants.</p><p>While there is considerable prior evidence for splicing mutations that alter natural and cryptic splice site recognition, we were somewhat surprised at the apparent high frequency of statistically significant intron inclusion revealed by Veridical. In fact, evidence indicates that a significant portion of the genome is transcribed
<sup><xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>, and it is estimated that 95% of known genes are alternatively spliced
<sup><xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. Defective mRNA splicing can lead to multiple alternative transcripts including those with retained introns, cassette exons, alternate promoters/terminators, extended or truncated exons, and reduced exons
<sup><xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. In breast cancer, exon skipping and intron retention were observed to be the most common form of alternative splicing in triple negative, non-triple negative, and HER2 positive breast cancer
<sup><xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. In normal tissue, intron retention and exon skipping has been predicted to affect 2572 exons in 2127 genes and 50 633 exons in 12 797 genes, respectively
<sup><xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. In addition, previous studies suggest that the order of intron removal can influence the final mRNA transcript composition of exons and introns
<sup><xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. Intron inclusion observed in normal tissue may result from those introns that are removed from the transcript at the end of mRNA splicing. Given that these splicing events are relatively common in normal tissues, it becomes all the more important to distinguish expression patterns that are clearly due to the effects of splicing mutations &#x02014; one of the guiding principles of the Veridical method.</p><p>Veridical is an important analytical resource for unsupervised, thorough validation of splicing mutations through the use of companion RNA-Seq data from the same samples. The approach will be broadly applicable for many types of genetic abnormalities, and should reveal numerous, previously unrecognized, mRNA splicing mutations in exome and complete genome sequences.</p></sec><sec><title>Data availability</title><p>figshare: Input, output, and explanatory files for Veridical,

In particular, all variants of interest should be concatenated into a single file. Once a, tab-delimited, concatenated file has been generated, it can easily be formatted correctly by using

One can also manually ensure the following: the header line has no quotation marks or special characters, empty columns have been replaced by a period (.) and each variant line contains only a single gene (comma-delimited gene lists must be split such that there is only one gene per line). If one wishes Veridical to consider variants pertaining to more than one experimental sample, a comma-delimited list of experimental samples, in the form of BAM file names, must be provided as the

While variants of the most conserved splice site nucleotides at the intron-exon boundary can be predicted to cause splice defects with high reliability, it remains difficult to predict whether variants deeper in the intron or those that potentially affect exonic splicing enhancers actually cause splice defects. RNA-seq data, when coupled with variant data, potentially provide a means of correlating variation data with observations of (mis-)splicing patterns.</p><p>&#x000a0;</p><p>The program fulfils an important need in the community, the results appear promising and will be of special interest to groups performing RNA-seq analysis in medical settings. I have only some minor suggestions that the authors may like to consider.</p><p>&#x000a0;</p><p>&#x000a0;</p><p>Suggestions:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The explanation of the methodology is relatively difficult to follow, and I wonder if it might not be better to simplify Figures 1 and 2 for didactic sake. For instance, in Figure 1A, it is unclear where the location of variant
<italic> C</italic> is. Does the curved line mean that it could be anywhere in the middle exon? &#x000a0;Also, I assume that exons are being shown in blue and reads shown in gray?&#x000a0;</p><p>Also, the legend text is overly complicated:
<italic>D</italic> &#x0003e;
<italic>E</italic> swap
<italic>D</italic> and
<italic>E</italic>. While aficionados of first order logic will follow without problems, I would suggest that it would be better for didactic purposes to delete this and to implicitly assume that
<italic>D</italic>&#x0003c;
<italic>E</italic> for the sake of this figure. Figure 1B is confusing at this point in the manuscript because the motivation for switching the variable
<italic>A</italic>,
<italic>B</italic>,
<italic>D</italic>, and
<italic>E</italic> is not yet clear. On the other hand, panel C and panel D are trivial and do not add anything. I would suggest using Figure 1 to provide one concrete example one a simple level, and stating in the text that the variables are to be switched if the candidate mutation is located on the other side of the exon.&#x000a0;</p><p>Also, the explanations of the method that are couched in first order logic-like notation are difficult to follow, because it is not stated whether the variant
<italic>C</italic> can precede the start of the read (in which case
<italic>C-S</italic> would be negative). The subscripts for
<italic>r</italic> in turn have the subscript s
<italic>1</italic> but the variable
<italic>S</italic> in the formula does not.&#x000a0;</p><p>Although in the end, I think I follow the overall method, the reader is forced to make arbitrary assumptions in order to interpret the formulae being used to explain the method. A similar comment pertains to the flow chart in Figure 2.</p><p>Therefore, I would suggest the authors take some pains to improve the clarity of the explanation of the method. I would suggest that they show one of two concrete examples and provide English language specifications of the FOL-like formulae that describe the partitioning of reads.</p><p>&#x000a0;</p></list-item><list-item><p>I am a little unclear on the use of control samples vs experimental samples.

</p><p>&#x000a0;</p></list-item><list-item><p>It would be prohibitively difficult for a user and cumbersome to attempt to add such support. The Shannon Pipeline and most other splicing analysis software accept variant call format (VCF) input and outputs their own custom format. VCF is very poorly suited for the annotation of detailed splicing information. The position of the variant is not necessarily the same as the affect splice junction coordinate. While it is possible to label the junction using custom fields in the VCF &#x0201c;INFO&#x0201d; column, the format is not standardized;&#x000a0;it would be specific to the particular software used, and thus provides no real advantage over the Shannon pipeline output.</p><p>This would become feasible if the community were to agree upon a standard definition of custom fields; this concept could be generalized to other scenarios in which both a variant and one (or more) other associated coordinates (in this case, a splice site, but elsewhere, perhaps the site of some specific interaction). This process would ultimately require an explicit definition of the content and schema for such additional fields, and would need to solicit views from the community to ensure widespread adoption. We would be interested in contributing to this endeavor.</p><p>

</p><p>We have conducted a preliminary comparison of p-values for specific evidence types and splicing consequences vs. coverage per exonic base (the coverage of the gene divided by the length of the pertinent exon) and found that the results were quite difficult to interpret. We suspect that this could be explained by the fact that, due to significant intron inclusion, normalizing by exonic length is not really appropriate. Cryptic sites and alternative splicing make direct comparison of these values difficult to compute.</p><p>&#x000a0;</p></list-item><list-item><p>

</p><p>Veridical does not currently address cases in which multiple independent variants pertain to the same splice site.

<italic>"I am a little unclear on the use of control samples vs experimental samples.

</p><p>Control samples consist of all non-variant containing (NVC) tumour samples (relative to the variant being analyzed) and normal samples. In the examples shown in the paper, we maximized the number control samples used (106 normal samples and, in general, over 400 NVC samples). Control samples do indeed contain splicing mutations and this is a strength of our statistical paradigm. We term them control samples, because we consider their read distribution to correspond to that expected from the null hypothesis, as they do not contain the specific variant in question. The &#x0201c;noise&#x0201d; introduced by these splicing variants in control samples ensures that we are testing the variant containing samples against samples with many, distinct, splicing mutations. Thus, the greater the number of samples, the smaller the batch effects, which makes the method more reliable. While the normal and tumor DNA sequencing data was paired to call somatic variants, we do not require paired controls for the RNA-Seq data. In fact, TCGA does not provide such data. Since we initially designed the software for the task of analyzing their dataset, we did not wish to assume that paired RNA-Seq data was available.</p><p>&#x000a0;</p></list-item><list-item><p>

</p><p>We do not have access to the TCGA tumour samples used. While TCGA performed Sanger validation of a small subset of their variants, none of the variants validated by Veridical had any associated Sanger sequencing data.</p><p>&#x000a0;</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic>"It would be interesting to see a comparison of the distribution of Ri values and results of Veridical analysis?"</italic>
</p><p>The variants predicted by the Shannon splicing mutation analysis pipeline exhibit changes in information content (&#x00394;R
<sub>i</sub>). The change in information content of a splice site is directly related to the thermodynamics of the binding event
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9446751">(Schneider,&#x000a0;1997)</ext-link> and therefore the strength of the splice site (
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9711873">Rogan
<italic>et al.,</italic> 1998</ext-link>;&#x000a0;
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12668917">Rogan
<italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</ext-link>). Therefore, one would expect &#x00394;R
<sub>i</sub> to be highly predictive of valid splicing variants, where cryptic sites are expected to result in increased splice site strength, and natural sites would be expected to be weakened.</p><p>The median &#x00394;R
<sub>i </sub>for cryptic variants in the set of pre-Veridical variants (those variants called as somatic mutations and predicted by the Shannon Pipeline to affect mRNA splicing) was 2.6 bits, while the median for validated variants was 2.38 bits. For non-cryptic variants the pre- and post-validation median &#x00394;R
<sub>i</sub> values were -2.52 and -3.18 bits, respectively.</p><p>The information content of cryptic variants actually decreased slightly in the validated set. This likely is related to other factors, such as the initial strength of the natural site and the exon length, which are not accounted for by this analysis. However, the average information content of natural sites did decrease, as expected. The reason for the decrease not being more substantial, again, is likely due to the involvement of other factors, such as the distance of the variant to the natural site &#x02013; which impacts its R
<sub>i</sub> value. We have refrained from including this discussion in the manuscript, since there is no requirement
<italic>per se</italic> for Veridical to be used with the Shannon Pipeline. An explicit definition of the required input format is provided in the paper.</p></list-item></list>

The software is fast and practical, being able to test thousands of variants in hundreds of samples within hours. This is the first software of its kind, and if accurate it will be a very valuable resource for clinical genomics.</p><p>That being said, while the article provides proof-of-concept and clearly demonstrates the potential of the tool with specific examples, there are several missing pieces that are needed to provide the readers with a view of its overall performance and limitations and to help them use it effectively.</p><p>
<bold>Major comments:</bold>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The article shows numerous positive examples, however there is no indication of the tool's performance in general.

Since these are absolute (non-normalized) counts, however, the method may not work if the variant sample is obtained with a different method, e.g. by rRNA depletion of total RNA whereas most normal samples would come from polyA+ libraries.

All references to figures pertain to the first version of the manuscript.</p><p>&#x000a0;</p><p>First, we address your comments regarding VAAST and
<italic>de novo</italic> exome annotation software packages. VAAST uses a feature-based, maximal likelihood, approach to
<italic>identify</italic> variants suspected to be pathogenic. While
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3166837/">Yandell
<italic>et al.</italic></ext-link> present a general, and indeed very useful method, it is very different from Veridical in two key respects. Most importantly, Veridical does not aim to identify putatively pathogenic variants, but rather, to
<italic>confirm</italic> existing
<italic>in silico</italic> predictions thereof. Although it is not designed for this purpose, one could envision using the likelihood approach used by VAAST to extract solely splicing variants, annotating them, and then confirming these variants using Veridical with corresponding RNA-Seq data (assuming such data exists). Veridical is the only software available for statistical validation of splicing mutations. While both programs prioritize variants, their goals are rather dichotomous. Similarly, Veridical depends upon the use of an (ideally conservative) exome annotation. We do infer exon skipping events (i.e. alternative splicing)
<italic>de novo</italic>, but only to catalog dysregulated splicing &#x0201c;phenotypes&#x0201d; due to genomic sequence variants. Since we rely upon existing annotations, improvements in this area will serve to benefit Veridical and complement it well. In many ways, our parsimonious approach was possible precisely because the problem we address is quite a lot easier to address than
<italic>de novo</italic> alternative splicing inference. We are not suggesting that Veridical be used to analyze all variants, resulting from exome or whole-genome sequencing experiments. The Shannon Pipeline, which predicts candidate variants, contains several default or modifiable filters which can limit the number of candidates input to Veridical. We are suggesting that our approach be coupled to existing approaches to act as an
<italic>a posteriori</italic>, hypothesis-driven, check on the veridicality of specific variants.</p><p>&#x000a0;</p><p>We consider alternative splicing to be a different problem, for the following reasons. The authors state: &#x0201c;MATS calculates a&#x000a0;
<italic>P</italic>-value for each exon isoform by comparing the observed posterior probability with a set of simulated posterior probabilities from the null hypothesis.&#x0201d; We do not simulate posterior probabilities; we calculate them directly from the distribution of control samples, which represent the null hypothesis. Further, MATS requires the user to set uniform thresholds for all alternative splicing events, which in our case, may vary between variants (i.e. inactivating versus leaky mutations). Finally, neither MATS, nor Miso or SpliceTrap provide any means of analyzing novel isoforms created by the activation of cryptic splice sites.</p><p>&#x000a0;</p><p>We appreciate your insightful summary of our underlying statistical methodology and appreciate the limitations of our statistical inference method. It is certainly the case that the use of different RNA-Seq protocols could prove problematic. Veridical is intended to be used with RNA-Seq data from the same individual as matched DNA-Seq data. We assume that the control RNA-Seq data are generated with comparable sequencing protocols. This has been articulated in the Discussion.</p><p>&#x000a0;</p><p>We agree that levels of intron inclusion and alternative splicing can be highly variable across samples, due to factors extrinsic to the mutation itself. Such variability is a significant contributory factor to the production of transcriptomic &#x0201c;noise&#x0201d;. Given that statistically significant levels of intron inclusion were observed across all control samples, the prevalence of adjacent intron inclusions (which is not uncommon,
<italic>per </italic>se), does not weaken the inference that the predicted splicing mutation increases the levels of intron inclusion.&#x000a0; However, in such cases, the statistical threshold to achieve significance would be higher. A recent analysis indicates that p-value thresholds of 0.005 to 0.001 are appropriate (
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24218581">Johnson,&#x000a0;2013</ext-link>). Our statistical approach tacitly accounts for this and indeed greater levels of such &#x0201c;noise&#x0201d; could actually increase the statistical utility of our computation. Because of a wide degree of variation of intron inclusion in both normal and tumor transcriptomes, we deliberately elected against normalizing gene level expression in the program.</p><p>&#x000a0;</p><p>Regarding the specific example cited, the 14 intronic reads in the sample containing the variant&#x000a0; in the read-abundance category (Figure 4 (A)) are contrasted with the per sample mean of 4.051 reads across all non-variant-containing tumours and normal samples in this intron (i.e. the totality of control samples, which results in a p-value of 0.04. We agree that this is not a strong result, and would not permit us to reject the null hypothesis had the threshold significance level been reduced to &#x02264; 0.01 (which the user is free to stipulate).In this particular case, the variant is still strongly validated, due to the presence of junction-spanning, exon skipping reads (that are absent from all of the control samples). We do not stipulate that the predicted mutation have only one abnormal read type, but rather, that the test assesses each consequence separately. We suggest that the corroborating evidence be taken together in support of variant-induced missplicing. Furthermore, junction-spanning exon skipping is, in general, rarer than intron inclusion in these data. Nevertheless, we do show examples of read-abundance tests for intron inclusion that achieve a significance level of &#x0003c; 0.01, such as within
<italic>TMTC2</italic> in Figure 6(C). As you point out, intron inclusion patterns also vary by intron and there are a large number of such intron inclusion reads in the downstream intron in Figure 4(A). However, in our entire set of predicted splicing mutations, we did not find any pertaining to the intron between exons 12 and 13. The observed increased intron inclusion between exons 12 and 13 may be related to the weak (5.2 bit) donor (5&#x02019;) splice site in exon 12. &#x000a0;In fact, substantial intron inclusion was expected in intron 11, due to the minimal strength of the exon 11 donor of 2.1 bits.</p><p>&#x000a0;</p><p>Regarding the comment concerning cryptic sites, we always mean non-canonical splice sites activated by sequence-level variation, which are distinctly different from tissue-related alternatively spliced isoforms lacking one or more constitutive exons. We and others have reported numerous examples of common SNPs inducing cryptic splice site activation, which could result in the annotation of accordingly altered transcripts.</p><p>&#x000a0;</p><p>It is unfortunate that Veridical had to be categorized as a &#x0201c;web tool&#x0201d;. We would have preferred to indicate that the program is a standalone-tool.
<italic>F1000Research </italic>&#x000a0;does not provide this category, even though other standalone programs have been published by the journal with the Web Tool designation. In the Web Tools category, the journal guidelines require that we provide a set of examples (complete with input and output files) representing the range of results that are obtained with the software. Therefore, providing a full analysis of the complete TCGA breast cancer dataset is beyond the scope of this paper.&#x000a0; It will be presented elsewhere.</p><p>&#x000a0;</p><p>We believe that the statements in the manuscript's conflict of interests section are sufficient to describe the terms of use.

This outstanding tool appears very useful to screen the wealth of transcriptomic data for effects in splicing due to mutations in disease samples, and I think that it will potentially be of interest for many if not all such RNAseq-based studies. In addition, this could spur further efforts to derive similar tools with improved efficiencies. Use of this method should help establish the importance of aberrant splicing in disease as well as the effects of genomic mutations at the RNA level. I only have two comments, that do not diminish my overall rating of this work as of high value:</p><p>&#x000a0;
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>I personally disagree with the widespread use of the word &#x0201c;validation&#x0201d; in the title, abstract and text. Authors describe Veridical as a tool to &#x0201c;validate&#x0201d; DNA sequence variants that alter splicing. Indeed, I think that this tool provides an &#x0201c;association&#x0201d; between the variants and splicing, but not a formal proof of their connection. As the genomic and RNA samples usually come from different individuals with many confounding variables, the possibility that the splicing changes arise from factors other than the individual DNA mutations cannot be ruled out. In other words, changes in the levels of trans-acting splicing factors could account in part or totally for the splicing changes across samples. The statistical tests properly conducted in Veridical are designed to minimize such possibility but do not rule it out. In addition, the inherent noisy nature of RNAseq datasets also prompts for caution in the conclusions. To me, the direct proof that a DNA mutation changes splicing of its pre-mRNA can only be provided using minigenes and cell transfection (or in vitro splicing), in which the substrate sequences and cellular context are under almost absolute control. Indeed, the Veridical method is reminiscent of GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Studies), in which the genotype in the DNA, wild-type or mutant, is associated to its phenotype, such as normal versus disease (or other traits) in GWAS, or normal versus aberrant splicing in this study. Thus, for me Veridical provides strong associations &#x02013; but not validations &#x02013; between DNA mutations and their effects on splicing.</p><p>&#x000a0;</p></list-item><list-item><p>As mentioned briefly at the beginning of Discussion, Veridical has built-in prediction tools to prioritize the mutations that are more likely to affect splicing, such as those mapping to splice sites. Even if other sources and tools are cited, a more extensive explanation of these components of Veridical would help the reader/user.</p></list-item></list>

<italic>in silico</italic> validation is not comparable to
<italic>in vitro</italic> or
<italic>in vivo</italic> validation assays. That said, we would like to elaborate. The DNA and RNA samples were matched from the same individual, which is not the case for many
<italic>in vitro</italic> assays, i.e. mini-gene expression analysis by reverse transcription followed by PCR. The very large set of controls used in our analysis is also atypical in experimental validation of proposed mutations.&#x000a0; When results are obtained that are statistically significant, it is conventional to refer to them as &#x0201c;validating&#x0201d;. Even if DNA-Seq and RNA-Seq data were not matched from the same individual, Veridical would still determine if known splicing mutations were expressed in a known subset of tumors, however we would instead refer to this as "corroborating".</p><p>The comparison with GWAS is inappropriate: we are not comparing means of distinct case and control distributions; rather we are computing the read distribution from the control samples and determining the probability that the mutation bearing sample falls within that distribution. Additionally, the initial hypothesis in a GWAS is quite vague. Thus, the resultant associations are not of the same category as those provided by Veridical. While Veridical does indeed validate the splicing consequence observed, when we say that it validates the mutation we do only mean that it strongly corroborates the mutation as a causative agent of the splicing consequence. The responsibility to decide if the p-value reported by the program is sufficient is left up to the user, who should avoid incorrect

<italic>"Page 5 (minor): Consider revising the sentence &#x0201c;Furthermore, this transformation allowed us to avoid the use of non-parametric testing, which has its own pitfalls regarding assumptions of the underlying data distribution&#x0201d;, since normally it is assumed that parametric tests ground on assumptions on data distributions, but non-parametric tests by definition can be used without information about data distribution."</italic>
</p><p>In this sentence, we are not referring to the ubiquitous assumption of an underlying normal distribution, which is indeed not required for non-parametric tests. Instead, the reference is to, other, lesser known, assumptions that are tacit in most non-parametric methods. The citation we provide (Johnson, 1995) refutes the commonly-held notion that non-parametric tests make no assumptions about the underlying data distribution, and describes numerous pitfalls that can occur when using non-parametric methods. For example, the author articulates a particular assumption implicit in a comparison of means via the Mann-Whitney test which actually requires that, &#x0201c;the two distributions are identical, in shape and scale, differing only in their means. This assumption can be harder to justify than the asymptotic normality demanded by the

<italic>"End of the next paragraph (major): &#x0201c;It is important to realize, therefore, that the p-values given by Veridical are much more robust when the program is provided with a large number of samples.&#x0201d; This is a pretty clear concept. Please, indicate a general rule to the user/reader: How many samples are required? Setting a reasonable minimum can be more useful for experimental design than saying the larger the sample size the most robust the result."</italic>

<italic>"(Major) I propose to reorganize the results (considering skipping less important examples; retain surely Fig. 4 and 6) and insert a first paragraph providing information about the dataset used for variants validation (how many samples, how many controls) and about the variant calling (BAM files can be obtained with different settings and criteria and the same apply to calling and filtering of variants). Moreover, please explain how RNA-seq data are treated, and particularly how they are normalized to guarantee cross-samples comparability."</italic>
</p><p>We now elaborate upon experimental protocols, processing, and data providence. The details of the RNA-Seq data and BAM file generation can obtained from the TCGA consortia, which generated them, specifically in the supplementary methods of

<italic>et al.</italic> (2012)</ext-link>. All of our data input directly into Veridical are available, and even the program used to generate the histograms is provided. This ensures that all of our results are reproducible.</p><p>The input data were obtained by analyzing the original TCGA dataset with the Shannon pipeline, as the paper describes. The pipeline has been published in a peer-reviewed context and is also available on a trial basis. &#x000a0;The details of the TCGA analytical results obtained with the Shannon pipeline are considerable in length, putting them beyond the scope of this paper and will be described elsewhere.</p><p>The journal guidelines concerning &#x0201c;web tools&#x0201d; state: &#x0201c;The article should provide examples of suitable input data sets and include an example of the output that can be expected from the tool and how this output should be interpreted.&#x0201d; &#x000a0;The examples shown are representative of the splicing analysis outcomes present in the full TCGA analysis.&#x000a0; The examples provided in this paper were designed to illustrate the capabilities of Veridical and are not an attempt to forge biological conclusions of this large dataset.</p><p>&#x000a0;</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic>"(Major) Also, a brief discussion about the impact of disease samples not carrying the given mutation can be useful, as well as regarding the possibility that a tumour sample not carrying the considered variant can present altered transcriptome since other variants (or factors) impact on the &#x0201c;molecular phenotype&#x0201d;."</italic>
</p><p>We provide in Table 2 the read counts for non-variant containing tumour samples, and for the variant containing samples. We acknowledge that cancer gene expression results in a gross dysregulation of mRNA splicing thereby causing the presentation of the altered transcriptome. This was a motivating factor behind our choice of statistical method.</p><p>&#x000a0;</p></list-item><list-item><p>

</p><p>If such exons exist, which are annotated as introns by RefSeq, and are actively transcribed in normal or breast cancer tissues, the large number of control samples will reflect this and such events will accordingly not trigger statistically significant intron inclusion events.
