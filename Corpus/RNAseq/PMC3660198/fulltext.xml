adaptation to specialized diets and in their evolutionary success. The obligatory symbiosis between the pea aphid, <italic>Acyrthosiphon pisum,</italic> and the bacterium, <italic>Buchnera aphidicola,</italic> is no exception as it enables this important agricultural pest insect to develop on a diet exclusively based on plant phloem sap. The symbiotic bacteria provide the host with essential amino acids lacking in its diet but necessary for the rapid embryonic growth seen in the parthenogenetic viviparous reproduction of aphids. The aphid furnishes, in exchange, non-essential amino acids and other important metabolites. Understanding the regulations acting on this integrated metabolic system during the development of this insect is essential in elucidating aphid biology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We used a microarray-based approach to analyse gene expression in the late embryonic and the early larval stages of the pea aphid, characterizing, for the first time, the transcriptional profiles in these developmental phases. Our analyses allowed us to identify key genes in the phenylalanine, tyrosine and dopamine pathways and we identified <italic>ACYPI004243</italic>, one of the four genes encoding for the aspartate transaminase (E.C. 2.6.1.1), as specifically regulated during development. Indeed, the tyrosine biosynthetic pathway is crucial for the symbiotic metabolism as it is shared between the two partners, all the precursors being produced by <italic>B. aphidicola</italic>. Our microarray data are supported by HPLC amino acid analyses demonstrating an accumulation of tyrosine at the same developmental stages, with an up-regulation of the tyrosine biosynthetic genes. Tyrosine is also essential for the synthesis of cuticular proteins and it is an important precursor for cuticle maturation: together with the up-regulation of tyrosine biosynthesis, we observed an up-regulation of cuticular genes expression. We were also able to identify some amino acid transporter genes which are essential for the switch over to the late embryonic stages in pea aphid development.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our data show that, in the development of <italic>A. pisum,</italic> a specific host gene set regulates the biosynthetic pathways of amino acids, demonstrating how the regulation of gene expression enables an insect to control the production of metabolites crucial for its own development and symbiotic metabolism.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Symbiosis</kwd><kwd>Pea aphid</kwd><kwd>Metabolism</kwd><kwd>Development</kwd><kwd>Viviparous parthenogenesis</kwd><kwd>Amino acids</kwd><kwd>Tyrosine pathway</kwd><kwd>Cuticle formation</kwd><kwd>Microarrays transcriptome analysis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Symbiosis plays a key role in the life of many insects that live on nutritionally unbalanced diets, such as plant sap, blood or grain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The adaptation of these insects to such food sources is possible only in association with certain microorganisms that are specialized in nutritional complementation. Endosymbiosis is, thus, a central process in these animals and more than 10% of insect species depend on intracellular bacteria for their development and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This is true for aphids that feed on phloem sap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], a very unbalanced diet that is characterized by a high concentration of sucrose and by very low levels of several essential amino acids crucial to the development of these metazoans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The obligate intracellular symbiotic bacteria in aphids belong to the <italic>Buchnera</italic> genus and they provide these important pest insects with the essential amino acids lacking in their diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]<italic>.</italic> Symbiotic bacteria are contained in specialized host cells, called bacteriocytes, that are localised in the abdominal haemocoel, close to the ovaries in sexual and asexual females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In fact, aphids have a life cycle that alternates sexual and asexual reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and the success of aphids as crop pests is enhanced by their phenomenal reproductive rates, through viviparous parthenogenesis, during spring and summer. Parthenogenetic viviparous females have two ovaries, each containing several ovarioles. In the pea aphid, <italic>Acyrthosiphon pisum,</italic> embryos at different stages of development can be observed, at any given time, within six or seven ovarioles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and an adult asexual female reared in the laboratory produces an average of 130 embryos during her lifespan. The vertical transmission process of the symbionts is vital for the reproductive success of aphids and it takes place at the end of blastoderm formation in the <italic>A. pisum</italic> embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. At this stage, approximately 1000 <italic>Buchnera aphidicola</italic> bacteria are transmitted from maternal bacteriocytes to a single viviparous embryo, and they increase in number by 120 fold during the remaining embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The importance of <italic>B. aphidicola</italic> nutritional complementation was initially indicated by the observation that aposymbiotic aphids (in which the symbiotic bacteria have been depleted using an antibiotic treatment) show significantly reduced growth and reproductive rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. <italic>A. pisum</italic> has been extensively used in laboratory studies and its genome has been recently sequenced and annotated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Several <italic>B. aphidicola</italic> genomes, from different aphid species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and from strains of pea aphid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], have also been sequenced. In fact, a comparison between the pea aphid genome and that of its symbiont [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] confirmed the previously hypothesized integrated metabolism for these two organisms, in particular for the amino acid pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The symbiotic bacterial genome includes genes for almost all enzymes involved in the essential amino acid pathways, while the few missing genes in the leucine, isoleucine, valine, methionine and phenylalanine pathways are present in the host genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. A recent RNAseq transcriptome study of maternal bacteriocytes, compared with other tissues, supports the integrated nature of the host-symbiont metabolic network: this is demonstrated by specific gene expression regulations of amino acid metabolism genes in the symbiotic compartment, compared with other aphid body compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>The availability of the genome sequences for both partners of this symbiosis opens up several new research perspectives for this genomic model of symbiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Functional genomics will help to characterize the role of different genes, and their regulation, in different physiological processes that contribute to the reproductive and ecological success of aphids. As seen in several other symbiotic bacteria, the <italic>B. aphidicola</italic> genome is reduced in size when compared to that of free-living bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and it shows a clear reduction in the classic bacterial gene expression regulatory networks (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]). Several studies have indicated the lack of a strong and specific transcriptional response of this bacterium following a stress applied to the aphid host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Nevertheless, a structured link between the organization of genes on the chromosome and gene transcription levels is conserved in <italic>B. aphidicola,</italic> as compared to the phylogenetically related free-living bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and, more recently, a specific transcriptional response of the pLeu plasmid to a leucine stress applied to the pea aphid host has been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The integrated metabolism of the two partners indicates that the <italic>B. aphidicola</italic> regulatory capability is connected to the host transcriptional responses to stress events or to different physiological conditions. Certain studies have analysed the pea aphid transcriptome in different tissues and physiological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], but no global gene expression analysis of the aphids&#x02019; parthenogenetic embryonic development has yet been performed.</p><p>Although the metabolic complementation between <italic>B. aphidicola</italic> and aphids is important throughout their life cycle, the symbiosis is thought to play a key role during the parthenogenetic embryo development (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]). For example, embryonic growth in aphids is highly dependent on bacterial-derived phenylalanine and tryptophan and, to a lesser extent, on methionine and lysine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. After microinjections of radioactively labelled amino acids into the haemocoel of adult aphids, the selective uptake of phenylalanine and lysine by embryos confirms their specific metabolic needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. It is difficult to determine whether this requirement for a high level of amino acids in pea aphid embryos is supported by the maternal tissues (maternal bacteriocytes and/or other tissues) or by the embryonic complement of the symbiotic bacteria localized in the embryonic bacteriocytes. It has been established that late embryos can rely on their own complement of symbiotic bacteria for a supply of essential amino acids, particularly for the aromatic amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. More recently, a study on the embryos of the black bean aphid <italic>Aphis fabae</italic>, maintained <italic>in vitro</italic> with artificial diets lacking amino acids, confirmed the importance of certain amino acid supplies, specifically phenylalanine and valine, acquired exogenously from <italic>B. aphidicola</italic> in the maternal symbiosis, and tryptophan, acquired endogenously from symbiotic bacteria within the embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p><p>In all the early <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies of embryonic nutritional needs, the ovaries were always analysed as a whole and, consequently, no data on the distinct embryonic developmental stages were available. More recently, a study on the separate stages was performed to assess <italic>B. aphidicola</italic> transcriptional changes during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. This work revealed that the number of <italic>B. aphidicola</italic> genes differentially expressed between embryos and maternal tissues varies significantly among the early, intermediate and late embryos, indicating that the symbiotic interactions between the developing host and its bacterial partner are dynamic, changing in response to the developmental age of the host. The availability of the <italic>A. pisum</italic> genome prompted us to complement this work with an analysis of pea aphid transcription profiles during parthenogenetic development. Using a NimbleGen custom microarray, we analysed the host transcriptome comparing different developmental groups, thus generating a complete analysis of gene expression during viviparous parthenogenesis of a symbiotic insect. These transcriptomic data were coupled with an analysis of amino acid metabolism, which enabled us to identify some key aspects of the contribution of the symbiotic partners to the metabolic needs of developing parthenogenetic embryos.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Global analysis of gene expression during embryonic development</title><p>Using the newly developed &#x0201c;INRA-BF2I_A.pisum_Nimblegen-ACYPI_4x72k_v1&#x0201d; microarray (ArrayExpress design ID: A-MEXP-1999), built on the pea aphid genome v1.0 assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], we obtained gene expression profiles of aphid embryos belonging to three distinct groups, namely early (EE), intermediate (IE) and late (LE) embryos, collected according to their developmental stage (see Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A), together with aphids at their first larval stage (L1).

As this analysis confirmed the reliability of our data following the dissection and isolation of the embryos, we then used all the data available to perform the following pair-wise comparisons: (a) EE <italic>vs.</italic> IE, (b) IE <italic>vs.</italic> LE and (c) LE <italic>vs.</italic> L1, using a one-way between groups ANOVA. Among the 24,011 transcripts analyzed, 3,945 (16.4%) were considered as being significantly differentially expressed during the development of the pea aphid using the following criteria: an adjusted p-value lower than 0.05 and a two-fold change in the considered contrast (see Methods for details of the analysis). Using these criteria, we identified, respectively, 1,264, 1,654 and 2,251 differentially expressed genes for the comparisons EE-IE, IE-LE and LE-L1 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S1). We observed an increase in the total number of genes differentially expressed during development, whereas the proportion of up-regulated genes decreased by 78.6%, 66.0% and 51.3%, respectively, in the three sequential comparisons EE-IE, IE-LE and LE-L1. This observation shows an activation of the expression of many genes in the earlier stages (comparison EE <italic>vs</italic>. IE), followed by a down-regulation of the genes important for development and not needed for the first instar larval stage aphids (L1). An analysis of the intersection between stages allowed us to characterize the developmental switches and to identify significant expression changes. For example, the highest number of common genes is found at the intersection between the IE-LE and LE-L1 comparisons, with 604 genes (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S1D). It is worth noting that, out of these 604 genes common to the IE-LE and LE-L1 comparisons, 516 showed expression changes in opposite directions in the two comparisons and, among those, 366 were up-regulated between IE and LE and down-regulated between LE and L1. These observations support the fact that numerous genes that are important in development are activated in the early stages and they are gradually repressed in the more advanced stages, up to the L1 stage. On the other hand, between the EE-IE and IE-LE comparisons, we observed a continuity of expression in the majority of common genes (340 out of 435 changed in the same direction, with 322 showing an up-regulation during development).

The whole experiment was performed again using three new biological replicates for each stage group and for these samples total RNA was not amplified (see Methods for details).

We classified all these pathways, in AcypiCyc, into five broad groups of compounds: lipids, amino acids, sugars, nucleotides, and others. An analysis of the distribution of genes within these classes, compared with the total number of genes in the pea aphid genome, did not reveal any significant changes that would indicate a class of particular interest. For example, 16.8% of the total number of differentially expressed enzyme-coding genes in our dataset forms part of the amino acid metabolism group and, in the pea aphid genome, the percentage of genes coding for this class is 16.4%. So, the number of detected genes is not significantly different from the number that would be expected by chance. The same is true for the other classes, but we decided to carry out further gene-by-gene analysis for those classes supposed, <italic>a priori,</italic> to play an important role in symbiosis or in developmental processes.</p><p>In particular, we analyzed in more detail the gene expression profiles of the 135 genes involved in the amino acid biosynthesis or degradation pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], which were present in our overall analysis and which represent one of the key functions in the physiology of pea aphid/ <italic>B. aphidicola</italic> symbiosis<italic>.</italic> This analysis revealed that the majority of the genes involved in these pathways are strongly expressed (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A): 78.5% of these genes are among the 25% of genes showing the strongest expression. Of the 135 annotated genes, 23 showed significantly differential expression in our comparisons (with 17 genes increasing and four decreasing in expression and two variations of expression in the opposite direction during development). Among the genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis, the significant ones can be classified into four groups: (1) the aspartate biosynthetic family (Asp, Asn, Met, Cys, Thr, Ile, Lys); (2) the phosphoenolpyruvate biosynthetic family (Phe, Tyr, Trp); (3) the glutamate biosynthetic family (Glu, Gln, Pro, Arg); and (4) the 3-phosphoglycerate biosynthetic family (Ser, Cys, Gly) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>: Table S6).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Amino acid metabolism gene expression profiling during pea aphid development.

Another three genes were annotated as potentially coding for this enzyme: for two of them (<italic>ACYPI000847</italic> and <italic>ACYPI008168</italic>) other EC annotations were supported by the analysis in AcypiCyc (EC 4.2.1.96 and EC 1.14.16.2 respectively), while <italic>ACYPI000175</italic> had a weak annotation score for the enzymatic activity EC 1.14.16.1 but it did not show significant changes in expression.</p><p>Four genes in the pea aphid genome (<italic>ACYPI000044, ACYPI006213, ACYPI004243</italic>, and <italic>ACYPI003009</italic>) encode for the enzyme aspartate transaminase (EC 2.6.1.1), which catalyzes the synthesis of phenylalanine from phenylpyruvate (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). Our gene expression analysis revealed 3 distinct transcription profiles for these four genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C): <italic>ACYPI006213</italic> and <italic>ACYPI000044</italic> showed a consistently high level of expression during development, <italic>ACYPI003009</italic> gene expression was constant and very low during development, while <italic>ACYPI004243</italic> showed a significant change in its expression level. The expression of this gene was relatively low in the early (EE) and intermediate (IE) embryo stages, compared to other genes, but it increased significantly between IE and L1 (2.37 and 2.91 log2 differences for the IE-LE and LE-L1 comparisons, respectively). The gene expression changes, detected using the microarrays for <italic>ACYPI007803</italic> and <italic>ACYPI004243,</italic> were also confirmed by specific qRT-PCR experiments (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S2).</p></sec><sec><title>Amino acid transport activation</title><p>We analyzed, in detail, the amino acid transport function using the recent annotation by Price <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]: our microarray contains probes for 28 of the 40 annotated amino acid transporters and four of the six annotated Na/K/Cl co-transporters of the pea aphid genome. All of the 32 genes represented on the array were detected as expressed in all the samples analyzed. Furthermore, as expected from the GO enrichment analysis, the majority (20 out of 32) of the genes coding for amino acid transporters are part of the significant group in at least one of the three comparisons (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>: Table S7). Among those genes, six out of 13 members of the eukaryotic specific amino acid/auxin permease (AAAP) family showed significant differential expression during development. With regard to the genes coding for the transporters of the amino acid/polyamine/organocation (APC) family, 11 out of 15 of them showed significant changes in gene expression levels during development. As for the Na/K/Cl co-transporters, needed to create the gradient used by the APC and AAAP transporters, three out of four represented on our microarray showed changes in gene expression. Our data constitute the first characterization of the transcription of amino acid transporter genes during pea aphid development and we found that not all of the genes belonging to the same specific gene family showed differential gene expression. For example, this is the case for the members of the pea aphid slimfast transporter gene family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] that showed developmental stage-specific expression profiles (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>: Table S7).</p></sec><sec><title>Accumulation of tyrosine in late embryo stages</title><p>We extended the analysis to metabolism by performing free amino acid analysis, using HPLC, on the same embryo groups used in the transcriptome experiments. To analyse the larval stages, on the basis of our transcriptome results, we decided to perform the analysis at two distinct time points of the first larval stage of development in order to monitor, in more detail, any changes in the amino acids content related to cuticle changes in larval growth. Therefore, our HPLC analysis on L1 larvae was performed on two groups: early L1 (age &#x02264; 6&#x000a0;h, including larvae at the very beginning phases of the cuticle maturation after birth) and late L1 (age &#x02265; 15&#x000a0;h, preparing the cuticle changes for the switch over to the L2 larval stage). The results of this analysis were expressed as a fraction of the total free amino acid content (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S8). For histidine and methionine, the concentrations in the EE and IE stages were below the method detection limits. For two amino acids (asparagine and leucine) no significant variation in proportion was observed between any of the stages. The aspartic and glutamic acids (both p &#x0003c; 0.0001) showed a tendency to decrease their relative concentration during development (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Threonine decreased during embryonic development and increased in the larval stages. Four amino acids showed a significant increased relative concentration during development (p &#x0003c; 0.0001): arginine, tyrosine, lysine and proline (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Among these amino acids, the greatest difference during development was observed for tyrosine in the late embryo group (LE), showing a six-fold increase in concentration compared with the early embryos (EE). The proportion of free tyrosine decreased rapidly form early to late larvae L1. However, phenylalanine, the precursor of tyrosine, did not show any significant change between any of the stages (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Proportion of free amino acids during pea aphid development.</bold> Free amino acid contents of early, intermediate and late embryos, and in the first larval stage taken at two distinct times of development (early L1 &#x02264; 6&#x000a0;hours and late L1 &#x02265; 13&#x000a0;hours).

In particular among the significant changes (see Table S8 for details) it is worth noting: a decrease of aspartic acid from 16.3% in the early embryos (EE) to 0.7% in L1 larvae; a glutamic acid decrease from IE (35.2%) to the L1 stages (around 17.4%); an accumulation of tyrosine during development from 1.9% in early embryos (EE) to 12.1% in the late embryo group (LE), accumulation that continues in early first larval stage (17.6%) to decrease rapidly to 6.8% for the late larvae L1.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-14-235-4"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Embryo development specific regulation of the gene <italic>ACYPI004243</italic></title><p>The matching profiles of the enzyme-coding gene expression for tyrosine synthesis and the accumulation of this amino acid in the LE and L1 embryo groups prompted us to perform a more detailed analysis of the genes involved in this pathway (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C). To gain a better understanding of the differences between the four genes (<italic>ACYPI000044, ACYPI003009, ACYPI004243</italic>, and <italic>ACYPI006213</italic>), annotated in the AcypiCyc database as coding for the enzyme aspartate transaminase (EC 2.6.1.1), we performed a detailed enzyme gene annotation using the dedicated PRIAM tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. This analysis revealed that, for all of the corresponding proteins, after the primary annotation as enzymatic activity aspartate transaminase (EC 2.6.1.1), two other complementary annotations follow: the enzymatic activity tyrosine transaminase (EC 2.6.1.5) and the enzymatic activity aromatic amino acid transaminase (EC 2.6.1.57) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S9). This additional <italic>in silico</italic> analysis confirmed the hypothetical role of these four genes in coding the enzymes catalyzing the aspartate, tyrosine and aromatic amino acids transamination reactions. The two more specific annotations of PRIAM are not included in the AcypiCyc database as they did not pass the cut-off point applied in the generation of the database using CycADS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Finally, we analyzed the gene structure and the genome organization of the four genes encoding for the enzyme aspartate transaminase (E.C. 2.6.1.1) in the pea aphid. Among these genes, <italic>ACYPI000044</italic> shows a two-exon structure, with the coding sequence restricted to exon 2, while all the other genes have an 8-exon structure (with the coding sequence spread out between exon 1 and exon 8). It is worth noting that the genes <italic>ACYPI004243</italic> and <italic>ACYPI003009</italic> mapped to the same contig in the pea aphid genome. An analysis of the protein sequences was performed and the alignment of the four proteins revealed the expected conservation, with the exception of the ACYPI000044-PA protein sequence that has a unique N-terminal portion which is not aligned to the other three proteins with the enzymatic activity aspartate transaminase (EC 2.6.1.1) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>: Figure S1). A detailed phylogenetic analysis of the four aspartate transaminases, expanding the protein information available in PhylomeDB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] and using the UniProt database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>], was performed (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>: Figure S2). The evolution of the aspartate transaminases, also called aspartate amino transferases (AAT) family, revealed five major duplications separating bacterial AAT (TyrB and AspC) from mitochondrial AAT (AATM or GOT2) and cytoplasmic eukaryote AAT families (AATC or GOT1). ACYPI000044-PA clearly belongs to mitochondrial AATM. ACYPI006213-PA, ACYPI004243-PA and ACYPI003009-PA diverged more recently and seem to be specific to aphids.</p><p>The peculiarity of the <italic>ACYPI000044</italic> gene structure, the differences observed in its protein sequence, and its phylogenetic position as regards the mitochondrial AAT prompted us to carry out an additional analysis of the ACYPI000044-PA unique N-terminal sequence. We can confirm that this corresponds to the mitochondrial targeting signal peptide. As a result, the ACYPI000044-PA protein has the highest score for potential export to mitochondria, when compared to the other three genes encoding for this enzymatic activity (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S10). The gene structure of 23 of the 26 AATM proteins, in the same clade as ACYPI000044-PA, was available (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>: Figure S2) and it is interesting to note that only two other genes had a single exon encoding the protein: these two genes are from the yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and the amoeba <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>The cuticle formation pathway</title><p>Tyrosine is used to produce DOPA and dopamine, both of which are needed for melanization and sclerotization of the cuticle.

In effect, the gene coding for tyrosine 3-monooxygenase (<italic>ACYPI008168</italic>), the enzyme catalyzing the reaction converting tyrosine to DOPA (EC 1.14.16.2), showed significant up-regulation in the comparison IE <italic>vs.</italic> LE and a reduction in expression in the passage from LE to L1 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">10</xref>: Table S11A).

Using a global analysis based on gene ontology (GO), we identified biological and cellular processes for which significant expression changes were apparent in the developmental stages under study. Between the IE and LE stages, several significant expression changes in the GO classes are linked, as expected, to the development of appendages and morphogenesis. In both the EE <italic>vs.</italic> IE and IE <italic>vs.</italic> LE comparisons a set of GO classes linked to amino acid transport were identified as changing significantly during development. To further investigate this observation, we analysed the set of pea aphid amino acid transporters recently characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] and we demonstrated a global induction of the majority of these annotated transporter genes during development (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>: Table S7). These observations represent the first characterization of gene expression profiles of this family of genes involved in amino acid transport during the pea aphid&#x02019;s parthenogenetic development. An intriguing amplification of ortholog genes of the <italic>D. melanogaster slimfast</italic> gene (member of the APC family) has been described in the pea aphid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] and we have analyzed the gene expression profiles of nine out of the 10 gene copies of this insect genome. Seven of these <italic>slimfast</italic> orthologs showed increased expression during development in the stages where embryonic growth is greatest (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>: Table S7B): this observation is in agreement with the role of these genes as nutrient sensors during insect growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Among these <italic>slimfast</italic> genes showing increasing expression during parthenogenetic development, we find the three paralogs previously identified as having an expression bias in male morphs (<italic>ACYPI003240, ACYPI005156</italic> and <italic>ACYPI002633</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. This observation does not contradict the male-biased expression, but further characterization of these genes would be interesting to gain a better understanding of their role in the growth of the different morphs. We can speculate that the expansion of this gene family in the pea aphid genome, and the increased expression of several of these genes during embryonic development, might play a role in the high growth rate observed for parthenogenetic viviparous embryos in this insect. This hypothesis could be confirmed by transcriptional analysis indicating either lower gene expression levels or different regulations for the slimfast genes in embryos produced by sexual reproduction and having a low growth rate.</p><p>The recent pea aphid genome analysis showed how the enzyme repertoires of the two partners of this metabolically obligatory symbiosis are complementary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].

Nevertheless, the known central role of amino acid metabolism pathways in this symbiotic relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and, in particular, during pea aphid development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], together with the induction of expression of the amino acid transporter genes observed in our experiments, prompted us to analyse, in more detail, all the genes involved in the amino acid pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Most genes coding for enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism showed strong expression levels (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), as expected given the central role of amino acids in embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. A significant induction of gene expression during pea aphid development, in the stages under study, affects several amino acid pathways (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>: Table S6). Among these, the pathway for the synthesis of phenylalanine and tyrosine showed significant gene expression changes in both of the enzymatic activities (EC 2.6.1.1 and EC 1.14.16.1) encoded in the pea aphid genome, for the steps complementary to those in <italic>B. aphidicola</italic> (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). To further investigate this pathway, which plays a key role in this symbiosis, we analysed the content of free amino acids in the same developmental groups studied in the transcriptome analysis. Our HPLC analysis revealed an accumulation of tyrosine in the late embryonic stages (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), coupled with a decrease in the aspartate content. It is worth noting that this amino acid is located upstream of the tyrosine pathway and is the amino group donor for phenylalanine synthesis (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This observed biochemical phenotype corresponds to the induction, during pea aphid development, of the expression of specific genes coding for the enzymes of the final steps of the pathway. Our work demonstrates the existence of an insect specific gene transcription regulation of this key amino acid synthesis and, thus, complements our previous observations of a lack of significant gene expression regulation of the aromatic amino acid pathways in the symbiotic bacteria during embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The accumulation of tyrosine during pea aphid development is probably facilitated by a total lack of the genes encoding for the tyrosine degradation pathway in this insect genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], a pathway that is present in 18 other arthropods (only one enzyme missing in <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>) with a sequenced and annotated genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://arthropodacyc.cycadsys.org/">http://arthropodacyc.cycadsys.org/</ext-link>; Baa-Puyoulet <italic>et al</italic>. manuscript in preparation). Tyrosine has been previously identified as the most abundant free amino acid in body fluids in another aphid species, <italic>Uroleucon ambrosiae</italic> (Strecker) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>].</p><p>A recent RNAseq study on the pea aphid, by Hansen and Moran [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], demonstrated that several genes, coding for key enzymes complementary to the <italic>B. aphidicola</italic> metabolic repertoire, are highly expressed in the bacteriocytes (the aphid symbiotic cells) when compared to the rest of the body, excluding the embryonic compartment. In the present work, we identified two pea aphid genes (<italic>ACYPI004243</italic> and <italic>ACYPI007803</italic>) that are regulated during parthenogenetic and viviparous development to supply the growing embryos with tyrosine, a key precursor to the cuticle formation and sclerotization process. In fact, two other genes, <italic>ACYPI008168</italic> and <italic>ACYPI009626</italic>, both important for cuticle formation, are up-regulated in the late phases of the pea aphid embryonic development: they code, respectively, for the enzymes catalyzing the reactions that produce DOPA (EC 1.14.16.2) and dopamine (EC 4.1.1.28), starting from tyrosine (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). DOPA and dopamine participate in the melanization (darkening) and the sclerotization (hardening) of the insects&#x02019; cuticle formed by cuticular proteins and chitin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. The observed general increase in cuticular gene expression during the late phases of pea aphid embryo development (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">10</xref>: Table S11) demonstrates that all components of this key developmental process in insects are active in the late stages of pea aphid parthenogenetic development.</p><p>Among all the transcriptionally regulated genes coding for enzymes that we were able to identify, the most interesting example is aspartate transaminase (E.C. 2.6.1.1). Among the four genes coding for this enzyme, only <italic>ACYPI004243</italic> showed significant increases in expression level during pea aphid development while the other three showed a constant expression, albeit at different levels for each gene (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). However, <italic>ACYPI004243</italic> showed a lower expression level in adult bacteriocytes in the RNAseq study, when compared with the entire body (excluding the embryonic compartment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Among the four genes coding for the enzyme aspartate transaminase (EC 2.6.1.1), <italic>ACYPI000044</italic> had the highest level of expression in the adult pea aphid bacteriocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In our study, we detected a relatively higher expression of <italic>ACYPI000044</italic> in the embryos and larvae, in comparison to the other 3 genes, but the expression levels of this gene did not change during pea aphid development. The same absence of change in expression during development is true for the other two genes, <italic>ACYPI006213</italic> and <italic>ACYPI003009</italic>, which show different levels of expression (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C) that are consistent with the results of RNAseq experiments performed on adult bacteriocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Although it is not possible to define the role of each gene coding for the enzymes with aspartate transaminase activity (EC 2.6.1.1) our data demonstrate, for the first time, that among these four genes only <italic>ACYPI004243</italic> expression levels increase during the parthenogenetic development of the pea aphid. This observation suggests that, in the pea aphid genome, <italic>ACYPI004243</italic> is controlled by a specific transcriptional regulation mechanism to respond to the need for phenylalanine and tyrosine synthesis during this important phase of development, with a particular link to cuticle formation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have characterized, for the first time, the transcriptional profiles underlying distinct developmental groups in pea aphid parthenogenesis, thus providing new data for gene function annotation and novel hypothesis generation. Furthermore, as a result of the combination of transcriptional profile analysis with a biochemical approach, we were able to show a correlation between gene transcriptional changes at the enzyme level and the accumulation/decrease of corresponding amino acids, demonstrating an embryo-specific gene regulation in the phenylalanine and tyrosine pathways. The integrated metabolism of the pea aphid and its symbiotic bacteria, <italic>B. aphidicola,</italic> is far from being completely understood, but our study elucidates, in detail, the role of specific genes in tyrosine metabolism for cuticle formation during the parthenogenetic development of this symbiotic insect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Aphid rearing and embryo isolation</title><p>A long-established parthenogenetic clone (LL01) of <italic>A. pisum</italic> was maintained at 21&#x000b0;C, with a 16&#x000a0;hour photoperiod, on <italic>Vicia faba (</italic>L. cv.

Three independent extractions were prepared for each group starting from 60 embryos for the EE group, 30 embryos for both the IE and LE groups, and 30 larvae for the L1 group (0-24&#x000a0;h). It is worth noting that the RNA extractions for the microarray and for the qRT-PCR experiments were performed independently, thus the qRT-PCR data constitute a full biological experimental replicate of the microarray results. For the qRT-PCR, the extraction also included a step of DNase treatment (RNase-Free DNase Set, Qiagen). Total RNA concentration and quality were initially checked using the NanoDrop&#x000ae; ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) and samples had to meet the following quality parameters: A260/A280 &#x02265; 1.8 and A260/A230 &#x02265; 1.8, in order to be used in the subsequent analysis. The RNA samples were then run using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) to check their integrity.
