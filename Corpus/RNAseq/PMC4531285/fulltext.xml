We previously reported a draft genome assembly of the <italic>desi</italic> chickpea cultivar ICC 4958. Here we report an advanced version of the ICC 4958 genome assembly (version 2.0) generated using additional sequence data and an improved genetic map. This resulted in 2.7-fold increase in the length of the pseudomolecules and substantial reduction of sequence gaps. The genome assembly covered more than 94% of the estimated gene space and predicted the presence of 30,257 protein-coding genes including 2230 and 133 genes encoding potential transcription factors (TF) and resistance gene homologs, respectively. Gene expression analysis identified several TF and chickpea-specific genes with tissue-specific expression and displayed functional diversification of the paralogous genes. Pairwise comparison of pseudomolecules in the <italic>desi</italic> (ICC 4958) and the earlier reported <italic>kabuli</italic> (CDC Frontier) chickpea assemblies showed an extensive local collinearity with incongruity in the placement of large sequence blocks along the linkage groups, apparently due to use of different genetic maps. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based mining of intra-specific polymorphism identified more than four thousand SNPs differentiating a <italic>desi</italic> group and a <italic>kabuli</italic> group of chickpea genotypes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Chickpea (<italic>Cicer arietinum L.</italic>) ranks third after common bean (<italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic>) and peas (<italic>Pisum sativum</italic>) in grain legume production and the only large-scale cultivated crop within <italic>Cicer</italic> genus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>.

On the other hand, effective anchoring of sequence scaffolds to the genetic linkage groups based on genetic markers to have a chromosome-level genome assembly is essential to identify genetic loci governing traits followed by marker-assisted breeding and comparative mapping with other species. To this end, two independent initiatives have published two draft sequences, one each of a <italic>kabuli</italic> type (CDC Frontier) and a <italic>desi</italic> type (ICC 4958) chickpea<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Draft sequences are continuously being used to identify trait-linked loci and comparative mapping of genetic markers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Draft sequences are subject to correction depending on the advancement of genetic and physical maps and chromosomal genomics data. Further sequencing of new genomic DNA libraries is also required to fill the sequence gaps within the sequence scaffolds so that genes present in the gaps could be annotated. High-density genetic and physical maps constructed using various technologies are continuously being made available. In this study, an advanced draft of a <italic>desi</italic> type chickpea genome assembly is reported. We sequenced new genomic DNA libraries to improve scaffold length and fill the sequence gaps. We used a recently developed high-density genetic map, constructed using an inter-specific bi-parental mapping population (<italic>C. arietinum</italic> cv. ICC 4958 X <italic>C. reticulatum</italic> cv. PI 489777), to anchor more sequence scaffolds of the cultivar ICC4958 to the linkage groups, which resulted in 2.7-fold increase in the total pseudomolecule length in comparison to the previous assembly. Moreover, gene prediction and annotation were carried out using advanced tools and databases resulting in the annotation of 2686 more genes. Comparison of the genome assemblies of <italic>desi</italic> and <italic>kabuli</italic> type chickpeas revealed an overall collinearity with some structural deviations, some of which might have resulted from the use of different genetic maps for anchoring.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Sequencing and reassembly</title><p>We previously reported the draft genome assembly of the <italic>desi</italic> type chickpea cultivar ICC 4958 using 13.4&#x02009;Gb and 43.7&#x02009;Gb of sequence data generated by 454/Roche GS FLX Titanium and Illumina GAIIx platforms, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. We further generated 1.01&#x02009;Gb sequence data from two mate pair (MP) libraries with insert size of 20&#x02009;kb as well as 23.93&#x02009;Gb paired-end (PE) sequence data from a whole genome shotgun (WGS) library with insert size of 320&#x02013;620&#x02009;bp using 454/Roche and Illumina Hiseq1000 platforms, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The new MP sequence data was used to improve the scaffold size of the previous assembly using NEWBLER v2.6 tool. Scaffolds and contigs of size less than 1&#x02009;kb were removed. As described previously, publicly available bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-end sequences were used for further scaffolding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. All these approaches reduced the number of scaffolds from 182,734 to 42,978. Sequence gaps total of 27,381,655 bases within the scaffolds were filled with PE sequence data generated by the Illumina platform using SOAP <italic>de novo</italic> gap closure tool version 1.1 and, thereby, reduced the N-content from 13.8% in the previous assembly to 8.68%, much lower than the CDC Frontier assembly (15.20%)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. A sequence span of all the scaffolds was 511,022,194 bases, of which scaffolds larger than 5 kb constituted more than 88% of the assembly. Sequences of bacterial origin were removed or trimmed by us and additionally by National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). After removal, the scaffolds were assigned to their corresponding linkage groups (LGs) using marker sequences of an advanced inter-specific genetic linkage map (manuscript submitted) constructed using a bi-parental mapping population of <italic>C. arietinum</italic> cv. ICC 4958 X <italic>C. reticulatum</italic> cv. PI 489777. Total span of the advanced draft sequence was 510,879,539 bases, of which sixty-five percent (333,999,488 bases) of total assembly was assigned to eight linkage groups with ~340&#x02009;kb/cM recombination rate resulting in 2.7-fold improvement in length from the previous assembly. Length of the smallest scaffold of the fewest set representing 50% of total assembled bases (N50) was improved from 77.31&#x02009;kb to 39.90&#x02009;Mb and N50-index was decreased to 6 from 931 in the previous assembly (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Seventy-five percent of total assembled sequence was contributed by about 1000 fragments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Sizes of the pseudomolecules were increased considerably, with LG4 being the largest (54.99&#x02009;Mb) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). We mapped back the sequence reads to the assembly to ensure the absence of any spurious assembly artifact (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).</p><p>Transcriptome coverage in the advanced draft assembly was calculated using two data sets; the 34,760 assembled transcripts of ICC 4958 and the 46,369 assembled transcripts (CaTAv2) generated from different tissues and development stages of more than seventeen chickpea genotypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. A BLAT search of these sequences in the chickpea genome showed that 95.50% of ICC 4958 transcripts and 92.30% of CaTAv2 transcripts were covered with more than 90% identity and 80% coverage, whereas 95.1% of ICC 4958 transcripts and 90.18% of combined transcripts showed more than 90% identity and 90% coverage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>).

Of all, 28,193 CDSs did not show any ambiguous base (N) in their sequences and the rest possessed &#x0003c;10% &#x02018;N&#x02019;. Total CDS length was 35.50 Mb with an average CDS length of 1173 bases and an average GC content of 41.60%. The average number of exons per gene was 5.1 with an average exon length 253 bases and the average intron length was predicted as 432 bases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). At least 25,986 (85.88%) predicted genes were supported by gene expression data (transcripts and/or RNAseq reads) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). 449 KOGs out of 458 could be aligned on the annotated genes with significant homology (&#x02264;1e-10) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>).

The number of rRNA loci decreased from 249 in the previous draft to 229 in this draft, while the total length was increased from 40.85&#x02009;kb to 52.22&#x02009;kb due to reduced gap within the scaffolds.

Pericentrometric regions in this assembly were found primarily rich in repeat sequences and poor in gene content as observed in soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic>) and common bean (<italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic> L.) genomes with average gene density of 5.57/100&#x02009;kb in contrast to 8.63/100&#x02009;kb in the euchromatic region<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.

Recombination rate in the pericentromeric region in this assembly was much higher than that observed for common bean (4350&#x02009;kb/cM)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.

Sequence blocks within the pseudomolecules in ICC 4958 assembly matched with those of the corresponding pseudomolecules in the CDC Frontier assembly. However, large segments within certain pseudomolecules in the ICC 4958 assembly were inverted in comparison to the CDC Frontier assembly, which could be primarily due to use of different marker maps. For example, most of the LG6 pseudomolecule in both the assemblies showed similar orientation, but LG2 of <italic>desi</italic> assembly was entirely inverted in comparison to the corresponding LG in the <italic>kabuli</italic> assembly. In case of LG4, half of the pseudomolecule of ICC 4958 showed forward orientation with respect to the CDC Frontier, whereas the other half showed inverted orientation. We performed pairwise collinearity analysis of orthologous genes in the two assemblies. Although, extensive local gene collinearity was observed in all the pseudomolecules, an incongruity in the positions of large gene blocks within the corresponding pseudomolecules of the two assemblies was evident and in concurrence with the observed pair-wise pseudomolecule alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>).

Sequence-based physical assembly is more reliable than the genetic marker-dependent assembly as positions of genetic markers change with maps with variable marker densities.

Likewise, Ca_08931.1 (Ca_LG4: 11287627-11291734) in desi assembly encoded a protein of 853 aa, while the corresponding gene Ca_07695 (Ca4: 647346-650769) in <italic>kabuli</italic> assembly encoded a protein of 811 aa. Both the gene sequences showed 100% sequence identity in the corresponding region.

On average, these gene models showed the presence of only two exons and high GC content (43.32%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S12</xref>).

These domains are related to or derived from retrotransposons or retroviral gag proteins and, therefore, appear to be originated by the movement of transposable elements, which is common in eukaryotes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. The fifth most abundant conserved domain present in chickpea-specific genes is ABC-transporter superfamily (cl21455) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig S10</xref>).

WGD followed by gene loss resulted in the existence of paralogous gene blocks. 914 pairs of genes in 110 paralogous blocks of five and more genes were identified in the present draft assembly. Four of these blocks were intrachromosomal (LGs 1, 4, 5 and 8). LG1 shared a maximum of 30 paralogous blocks with four linkage groups (LG1, LG4, LG5 and LG8), including 16 paralogous blocks containing 152 gene pairs with LG6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Functional redundancy could be one of the reasons for gene loss after WGD. Functional diversification or acquiring a new essential function would retain a gene after duplication.

For example, in a paralogous block between Ca3 and Ca4, both Ca_07448.1 and Ca_08925.1 encode 26S proteasome subunit 4 proteins. While Ca_08925.1 displayed a high expression in all the tested tissues, Ca_07448.1 expression was significantly low in mature leaf and young pod. A similar differential expression was observed for Ca_07431.1 and Ca_08944.1 encoding alcohol dehydrogenase class 3 proteins. In paralogous blocks between Ca4 and Ca5, Ca_9677.1 and Ca_015064.1, both encoding serine-rich adhesion proteins, and Ca_09637.1 and Ca_15025.1 encoding transcription repressor LEUNIG-like proteins exhibited contrasting expression patterns depicting functional diversification of paralogous genes.</p><p><italic>Kabuli</italic> type chickpea or the race macrosperma is considered as a derivative of <italic>desi</italic> type or microsperma obtained through selection for increased seed size using a narrow genetic basis in recent times after domestication of the crop<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>.

However, the success of this approach for efficient mining and genotyping of genome-wide SNPs relies upon availability of a high-quality well-assembled reference genome sequence, on which the sequence reads generated from diverse crop genotypes through GBS assay can be effectively mapped. Henceforth, to assess the efficiency of our presently assembled improved version of <italic>desi</italic> genome sequence as a reference for SNPs discovery in chickpea, we uniquely mapped the de-multiplexed high-quality sequence reads generated individually from 39 <italic>desi</italic> and 53 <italic>kabuli</italic> genotypes onto the present genome sequence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. This reference genome-based GBS analysis identified 2150 (mean SNP map density 141.9&#x02009;kb) and 2199 (138.7&#x02009;kb) SNPs among the genotypes belonging to <italic>desi</italic> and <italic>kabuli</italic> cultivar groups, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 15 and 16</xref>). The slight variation in the SNP density and thus diversity between <italic>desi</italic> and <italic>kabuli</italic> is possibly due to a more recent secondary bottleneck in <italic>kabuli</italic> chickpea<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. A maximum variability and density of SNPs identified between the <italic>desi</italic> and <italic>kabuli</italic> genotypes specifically in 30&#x02013;40&#x02009;Mb genomic region of chromosome 4 were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>), which is agreed well with the previous documentation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. This highly variable genomic location could be a target region of interest for further understanding the domestication-led evolutionary patterns in <italic>desi</italic> and <italic>kabuli</italic> chickpea. Numerous informative genome-wide well-distributed genetic markers with high intra-specific polymorphic potential are required for marker-assisted genetic improvement of the chickpea genome with a narrow genetic base. In this context, two groups each of more than two thousands SNPs differentiating the <italic>desi</italic> genotypes and the <italic>kabuli</italic> genotypes identified in our study will be of significance in the construction of high-density integrated genetic and physical maps. This will be also useful for genetic/association mapping for efficient delineation of genes/QTLs governing important agronomic traits leading to genetic enhancement studies in chickpea. Moreover, 2150 and 2199 SNPs showing polymorphism within <italic>desi</italic> and <italic>kabuli</italic> groups was derived from 715 and 757 annotated protein-coding genes, respectively. These gene-based SNPs could be utilized for establishing rapid marker trait linkages and targeted mapping of genes harboring QTLs associated with important traits in chickpea. Collectively, the aforementioned outcomes reflect the broader applicability of the present <italic>desi</italic> genome assembly as a reference for multiple NGS-based low-scale resequencing and GBS-derived SNP mining and genotyping-related analyses in diverse <italic>desi</italic> and <italic>kabuli</italic> chickpea genotypes.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have attempted to improve and advance the previously reported genome assembly of a <italic>desi</italic> type chickpea cultivar (ICC 4958) using an improved high throughput genetic marker map. Pseudomolecules corresponding to eight linkage groups were increased by 2.7 fold in size. Filling of sequence gaps amounting 27&#x02009;Mb with the newly generated short read data reduced N-content of the previous assembly by almost 50% and resulted in annotation of 30,257 protein-coding genes, 2686 more than the previous assembly and 1988 more than the CDC Frontier assembly. These genes accounted for about 95% of the chickpea gene space. The gene density analysis in the predicted pericentromeric regions suggested a low anchoring of repeat-rich sequences due to unavailability of genetic markers in these regions. This can only be improved by producing longer sequence reads and increasing scaffold sizes. As expected, the annotated protein-coding genes in both the chickpea genome assemblies displayed an overall sequence similarity. However, the lack of extensive sequence identity between ~30% genes may have resulted due to sequence errors or gaps and use of different annotation pipelines in the two assemblies. About 8% of all the CDSs in this assembly encoded for transcription factors. This is similar to the estimates in recently sequenced legume genomes, however, higher than those predicted in the <italic>Medicago</italic> and <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic>. Species-specific genes are originated due to gene duplication, recombination and movement of transposable elements, and encode proteins with specialized functions for the new species. The most abundant conserved domains observed in the chickpea-specific genes had the signatures of transposable elements indicating that the genesis of at least some of these genes was due to movement of transposable elements. Divergence of <italic>desi</italic> and <italic>kabuli</italic> chickpea types about 8000 years ago as assessed through the rate of synonymous substitution is consistent with the proposition that the <italic>kabuli</italic> type was derived from the <italic>desi</italic> types after domestication on the basis of traits. This reference <italic>desi</italic> genome assembly could serve as an efficient genomic resource for mining SNPs at a genome-wide scale in diverse <italic>desi</italic> and <italic>kabuli</italic> genotypes and thus would expedite genomics-assisted breeding applications and genetic enhancement targeting multiple qualitative and quantitative traits in chickpea. Finally, a pair wise comparison between the pseudomolecules of the <italic>desi</italic> and <italic>kabuli</italic> chickpea assemblies displayed extensive local collinearity in spite of some large structural variations. These variations might be due to the use of different genetic maps in the two assemblies, which necessitates the creation of a reference chickpea genetic map. The apparent disagreement between the two chickpea genome assemblies would limit their use in the genetic improvement of the crop. Therefore, a further improvement with the help of larger sequence reads and physically mapped BAC library is necessary to produce a reference genome assembly of chickpea<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Sequencing and assembly</title><p>DNA samples from the chickpea cultivar ICC 4958 were used to prepare genomic DNA libraries as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.
