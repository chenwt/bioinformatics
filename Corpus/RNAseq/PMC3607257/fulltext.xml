sites, termed origins, is a crucial step in understanding genome transmission in any organism. Transcription of the <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> genome is highly unusual, with each chromosome comprising a few discrete transcription units. To understand how DNA replication occurs in the context of such organization, we have performed genome-wide mapping of the binding sites of the replication initiator ORC1/CDC6 and have identified replication origins, revealing that both localize to the boundaries of the transcription units. A remarkably small number of active origins is seen, whose spacing is greater than in any other eukaryote. We show that replication and transcription in <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> have a profound functional overlap, as reducing ORC1/CDC6 levels leads to genome-wide increases in mRNA levels arising from the boundaries of the transcription units. In addition, ORC1/CDC6 loss causes derepression of silent <italic>Variant Surface Glycoprotein</italic> genes, which are critical for host immune evasion.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><sec><title>Graphical Abstract</title><p><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="fx1"/></fig></p></sec><sec><title>Highlights</title><p>&#x025ba; DNA replication origins are widely dispersed in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> chromosome cores &#x025ba; Origins and ORC1/CDC6 localize at the boundaries of multigene transcription units &#x025ba; Localization of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> ORC1/CDC6 is distinct in chromosome cores and subtelomeres &#x025ba; ORC1/CDC6 acts in transcription regulation, including of some VSGs, in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic></p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser"><p>Designation of DNA replication origins, the sites where DNA synthesis initiates, remains poorly understood in most eukaryotic genomes, including the relationship of this reaction with transcription.

However, the features that define origins, the loci at which DNA replication initiation occurs, are poorly understood for most eukaryotes (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Masai et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000e9;chali, 2010</xref>). Unlike in bacteria, where origins are DNA sequences that show both sequence and positional conservation in different species&#x02019; genomes (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Robinson and Bell, 2005</xref>), only in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> are similarly conserved sequences, termed the autonomously replicating sequence (ARS), found that define the sites of replication initiation (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Wyrick et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>). In other eukaryotes consensus sequences at mapped origins are lacking, and in particular in metazoa, it appears that epigenetic cues help define origins, which display an association with transcription the molecular basis of which is as yet unclear. Nevertheless, origins display mechanistic conservation. Eukaryotic chromosomes possess multiple origins, each bound by the six-subunit origin recognition complex (ORC; composed of Orcs 1&#x02013;6), which recruits the replicative helicase (the MCM complex) via interactions with Cdc6 and Cdt1 (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Duncker et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bochman and Schwacha, 2009</xref>). Initiation of DNA replication is regulated to occur once per cell division cycle through the actions of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and the Cdc7/DBF4 kinase complex (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Diffley, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Nuclear DNA replication in African trypanosomes, such as <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, has been little characterized, and in common with all protists, origins of DNA replication have not been mapped genome wide. Intriguingly, trypanosomes appear to possess only a subset of the higher eukaryotic replication machinery, potentially having a single protein with homology to both Orc1 and Cdc6 (ORC1/CDC6) (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Godoy et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Tiengwe et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>) and lacking detectable orthologs of Cdc7 and Dbf4 (data not shown). Trypanosomes also have an unusual genome organization, which may provide a particular perspective on replication. In <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> the majority of protein-coding genes are in 11 diploid megabase-sized chromosomes and are arranged in &#x0223c;150 &#x0201c;directional gene clusters&#x0201d; (DGCs) that contain, on average, &#x0223c;50 genes, but can encompass hundreds (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Daniels et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). Transcription of each DGC is thought to initiate from a single RNA polymerase (pol) II promoter, yielding a primary multigene transcript from which individual mRNAs are generated by <italic>trans</italic>-splicing and polyadenylation. Transcription initiates bidirectionally between divergent DGCs (at so-called divergent strand switch regions; SSRs) and at some sites within some DGCs (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Mart&#x000ed;nez-Calvillo et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kolev et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). These putative promoters display increased abundance of K10-acetylated histone H4 (H4K10Ac), K4-methylated H3, and variants of H2A and H2B (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Respuela et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Siegel et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Wright et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). Termination of transcription is also poorly understood (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Mart&#x000ed;nez-Calvillo et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>), but the ends of DGCs (which are frequently, but not exclusively, convergent SSRs) display increased abundance of H3 and H4 variants (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Siegel et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). A hypermodified base, J, also localizes to the boundaries of the DGCs (as well as telomeres, other repeats, and inactive <italic>Variant Surface Glycoprotein</italic> [<italic>VSG</italic>] expression units; see below) and influences transcription (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cliffe et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Ekanayake et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> nuclear genome also has hundreds of <italic>VSG</italic> genes, switching between which is the basis of antigenic variation, a strategy for evasion of mammalian immunity. Transcriptionally silent <italic>VSG</italic>s are located proximal to telomeres in &#x0223c;100 nuclear minichromosomes (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Wickstead et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>) and, more abundantly, in arrays in the subtelomeres of the megabase chromosomes (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Marcello and Barry, 2007</xref>). To be expressed in the mammal, <italic>VSG</italic>s are recombined into 5&#x02013;15 bloodstream <italic>VSG</italic> expression sites (BESs) at the telomeres of the megabase and intermediate chromosomes; only one BES is normally actively transcribed at a time (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Horn and McCulloch, 2010</xref>). BES transcription is multigenic, with the <italic>VSG</italic> cotranscribed with approximately ten expression site-associated genes (<italic>ESAG</italic>s) (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hertz-Fowler et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). Another set of <italic>VSG</italic>s, termed the <italic>MVSG</italic>s, is expressed in the nonreplicating metacyclic trypanosome form, a transmission stage found in the tsetse fly vector. <italic>MVSG</italic>s are transcribed from ESs (MES) that lack <italic>ESAG</italic>s and are thus the only single-gene <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> transcription units (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Ginger et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). All <italic>VSG</italic> transcription is mediated by RNA pol I.</p><p>Here, we present a global analysis of DNA replication initiation in <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> and show that DNA replication and transcription display remarkable levels of coordination, both positionally and functionally. We map ORC1/CDC6 binding sites and show that they localize to the boundaries of the transcribed DGCs in the chromosome cores. In contrast, we see high-density binding in the silent <italic>VSG</italic> array-containing subtelomeres. Mapping DNA replication initiation shows that early origins colocalize with a subset of the ORC1/CDC6 sites in the chromosome cores and display a spacing that is greater than in other eukaryotes. Finally, using RNA interference of ORC1/CDC6, we show that DNA replication functionally intersects with transcription because the absence of the initiator leads to increased levels of transcripts from the DGC boundaries and derepression of <italic>MVSG</italic> silencing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Genomic Distribution of the Replication Initiator ORC1/CDC6</title><p>To address how DNA replication occurs in the unusual <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> genome, we first profiled the genomic binding sites for the candidate initiator protein ORC1/CDC6 in procyclic form (PCF; tsetse midgut stage) cells. A hemizygous <italic>ORC1/CDC6 T. brucei</italic> strain was generated in which one allele was deleted and the other modified to encode a C-terminal 12 Myc epitope-tagged ORC1/CDC6 variant (data not shown). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-chip was then performed using the myc tag, interrogating an &#x0223c;385 K microarray covering the <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> TREU927 megabase chromosomes. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> show ORC1/CDC6-enriched sites in chromosomes 7 and 9, which are representative of all 11 chromosomes (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>). As for ORC in other organisms (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Eaton et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">MacAlpine et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>), <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> ORC1/CDC6 ChIP enrichment (up to &#x0223c;4-fold) is low relative to that of other DNA binding proteins, such as modified histones (H4K10Ac is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) or transcription factors (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Siegel et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). Applying a false discovery rate (FDR) of &#x02264;0.2, 953 ORC1/CDC6 binding sites were predicted, covering &#x0223c;640 Kbp (2.4%) of the megabase chromosomes. This revealed a striking, bimodal binding pattern, with dispersed ORC1/CDC6 binding in the interior of chromosomes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>) and denser binding at subtelomeres (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>).</p><p>To analyze ORC1/CDC6 distribution globally, each megabase chromosome was demarcated into three categories (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>A): &#x0201c;chromosome core,&#x0201d; the highly transcribed region containing housekeeping genes in DGCs as found in all chromosomes; &#x0201c;subtelomere-related,&#x0201d; a combination of nonfunctional and functional elements (e.g., <italic>ESAG</italic> [pseudo]genes, <italic>VSG</italic>-related genes, and <italic>RHS</italic> genes); and &#x0201c;<italic>VSG</italic> array,&#x0201d; which is also subtelomeric but has a more ordered arrangement, containing arrayed &#x0201c;cassettes&#x0201d; (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>) composed of 70&#x000a0;bp repeats, <italic>VSG 5&#x02032;</italic>-flanking sequence, <italic>VSG</italic> ORF (either functional or pseudogene), and <italic>VSG 3&#x02032;</italic> flank. The core (total size 22.3 Mbp, 73% probe coverage) housed 38% (362) of ORC1/CDC6 binding sites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>A), with an average spacing of &#x0223c;130 Kbp between adjacent members of 170 &#x0201c;unique&#x0201d; binding sites (those closer than 10&#x000a0;Kbp were grouped). In contrast 51% (484) of binding sites were in the <italic>VSG</italic> arrays (2.1 Mbp, 61% probe coverage), at an average spacing of &#x0223c;7 Kbp. Subtelomere-related sequence (1.3 Mbp) is underrepresented by probes (29% coverage), and therefore, the 11% of binding sites (107) at &#x0223c;12 Kbp spacing may be an underestimate.</p><p>Within the chromosome cores the ORC1/CDC6 binding sites clustered at the boundaries of the <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> multigenic transcription units. The promoters of these units have been inferred by H4K10Ac localization (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Siegel et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>), which identifies both divergent SSRs and intra-DGC transcription start sites. Thirty-eight percent of core ORC1/CDC6 binding sites (136 in total, mapped at FDR &#x02264;0.2) mapped to divergent SSRs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>B), of which 62 (70%) out of the predicted 88 such loci showed evidence of at least 1 ORC1/CDC6 binding site. Fifty-four percent of ORC1/CDC6 sites (202 total, FDR &#x02264;0.2) fell within DGCs, and virtually all localized to predicted transcription start sites: of the predicted 46 intra-DGC loci marked by H4K10Ac localization, 44 (96%) showed evidence of ORC1/CDC binding. Taken together, these data suggest an exceptionally strong association between ORC1/CDC binding and transcription initiation. Despite this close correlation in genome-wide localization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1</xref>), a functional relationship between H4K10Ac modification and ORC1/CDC6 recruitment seems unlikely. We examined the localization of H4K10Ac by merging those of the predicted 367 binding sites that were closer than 10 Kbp, and discarding those that were &#x0003c;1 Kbp in size, yielding 158 unique binding loci. Of these, 108 were found within 15 Kbp of a predicted ORC1/CDC6 site, and 92 overlapped with at least 1 ORC1/CDC6 site. However, the two binding &#x0201c;footprints&#x0201d; do not overlap entirely. At 70% of ORC1/CDC6 sites within a DGC and proximal (within 10 Kbp) to H4K10Ac, the initiator binding site preceded the modified histone (examples can be seen at 0.35 and 1.25 Mbp in chromosome 7; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>). In addition within divergent SSRs, where H4K10Ac localization is frequently seen as two distinct sites (e.g., 0.25, 0.71, and 1.0 Mbp in chromosome 7; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>) (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Siegel et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>), ORC1/CDC6 binding was found centrally, between these sites. Thus, ORC1/CDC6 binding appears to localize close to H4K10Ac, but somewhat upstream. It is also clear that the transcription initiation is not the sole determinant of ORC1/CDC6 binding: though only 7% of ORC1/CDC6 binding sites mapped to convergent SSRs, 24 of&#x000a0;64 such loci show evidence for ORC1/CDC6 binding (FDR &#x02264;0.2; 40%), and some clearly act as early replication origins (see below). It therefore seems likely that ORC1/CDC6 binds to&#x000a0;all transcription boundaries, but less efficient localization to terminators is not always detected by ChIP-chip.</p><p>To investigate the high density of ORC1/CDC6 binding in the <italic>VSG</italic> arrays, individual sequence components (<italic>VSG</italic> 5&#x02032; flank, <italic>VSG</italic> ORF, and <italic>VSG</italic> 3&#x02032; flank), comprising 69% of the arrays, were demarcated, and the extent of binding was compared (Figures <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C; FDR &#x02264;0.2). <italic>VSG</italic> 5&#x02032; flank and <italic>VSG</italic> ORF comprise the majority (40% and 50%, respectively) of <italic>VSG</italic> array sequence. ORC1/CDC6 sites were overrepresented in the 5&#x02032; flank (53% of sites) and underrepresented in the <italic>VSG</italic> ORF (15%), whereas <italic>VSG</italic> 3&#x02032; flank sequences bound the protein at a frequency commensurate with their contribution to the overall arrays. Despite these nonrandom distributions, we could not identify a consensus binding sequence (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>), suggesting that ORC1/CDC6 binding in the <italic>VSG</italic> arrays, like in the core, is not a sequence-specific feature. Indeed, because the <italic>VSG</italic> arrays are not normally transcribed and lack known promoters and terminators, it is conceivable that ORC1/CDC6 localization in this region of the genome is functionally distinct from that in the core.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Identification of Early Replication Origins in the <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> Genome</title><p>To address whether or not the mapped ORC1/CDC6 binding sites correspond with replication origins, we employed marker frequency analysis (MFA). This technique compares the copy number of marker sequences in replicating and nonreplicating cells; origin proximal sequences will be overrepresented compared with origin-distal markers during replication. Early-mid S phase and G2-enriched populations of PCF <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> cells were prepared by cell sorting (data not shown). Following library preparation and Illumina sequencing, sequence reads were mapped to the <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> TREU927 genome; read abundance was then calculated in 2,500&#x000a0;bp windows as the ratio of replicating to nonreplicating DNA, revealing peaks of varying amplitude (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>). We apply the following nomenclature to these peaks; OBR (Origin of Bidirectional Replication): Chromosome Number: Peak position (in megabase pairs from the left end of the chromosome). Thus, the second peak from the left end of chromosome 11 (at 0.55 Mbp) will be referred to as OBR:11:0.55. In parallel with the MFA sequencing (MFAseq), we performed MFA using qPCR on independently sorted cells, using a range of primer pairs to cover a selection of chromosomes. These data concur with the MFAseq data (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>). In total, 44.7% of the genome showed a degree of replication in these assays, in good agreement with observations in other eukaryotes where a temporal hierarchy of origin firing exists (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Masai et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). The cell sorting performed to obtain the S&#x000a0;phase population will have enriched for origins that fired in the first 50% of S phase. Thus, late-firing origins will be underrepresented or absent from our analysis. Nevertheless, several key observations can be made.</p><p>First, and most strikingly, the peaks observed are broad and well spaced, indicating a low density of active origins. We observed a total of 42 peaks of varying heights and found a correlation between number of origins and chromosome length (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>D). Extrapolating to the whole megabase chromosome genome, we predict a total of &#x0223c;100 origins, giving an origin density of 1 origin per &#x0223c;260 Kbp, significantly sparser than budding yeast (1 origin per 46 Kbp) (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Yabuki et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>), <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (1 origin per 77 Kbp) (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Costas et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>), or mammals (1 origin per 25 Kbp&#x02013;1 origin per 130 Kbp) (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Sequeira-Mendes et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cayrou et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). Second, all origins lie within the chromosome cores. Thus, as in other eukaryotes, telomere-proximal regions are late replicating: 95.5% of the replicated regions fell within the chromosome cores, with only 4% in subtelomeric regions and 0.5% in the <italic>VSG</italic> arrays (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>). Third, some peaks are symmetrical, whereas others are not. Symmetry indicates bidirectional replication at the same rate in both directions, and these peaks were found at divergent and convergent SSRs (e.g., OBR:8:1.45 and OBR:8:1.9, respectively). Asymmetric peaks, in contrast, were found at intra-DGC sites where transcription both initiates and terminates. In all cases the slope of the peak was shallower when the direction of replication follows transcription and steeper when replication direction is counter to that of transcription. Taking the example at OBR:8:0.86 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>), replication proceeds 2.1-fold faster when traveling in the direction of transcription than counter to it. This indicates that <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> does not avoid head-on encounters between transcription and replication (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>) and that such encounters impose a greater impediment to replication than when the two processes are codirectional (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Merrikh et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). Fourth, there is a perfect correlation between the position of the mapped centromeres of <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> chromosomes (to date, described in chromosomes 1&#x02013;8) <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Obado et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>) and the MFA peaks of highest amplitude. Thus, <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> replicates centromere-proximal loci early in S phase. Fifth, 39 of the 42 MFA peaks center on ORC1/CDC6 binding sites, supporting the proposed function of ORC1/CDC6 as an initiator protein. Nonetheless, it is clear from the two data sets that a large number of ORC1/CDC6 binding sites (&#x0223c;80% of the 170 sites grouped with 10 Kbp) do not correlate with active origins of replication (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>). Although some of these sites may account for late-firing origins, there are many instances where binding sites lie within regions replicated from adjacent OBRs, suggesting potential redundancy.</p><p>Detailed examination of the positions of the OBRs reveals a striking relationship between the localization of origins and the transcribed domains. Most obviously, 19 of the peaks centered on divergent SSRs, correlating with sites of promoter activity. An additional three peaks were found at convergent SSRs, which were not always scored as significant ORC1/CDC6 binding sites (e.g., OBR:8:1.89) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>), consistent with our suggestion that the initiator binds transcription termination sites. Of the remaining 20 peaks, 2 were found in regions with a more broken distribution of genes between the 2 strands and 18 within DGCs, all at regions of H4K10Ac enrichment, indicative of transcription initiation and termination sites. Thus, all the observed origins coassociate with the boundaries of transcription.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>ORC1/CDC6 Influences Transcription</title><p>In light of the association of <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> ORC1/CDC6 binding sites and origins with the boundaries of transcription units, and also the extremely high density at subtelomeric regions, we wished to address a possible role in transcriptional processes. We therefore examined mRNA abundance after ORC1/CDC6 RNAi. We first looked directly for a role in <italic>VSG</italic> expression by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>). In <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> strain EATRO795 (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Ginger et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>), four <italic>MVSG</italic>s and promoters have been detailed and shown to be transcriptionally repressed in PCF cells. We therefore modified these cells to allow tetracycline-controlled induction of RNAi and introduced an <italic>ORC1/CDC6</italic> RNAi construct. As described previously by <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Godoy et&#x000a0;al. (2009)</xref>, inducing RNAi against ORC1/CDC6 led to only modest growth inhibition after 96&#x000a0;hr, despite loss of &#x0223c;70% of ORC1/CDC mRNA (data not shown). At the same time point post-RNAi induction, significant increases (5- to 13-fold) in <italic>MVSG</italic> mRNA levels were seen (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>), suggesting that loss of ORC1/CDC6 leads to derepression of the MESs. To ask if this was true also for the BESs and in bloodstream form (BSF; mammal-infective) parasites, we analyzed RNAi in <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> strain Lister 427, where 14 distinct <italic>BVSG</italic>s in 15 BESs have been cataloged by <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hertz-Fowler et&#x000a0;al. (2008)</xref>. In PCF cells of this strain, ORC1/CDC6 RNAi (70% mRNA loss) led to the same slow growth as in EATRO795 PCF cells (data not shown). However, derepression of the normally silent BESs was much less marked than seen for MESs (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>A): of five <italic>BVSG</italic> genes examined, only three displayed significantly increased mRNA abundance, and only by 1.5- to 2.5- fold. In the BSF Lister 427 (90-13) cells used here, a single BES (427-2, expressing <italic>VSG221</italic>) is maximally transcribed, and the others are silent. In this life cycle stage, <italic>ORC1/CDC6</italic> RNAi has a more profound effect on <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> survival, with cell death after 36&#x02013;48&#x000a0;hr (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Tiengwe et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). For this reason, <italic>BVSG</italic> mRNA abundance was measured 12&#x000a0;hr post-RNAi induction, at which point &#x0223c;40% loss of ORC1/CDC6 mRNA was seen. No evidence was found for derepression of the silent BESs (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>B).</p><p>To address whether the aforementioned response is due to locus-specific functions of ORC1/CDC6 or reflects a genome-wide influence on gene expression, we used RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to compare mRNA abundance in PCF Lister 427 cells 96&#x000a0;hr post-RNAi induction relative to uninduced cells. Read abundance was calculated in 250&#x000a0;bp windows across the genome and the extent of increased mRNA in the ORC1/CDC6 RNAi-induced sample relative to the uninduced sample examined as a function of position in the TREU927 genome. In many regions, transcripts were seen from loci where there was no detectable gene expression before ORC1/CDC6 RNAi; this is shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref> for chromosome 10, which is representative of the whole genome (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S5</xref>). We also tested for loci that showed changes in mRNA abundance, from a baseline of detectable mRNA before RNAi, with strikingly similar findings (chromosome 10 is shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>). These analyses revealed that ORC1/CDC6 RNAi had a marked, nonrandom effect on global gene expression, with increased mRNA abundance for genes positioned proximal to the boundaries of the transcription units. These changes matched closely the localization of ORC1/CDC6 protein, with increased mRNA from the vicinity of divergent SSRs (e.g., &#x0223c;0.42 and 1.22 Mbp on chromosome 10), convergent SSRs (e.g., &#x0223c;1.40 and 1.80 Mbp), and intra-DGC initiation/termination sites (e.g., &#x0223c;0.80 and 2.35 Mbp) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>). The increased mRNA abundance was not greater at the&#x000a0;regions of early origin firing (e.g., four origins are found in chromosome 10; OBR:10:0.80, OBR:10:1.25, OBR:10:1.92, and OBR:10:2.65; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>), suggesting that it is not linked to replication.</p><p>The changes in transcript abundance did not normally result from elevated expression of genes within the DGCs (and proximal to the ends) but resulted mainly from increased abundance of RNA sequence reads upstream and downstream of the transcription start and stop points. However, in some cases, ORC1/CDC6 depletion did appear to undermine functionally significant gene expression controls (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>; genes showing significant changes in mRNA abundance; &#x0003e;1.4-fold), with increased transcript abundance of genes positioned at the end of both RNA pol I (e.g., <italic>PAG</italic> and <italic>GRESAG2</italic>) and pol II transcription units (e.g., <italic>ISG65</italic>, numerous <italic>PAG</italic>-like genes, and a putative iron/ascorbate reductase-encoding gene cluster). Expression of the <italic>ISG</italic> and <italic>PAG</italic> genes is known to be under transcriptional control (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Haenni et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Leung et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>), which at least for <italic>PAG</italic> is based on locus-specific termination or elongation control. Loss of ORC1/CDC6 may therefore result in readthrough transcription in all these cases. Increased RNA sequence read abundance after ORC1/CDC6 RNAi was also observed from the <italic>VSG</italic> arrays (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5</xref>), which emanated from intergenic sequences, and not from the <italic>VSG</italic> CDS (data not shown). However, sequence differences between the <italic>VSG</italic>s of <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> strain Lister 427 (which it was necessary to use for RNAi) and TREU927 (where the <italic>VSG</italic> array genes have been positionally annotated) undermine attempts to map <italic>VSG</italic> RNAseq reads, and so we cannot discount the possibility that ORC1/CDC6 RNAi has global effects on <italic>VSG</italic> expression.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The data in this study reveal remarkably precise localization of the replication initiator ORC1/CDC6 to the boundaries of transcribed domains in the core of the diploid megabase chromosomes that constitute much of the <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> nuclear genome. In addition the data show that these ORC1/CDC6 binding sites act as replication origins, albeit with considerable redundancy, and that the coordination of transcription and replication is not simply positional. Following ORC1/CDC6 RNAi we show that transcript abundance is elevated upstream and downstream of the transcription units and occasionally affects gene expression within these units. ORC1/CDC6 therefore contributes to the global delineation of the transcription boundaries in <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>). Thus, analyzing this highly unusual genome has revealed an unprecedented level of interplay between transcription and DNA replication in a eukaryotic genome. It appears that both these crucial cellular reactions are delineated into discrete domains, most likely through the functional interaction and colocalization of the underlying machineries. We propose that this functional organization of the genome into modules is possible as a consequence of the near-exclusively posttranscriptional basis of gene regulation in kinetoplastid organisms and may have far-reaching consequences for genome maintenance. Moreover, our identification of the coassociation of highly active and early-firing replication origins with centromeres may contribute to the development of stably inherited extrachromosomal DNA molecules in <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic>, thereby facilitating many forms of experimental analysis.</p><p>In fission and budding yeast, as well as in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, origins have been identified through genome-wide mapping of the binding of ORC and MCM subunits by ChIP and by mapping sites where DNA synthesis begins by trapping newly formed replication forks or by isolating nascent leading strands (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Gilbert, 2010</xref>). In mammals, ChIP of pre-RC components has not been reported, and therefore, origin identification has relied on initiation site mapping. Our work combines ORC1/CDC6 ChIP with MFA to define origins in <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic>, adding information gleaned from this highly diverged protist to our knowledge of what constitutes an origin in eukaryotes, revealing both similarities and differences. In common with most other eukaryotes, we have not been able to identity consensus binding sequences for <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> ORC1/CDC6 (data not shown), perhaps suggesting that epigenetic features underlie ORC1/CDC6 recruitment to origins (see below). <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> origins are found in AT-rich intergenic sequences (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Dai et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hayashi et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>), due to ORC DNA binding via an AT-hook domain on Orc4 (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Chuang and Kelly, 1999</xref>). A preference for AT-rich sequences has also been reported for <italic>D.&#x000a0;melanogaster</italic> ORC (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">MacAlpine et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>), which additionally appears to localize predominantly at active promoters with open chromatin structure (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">MacAlpine et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>), a feature of origins also observed in <italic>S.&#x000a0;cerevisiae</italic> (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Eaton et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). This appears compatible with <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> ORC1/CDC6, which shows preferential binding to genome regions that house the poorly defined promoters at the head of the multigene transcription units. These loci are marked by the deposition of variant and modified histones and display more mobile nucleosomes (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Siegel et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). However, the association between origins and promoters is not absolute in eukaryotes. For instance in <italic>D.&#x000a0;melanogaster</italic> a further study, mapping nascent strands, did not find enrichment at transcription start sites but instead at CpG-rich sequences frequently found in gene exons (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cayrou et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). CpG sequences may also be a feature of mammalian origins, which appear to be enriched at promoters, though are also found frequently within genes (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Cadoret et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Karnani et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cayrou et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Sequeira-Mendes et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). Finally, <italic>A.&#x000a0;thaliana</italic> ORC and CDC6 binding, and origin activity, have a preference for the 5&#x02032; body of genes (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Costas et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). For <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic>, ORC1/CDC6 displays localization to the ends of the transcription units, and these loci can act as origins, though with less efficiency than ORC1/CDC6 sites at the head of the transcription units. To our knowledge, origin activity at transcription terminator regions has not previously been seen.</p><p>Although our data reveal that replication and transcription in <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> functionally intersect, the basis for this is unclear, as is the mode of ORC1/CDC6 recruitment to origins. In <italic>A.&#x000a0;thaliana</italic>, origins are associated with CG-poor sequences that are enriched for variants of histone H3 di- and trimethylated on lysine residue 4 (H3K4), as well as the H2A.Z variant (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Costas et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). <italic>D.&#x000a0;melanogaster</italic> ORC binding sites appear to be enriched in histone H3.3, and perhaps H2Av, variants (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">MacAlpine et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>), whereas mono-methylation of H4K7 in mammals has been implicated in pre-RC assembly at origins (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Tardat et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic>, trimethylated H3K4 and H2A.Z each localize to transcription start sites (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Siegel et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Wright et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>), perhaps suggesting some conservation in ORC localization with <italic>A.&#x000a0;thaliana</italic>. However, the variant histones that have been mapped to date at transcription initiation and termination sites in <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> are distinct (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Siegel et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>), and our mapping and understanding of the function of all <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> histone modifications are undoubtedly incomplete (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Figueiredo et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). We also cannot yet exclude other, nonchromatin modes of ORC recruitment to DNA (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Donti et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). Thus, it is premature to say if epigenetic features that are common to the ends of the DGCs define ORC1/CDC6 binding and, indeed, are conserved with other eukaryotes. For the same reason further work will be needed to understand if the depletion of ORC1/CDC6 causes transcription changes indirectly, for instance due to changes in chromatin through loss of interaction, or if the <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> initiator plays a more direct role in transcriptional events (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Sasaki and Gilbert, 2007</xref>).</p><p>A particularly striking feature of the replication profile of <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> lies in the relative paucity of replication origins. We estimate that fewer than 100 origins account for replication of the entire complement of megabase chromosomes of <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic>. As discussed above, this is a far lower density of origins than seen in other eukaryotes. It is possible that the number of origins is constrained in part by the architecture of the megabase chromosomes, with their long DGCs. In this context it would seem intuitive that origins would localize to divergent SSRs, thus preventing clashes between transcription and replication machineries. Both bacteria and other eukaryotes have chromosome architectures that limit such conflicts. For example the rDNA loci in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> are arranged in the same orientation as that of replication fork passage. Similarly, in yeasts and mammals specific replication fork barriers exist in the rDNA loci to prevent clashes between transcription and replication machineries (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Labib and Hodgson, 2007</xref>). Interestingly, in trypanosomes we observe several examples where replisome and RNA pol are in opposition, resulting in a marked slowing of the rate of replication fork progression (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>). Thus, the low number of origins cannot solely be accounted for by architectural constraints. An alternative explanation lies in the possibility that trypanosomes branched early in the eukaryotic tree of life. Recently, Diffley has proposed that the increase in the number of replication origins required to replicate the increasingly large genomes that arose during eukaryotic evolution has resulted in selection for additional levels of control circuitry (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Diffley, 2011</xref>). The apparent redundancy of control circuits in more complex eukaryotes reflects a fail-safe situation to ensure once per cell-cycle replication at any given origin. It is notable, therefore, that whereas trypanosomes possess cyclin and Cdk homologs, they may lack both the important Cdc7/Dbf4 and geminin/Cdt1 systems found in more recently branching eukarya. Perhaps the limited control circuitry of trypanosomes has constrained the number of origins that can be employed to replicate their genome.</p><p>The small number of replication origins in <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> raises some further questions. The first of these relates to the excess of ORC1/CDC6 binding sites relative to origins. Even accounting for the fact that we have mapped to date only the origins that we estimate fire in the first half of S phase, it is likely that there are &#x0223c;2-fold more ORC1/CDC6 sites than the 100 origins. Furthermore, it seems likely that some origins fire earlier, or more readily, than others, based on the variable sizes of the MFA peaks we map. It is well known in other eukaryotes that ORC binding sites are more abundant than origins and that a temporal order of origin firing exists (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Masai et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Douglas and Diffley, 2012</xref>). The basis for this remains unclear, but it is likely that early origins have a higher affinity for replication factors. In the context of the <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> genome, where it is likely that all promoters are equally active and initiate transcription constitutively, how differences emerge in the efficiency of ORC1/CDC6 binding or downstream replication events is unclear. The second question relates to replication of the <italic>VSG</italic> array-containing subtelomeres. Although we find exceptionally high density of ORC1/CDC6 binding in the <italic>VSG</italic> arrays, we see no evidence for origin activity. It is possible that, as in other eukaryotes such as <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hayashi et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>), these subtelomeric regions are late replicating and have not been captured by the MFAseq. Alternatively, the high-abundance ORC1/CDC6 sites may act as many dormant origins (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Blow et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>), perhaps because replication of these chromosome domains is distinct from the cores due to the lack of <italic>VSG</italic> array transcription. A final possibility is that ORC1/CDC6 provides a distinct, nonreplication function in this chromosome domain. Whether it acts as a silencer, as in yeast and mammals (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Prasanth et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hickman and Rusche, 2010</xref>), is unknown, but this may be compatible with the increased expression on <italic>MVSG</italic> genes after ORC1/CDC6 RNAi that we observe. Indeed, Orc1 in <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> displays localization to telomeres (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Mancio-Silva et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>) reminiscent of what we describe here in <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic>. Because both parasites populate their telomeres with genes central to antigenic variation, this perhaps suggests a common connection between immune evasion and the ORC machinery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec4"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><p><italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> PCF cells were of strain TREU927, Lister 427, or EATRO795 and were grown at 27&#x000b0;C in SDM-79 medium.

Reactions were run on an ABI Prism 7000 thermocycler and mRNA levels quantified from amplification according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions; conditions for all reactions were 50&#x000b0;C for 2&#x000a0;min, 95&#x000b0;C for 10&#x000a0;min, followed by 40 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 15&#x000a0;s and 60&#x000b0;C for 1&#x000a0;min.

After the wash, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer 1 (50&#x000a0;mM HEPES [pH 7.55], 140&#x000a0;mM NaCl, 1.0&#x000a0;mM EDTA, 1.0&#x000a0;mM EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.25% Triton X-100, 0.5% NP-40, and protease inhibitors), vortexed thoroughly, and rocked on a platform rocker for 10&#x000a0;min. After rocking, the cells were centrifuged at 4,000&#x000a0;&#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 20&#x000a0;min at 4&#x000b0;C, and the supernatant was decanted.

After decanting the supernatant from this step, the pellet was finally resuspended in 2&#x000a0;ml of lysis buffer 3 (10&#x000a0;mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.8], 100&#x000a0;mM NaCl, 1.0&#x000a0;mM EDTA, 0.1% Na-Deoxycholate, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine, and protease inhibitors). Next, the whole-cell lysates were sonicated for 60 cycles (30&#x000a0;s on/30&#x000a0;s off) using a Bioruptor (Diagenode), giving a DNA size range of 0.2&#x02013;1.0 Kbp (assessed by gel electrophoresis). After sonication, the material was centrifuged at 16,100&#x000a0;&#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 10&#x000a0;min at 4&#x000b0;C and a 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l aliquot removed to serve as the &#x0201c;input sample.&#x0201d; IPs were then performed overnight with 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Millipore) coupled to M-280 IgG magnetic Dynabeads (Invitrogen). Beads were washed seven times with ice-cold wash buffer (50&#x000a0;mM HEPES [pH 7.55], 500&#x000a0;mM LiCl, 1.0&#x000a0;mM EDTA, 1.0&#x000a0;mM EGTA, 0.7% Na deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, and protease inhibitor), each time collecting the beads and discarding the supernatant, and then washed with 1&#x000a0;ml TE wash buffer (50&#x000a0;mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 50&#x000a0;mM NaCl, and 1.0&#x000a0;mM EDTA).

A total of 220&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of elution buffer (50&#x000a0;mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 1% SDS, 10&#x000a0;mM EDTA) was then added to the samples and incubated in a 65&#x000b0;C water bath for 30&#x000a0;min with vortexing every 2&#x02013;5&#x000a0;min. The beads were then centrifuged for 1&#x000a0;min at 16,100&#x000a0;&#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> at room temperature. A total of 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of the supernatant was removed after the spin step and transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube. This served as the eluate, from which DNA was reverse crosslinked from proteins. To do this, 3&#x000a0;vol of elution buffer was added to the &#x0201c;input sample&#x0201d; and mixed thoroughly. From here the &#x0201c;input sample&#x0201d; was treated like the eluted IP material. Both samples were reverse crosslinked by incubating at 65&#x000b0;C for &#x0223c;9&#x000a0;hr (not more than 15&#x000a0;hr). After incubation, 8&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of RNaseA (from a stock of 10&#x000a0;mg.ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was added to each sample and mixed by inverting the tubes several times, and this was then incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 2&#x000a0;hr. Next, 4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of Proteinase K (from a stock of 20&#x000a0;mg.ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was added to each sample and mixed by inverting the tube several times, and incubated at 55&#x000b0;C for 2&#x000a0;hr. The DNA was then purified using a QIAGEN gel extraction kit and eluted with 60&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l elution buffer, following the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. The purified DNA was then repaired using the Quick Blunting kit (NEB) according to manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. After the repair step, DNA was purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN), according to manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions, and eluted with 41&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of H<sub>2</sub>O. The purified DNA was then amplified using the Whole Genome Amplification kit (Sigma-Aldrich) and purified using the PCR purification Kit from QIAGEN, both according to manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. A total of 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of the eluted DNA was run on a 1.5% agarose gel, and the remaining material was quantified using a NanoDrop. For microarray analysis, &#x0223c;5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of input and eluted DNA was used, and labeling, hybridization, and data acquisition were performed by NimbleGen. TbORC1/CDC6-Myc IP DNA was labeled with Cy5 and input sample labeled with Cy3, and these were then cohybridized to the microarray. After cohybridization, data acquisition, and analysis by NimbleGen, the scaled log2 ratio and peak data sets were aligned with the annotated genome sequence coordinates from <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> strain TREU927 using NimbleGen SignalMap software. For visualization the scaled log2 ratio data were manually adjusted to a minimum value of zero on the y axis of the plots, corresponding to an equal abundance of the Cy5-labeled sample and Cy3-labeled samples; positive log2 ratios correspond to enrichment of Cy5-labeled ChIP DNA relative to the Cy3-labeled input. To analyze the data, the scaled log2 ratio was normalized by searching for four or more probes whose signals were above specified cutoff values (percentage of a hypothetical maximum, which is the mean&#x000a0;+ 6 [SD]), ranging from 90% to 15%, using a sliding window of 500&#x000a0;bp. The ratio data were then randomized 20 times to evaluate the probability of false positives, allowing the assignment of likely ORC1/CDC6 binding and sites, which were dependent on specified FDRs of &#x02264;0.05 (5% of sites will be incorrect), 0.05&#x02013;0.1 (5%&#x02013;10% incorrect), and 0.1&#x02013;0.2 (10%&#x02013;20% incorrect).</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><title>MFA</title><p>PCF <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> TREU 927 cells were used. To prepare cells for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), cells were grown in 200&#x000a0;ml of SDM-79 medium to a density of 5&#x000a0;&#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells.ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and harvested by centrifugation at 500&#x000a0;&#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 20&#x000a0;min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.5&#x000a0;ml of PBS and fixed with 1% formaldehyde in PBS. After quenching the formaldehyde with glycine, cells were permeabilized with 0.01% Triton X-100 in PBS, then incubated for 1&#x000a0;hr at 37&#x000b0;C with 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g.ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> RNaseA, and stained with 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g.ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> propidium iodide. Cells were sorted by FACS using a Dako Cytomation Mo-Flo high-speed Sorter. A 488&#x000a0;nm laser at 100 mW was used, and emitted light collected through a 630/30 band-pass filter with a photomultiplier tube at 770V. Gating was set on side-scatter, then by the fluorescence measured on a linear scale. Sorted S phase and G2 cell fractions were centrifuged at 1,500&#x000a0;&#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 10&#x000a0;min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of buffer ATL (QIAGEN) and incubated with 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of Proteinase K solution (QIAGEN) at 65&#x000b0;C overnight to reverse crosslinking, after which DNA was extracted using a QIAamp DNA Micro Kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. The amount of DNA in each sample was determined using a Qubit 2.0 (Invitrogen), and 200&#x000a0;ng of each was sent for library preparation and Illumina sequencing. Paired-end 100&#x000a0;bp reads were obtained and mapped to the genome of <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> strain TREU927 (TriTrypDB release 3.3) using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Li and Durbin, 2010</xref>). The read depth for each sample was determined for each nucleotide position along each chromosome, by summing the reads that covered that nucleotide. The read-depth data for each position were then binned into 2,500&#x000a0;bp sections, and the average value across each 2,500&#x000a0;bp bin was used to calculate the ratio of read-depth between the S and G2 samples, with the baseline for each chromosome normalized to one. For MFA by qPCR, primer pairs were designed to target amplicons of approximately 70&#x000a0;bp situated throughout chromosomes 4, 6, and 8 (primer sequences available on request). Reactions were prepared in quadruplicate using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Each plate included the same control (an empirically determined region of chromosome 6 that showed no evidence for replication in the G2 sample) used to normalize the results and compare between plates. Reactions were run on an Eppendorf Realplex Mastercycler (in Oxford) and an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR system (in Glasgow), using the same two-step PCR-cycling conditions on each (10&#x000a0;min hold step at 95&#x000b0;C, followed by 40 cycles of 15&#x000a0;s at 95&#x000b0;C, 60&#x000a0;s at 60&#x000b0;C). The fluorescence intensity was recorded at the end of the annealing/extension phase in each cycle. For each amplicon the average Ct value was determined, and the relative amount of DNA present was calculated using the &#x00394;&#x00394;Ct method by <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Livak and Schmittgen (2001)</xref>. Briefly, differences in the total amount of DNA present in each sample are determined by normalizing to a calibrator (the control region on chromosome 6), and the difference between the normalized values for S phase and G2 samples at the region of interest is used to determine the relative quantity of S phase DNA at that position.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><title>RNAseq Analysis of mRNA Abundance</title><p>RNA was prepared from PCF Lister 427 cells 96&#x000a0;hr after tetracycline induction of RNAi against ORC1/CDC6 and from control cells that had not been treated with tetracycline. cDNA was then generated from polyA-selected RNA and Illumina Tru-Seq RNA libraries prepared, from which the samples were sequenced on an Illumina GAIIX (performed in the Sir Henry Wellcome Functional Genomics Facility, University of Glasgow). The Illumina reads from each sample were converted to Sanger-encoded quality scores and trimmed such that the median score for each read was &#x0003e;20. The reads were aligned to&#x000a0;the genome using Bowtie (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Langmead et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>) with parameters that&#x000a0;report the best 10 alignments for reads with multiple alignments but remove reads that map to more than 50 locations in the genome (-S -k10&#x02212;best&#x02212;strata -m50). This allowed some sensitivity to families of closely related genes but did not allow them to be overrepresented in the further analysis. Gene expression values were calculated as FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon per million reads mapped) with Cufflinks (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Trapnell et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>), using parameters that correct for read bias using the genomic background and reweight reads with multiple alignments (-N -u -b reference.fasta -G reference.gtf). Read depth per position in the genome was generated using the RNAseq bam files using SAMtools (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Li et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>) (SAMtools mpileup -B) and awk. These were loaded into R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.R-project.org/">http://www.R-project.org/</ext-link>) and normalized using quantile normalization to make the read counts and distributions comparable. To detect those regions where mRNA was expressed and abundance changed, the ratio of read depth for the RNAi-induced to -uninduced samples was then calculated and log2 transformed. To detect those regions where there was no RNAseq reads in one sample, but where reads were detected in the other sample, the positions with zero in either of the samples were set to 0.00001; this highlighted peaks of expression. In each case, reads were binned into 250 bases along the chromosome, and the median depth for each bin was used as the center value. These data were then smoothed, using a running median with a window of 7 to remove some of the background noise, and visualized by SignalMap.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.4"><title>Chromosome Annotation</title><p>Megabase chromosomes were demarcated into discrete regions using a custom Perl script.

Enrichment of ORC1/CDC6-bound DNA relative to the input is shown in the second bottom panel; values are plotted as the log2 ratio (y axis) of sample/input and were calculated over a 500&#x000a0;bp sliding window. In the panel above, predicted ORC1/CDC6 binding sites are identified as &#x0201c;peaks,&#x0201d; which are shown by vertical lines colored to indicate the likelihood of being an ORC1/CDC6 binding site based on three categories of FDR: red indicates the highest confidence (FDR &#x02264;0.05), and orange and yellow decreasing confidence (FDRs of 0.05&#x02013;0.1 and 0.1&#x02013;0.2, respectively).

Changes in mRNA abundance following ORC1/CDC6 RNAi are compared by two methods: the third panel shows regions where RNAi results in detectable RNA sequence tags in the RNAi-induced sample but not in the uninduced (vertical blue lines; height is arbitrary, and width is shown in 250&#x000a0;bp windows); the fourth panel shows the change in RNA sequence tag abundance in the RNAi-induced sample relative to the uninduced sample across the chromosome (green vertical lines denote fold change of induced/uninduced as log2 values [y axis], mapped in 250&#x000a0;bp windows). Fifth panel details the direction of transcription of the genes (light blue indicates a DGC transcribed toward the right, and very light blue a cluster transcribed toward the left) and highlights the positions of convergent (midblue box) and divergent (dark-blue box) SSRs. Bottom panel presents the locations of CDS (gray boxes).

DGCs are shown as gray boxes, with origins of bidirectional replication as ovals. Transcription start sites are shown as vertical black lines, transcripts and their direction as horizontal black arrows, and termination sites as vertical red bars. Upon ORC1/CDC6 depletion, replication initiation efficiency reduces (small ovals), and termination barriers become more porous (red dotted lines), allowing a proportion of transcripts to elongate through them (dotted horizontal lines). In addition, start site definition becomes less precise (clustered vertical black lines). The consequence of this lack of precision in both transcription start and termination sites is elevated levels of transcripts at the boundaries of the DGCs.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr7"/></fig><fig id="figs1"><label>Figure&#x000a0;S1</label><caption><p>Mapping ORC1/CDC6 Binding Sites in the <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> Megabase Chromosomes, Related to <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></p><p>TbORC1/CDC6-Myc ChIP and input DNA were labeled with Cy5 and Cy3, respectively, and co-hybridized to a <italic>T.&#x000a0;brucei</italic> 385K tiled array.
