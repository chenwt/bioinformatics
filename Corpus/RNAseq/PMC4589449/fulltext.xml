GEIs consist of discrete DNA segments (ranging from 10 to 200 kbp in size) which sometimes differ in their nucleotide features (G+C content or codon usage) from the rest of the genome, and have often been found in the vicinity of tRNA or tRNA-like genes. The boundaries of these islands frequently correspond to perfect or near-perfect direct repeats (DRs). These regions often harbor functional or cryptic genes encoding integrases originated from phages or genes involved in plasmid conjugation processes. GEIs thus include elements of other kinds such as integrative and conjugative elements (ICE), conjugative transposons and cryptic or defective prophages and can result from one or several HGT events and genomic rearrangements [<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Thus, studying bacterial colonization of diverse niches is one way to understand the forces driving bacterial evolution [<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which plays a particularly important role in habitats with high levels of toxic metals that provide stressful conditions. These extreme habitats can arise naturally, or as a result of human activities, although in both cases, bacteria have adapted to thrive in these challenging ecological niches. Acid mine drainage (AMD) is an excellent example of a stressful environment in which only few organisms can survive. Mining activities, involving the processing of sulfide ores, lead to the production of toxic, metal rich waste, and when mines are left exposed, weathering of the ores results in AMD [<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Ultimately, AMD contaminates runoff and produces streams with acidic pH and high concentrations of heavy metals. Common pollutants include arsenite (As(III)) and arsenate (As(V)), two inorganic forms of arsenic (As) which are highly toxic and dramatically impact microbial community composition. The Carnoul&#x000e8;s site in the south of France has a typical AMD profile with a pH of approximately 3 and particularly high levels of As, ranging in concentration from 50 to 350 mg/L. This AMD is therefore an excellent model site to examine extreme microbial environments and has been the focal point of a suite of studies [<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Bacteria belonging to the genus <italic>Thiomonas</italic> are found ubiquitously at AMD sites and several strains (including CB1, CB2, CB3, CB6 and 3As), have been isolated from the Carnoul&#x000e8;s AMD [<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These facultative chemolithoautotrophic betaproteobacteria are able to use reduced inorganic sulfur compounds (RISCs) as electron donors. <italic>Tm</italic>. <italic>delicata</italic> (previously <italic>Tm</italic>. <italic>arsenivorans</italic> b6) is capable of autotrophic growth while <italic>Tm</italic>. spp. CB1, CB2, CB3 and CB6 survive only in the presence of organic carbon sources [<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Using Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH), our previous work demonstrated that <italic>Thiomonas</italic> genomes have been shaped by the acquisition and loss of GEIs, which may have helped strains adapt to different niches within the AMD [<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. While it was possible to detect GEIs and uncover evidence of HGT using the CGH approach, forces that lead to bacterial adaptation in toxic environments are not thoroughly understood. The genome of two <italic>Thiomonas</italic> strains, <italic>Thiomonas arsenitoxydans</italic> 3As (3As) isolated from the Carnoul&#x000e8;s AMD [<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and <italic>Thiomonas</italic>. <italic>intermedia</italic> K12 (K12) isolated from sewage pipes [<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.jgi-psf.org/thiin/thiin.info.html">http://genome.jgi-psf.org/thiin/thiin.info.html</ext-link>) are available in public databases and provided the initial glimpse into the genetic capacity of these <italic>Thiomonas</italic> strains. In particular, <italic>Tm</italic>. <italic>intermedia</italic> K12 has not been well studied and, to our knowledge, its phylogenetic relationship with other characterized <italic>Thiomonas</italic> strains, in particular with the <italic>Tm</italic>. <italic>arsenitoxydans</italic> strain 3As was never analyzed. The DNA-DNA hybridization values proposed suggest that while it clearly belongs to a different species, 3As is genetically related to the <italic>Tm</italic>. <italic>intermedia</italic> strain, DSM 18155 [<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The isolates designated as 3As, CB1, CB2, CB3 and CB6 are phylogenetically related and share more than 99% sequence ID according to the 16S rRNA [<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Despite their relatedness, these isolates each have unique metabolic capacities [<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], thus representing an ideal model system to analyze bacterial genomic divergence in extreme and polluted environments on a fine evolutionary scale.</p><p>In this study, we sequenced the genome of strain CB2, and optimized the assembly in order to compare this genome&#x02019;s architecture to that of 3As and K12. Our results revealed that the CB2 genome was subject to rearrangement and contains genomic islands involved in heavy metal transformation and resistance. Second, we sequenced the genomes of additional five <italic>Thiomonas</italic> strains isolated from AMD and we compared those draft genomes with the genomes of CB2, 3As and K12. This revealed that the <italic>Thiomonas</italic> strains that originated from the AMD have adapted to an extremely hazardous habitat by maintaining specific GEIs that confer As resistance as well as the capacity to oxidize arsenite.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Bacterial cultivation and growth conditions</title><p>In this study, the strains <italic>Thiomonas</italic> spp. ACO3, ACO7 were isolated on R2A agar medium (BD Difco) after 7 days of incubation at 30&#x000ba;C from sediments collected at the Carnoul&#x000e8;s AMD after being processed on a Nycodenz gradient as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

After 24 hours of unimpeded growth, As(III) was added from a sterile stock to a final concentration of 3 mM. Uninoculated flasks with the respective media served as abiotic controls.

Standards of inorganic As(III) and As(V) were used for calibration throughout all experiments. In a second set of experiments, three independent 25 mL cultures of m126 supplemented with 1.33 mM of As(III) were inoculated with CB1, CB2, CB3, CB6, K12 or 3As to an OD<sub>600</sub> ~ 0.002.

Five scaffolds could not be mapped precisely to the genome: two were too small (5 and 2.4 kb) to be assembled according to the optical map, and the other three (20.9, 10.8 and 7.9 kb) likely correspond to plasmid DNA as is indicated by the presence of <italic>mob</italic> and <italic>par</italic> genes which are involved in plasmid mobilization, replication, and stabilization [<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].

Nevertheless, this did not allow for the comparison of genomic synteny or to detect if the genomes shared similar architectures.

The 3As and K12 genomes shared five and four distinct GEIs with CB2, respectively, while only two islands (RGP1 and 13) were found in all three genomes. Interestingly, genes found in RGP7 and a large part of RGP19 of CB2 were present in all other AMD strains (CB1, CB3, CB6, 3As, ACO3, and ACO7) but not in K12, suggesting that these two islands were most likely important for survival in AMD. The RGP7 contains almost exclusively proteins of unknown function, while RGP19 carries genes involved in As resistance and transformation (<xref rid="pone.0139011.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>) and was further analyzed in detail.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Detailed analysis of the <italic>ars</italic> and <italic>aio</italic> genes of CB2, involved in As metabolism</title><p>Microbial mechanisms to mitigate the toxic effects of As include the expression of <italic>ars</italic> genes, which encode an arsenite (As(III)) efflux pump (<italic>arsB</italic>) and an arsenate (As(V)) reductase (<italic>arsC</italic>) and allow bacteria to reduce arsenate to arsenite in order to ultimately extrude it from the cell [<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These genes are usually present as a three-gene operon, <italic>arsRBC</italic>, with <italic>arsR</italic> encoding a transcriptional regulator, or an extended five-gene operon <italic>arsRDABC</italic>, with <italic>arsA</italic> encoding an ATPase involved in As(III) extrusion, and <italic>arsD</italic> encoding an arsenite chaperone that transfers arsenite from glutathione-bound complexes to the ArsA subunit of the ArsAB complex. The <italic>arsA</italic> and <italic>arsD</italic> genes supposedly confer higher levels of resistance [<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Another mechanism of As resistance involves the <italic>aio</italic> operon that encodes proteins involved in detoxifying arsenite by oxidizing As(III) to arsenate As(V) or utilizing As(III) as an electron donor [<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>The CB2, K12, and 3As <italic>Thiomonas</italic> genomes harbor an <italic>arsRICB</italic> operon, sharing more than 97% of similarity at the nucleotide level, that is not located in a GEI but in a very conserved region of these three genomes. Both CB2 and 3As have an additional <italic>arsRDACB</italic> operon with a shared 91% identity at the nucleotide level, located in a GEI in both genomes. In CB2, this operon is found on RGP19, directly upstream from an <italic>aio</italic> locus, while in 3As, it is located on The ThGEI-O described previously [<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In CB2, two versions of the <italic>aio</italic> operon, sharing less than 90% identity at the nucleotide level, are located in two distinct GEIs (referred to from now on as &#x0201c;arsenic genomic islands&#x0201d;) (<xref rid="pone.0139011.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). One copy is encoded in RGP19 of CB2, while the second is located in RGP10. In contrast, a single <italic>aio</italic> operon is found in 3As [<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and in K12 (this work). The CB2 AioA and AioB proteins encoded by the operon located on RGP19 both share 100% identity with the proteins encoded by 3As, and 84% and 88% identity with those of K12, respectively (<xref rid="pone.0139011.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, the AioA and AioB encoded by the operon on RGP10 share 82% and 89% identity with the 3As proteins and 87% and 98% identity with those of K12 (<xref rid="pone.0139011.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0139011.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These observations revealed than one copy of the <italic>aio</italic> locus and associated genes of CB2 (located on RGP19), were more related to those in 3As, whereas the second copy of the <italic>aio</italic> and associated genes in CB2 (located on RGP10), were more related to those found in the unique <italic>aio</italic> locus of K12 (<xref rid="pone.0139011.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0139011.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0139011.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). To test if the genes are functional in CB2, we assessed the extent of As(III) oxidation, and found that more than 60% of As(III) was oxidized to As(V) within 48 h, followed by a slow reduction of As(V) during the stationary growth phase (<xref rid="pone.0139011.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). In other <italic>Thiomonas</italic> isolates, where arsenite oxidation is involved in energy production, this activity was reduced in the presence of a preferred substrate. In our work, the addition of glucose to m126 caused a severe inhibition of As(III) oxidation in CB2 (<xref rid="pone.0139011.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>), suggesting that CB2 may use either arsenite or glucose as an electron donor and the inhibition of the arsenite oxidation could be due to a catabolite repression. Finally, we investigated if both copies of the <italic>aio</italic> genes were expressed in two growth conditions. First, RNAseq was performed on cells grown in conditions favoring biofilm formation (without shaking) and revealed that the expression of the <italic>ars</italic> and the <italic>aio</italic> genes (two copies of each operon), and also other genes from these two islands, are induced by As(III) (<xref rid="pone.0139011.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). Second, a Western blot was performed to determine if both copies were synthetized during aerobic growth. In shaken liquid cultures, we observed that indeed, the two <italic>aioA</italic> genes were expressed only in the presence of As(III) (<xref rid="pone.0139011.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>), as was found previously in 3As [<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

In fact, many integrases are also located on RGP19, as well as genes involved in conjugation, including phage integrase and relaxase. 49 bp nearly perfect direct repeats are located at the left extremity of RGP19 and between gene THICB2v3-780013 and -780014, and the region between these two repeats contains <italic>tra</italic> and <italic>trb</italic> genes involved in conjugation (<xref rid="pone.0139011.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>).

All these observations emphasized the fact that this region has been acquired after insertion and is or, at some point, was mobile. Consequently, this part of RGP19 (from 3533461 to 3796598, 185,5 Kb) has the characteristics of an integrative and conjugative element (ICE) [<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and has been designated ICE19 and the repeats designed <italic>attL</italic> and <italic>attR</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0139011.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>).

Interestingly, similar repeats are also found in the ICE19 of CB2, although one is slightly different, perhaps due to punctual mutations occurred after the insertion or rearrangement of genes in this region (<xref rid="pone.0139011.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>).

In CB2, an additional region was identified that is not harbored by K12, which includes genes encoding transposases, integrases, and proteins of unknown function.

Interestingly, multiple copies of the <italic>aio/ars</italic> genes were in some strains (<xref rid="pone.0139011.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>).

A Western blot revealed that only one copy is indeed expressed in CB1, CB6, ACO3, and ACO7 strains with a similar apparent molecular weight when grown in the presence of arsenite (<xref rid="pone.0139011.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3C Fig</xref>). Interestingly, the genome of the CB3 strain contains five copies of the <italic>ars</italic> genes as well as four copies of the <italic>aio</italic> loci, which were clearly located on different contigs. The <italic>aio</italic> genes in CB2 RGP19 were identified in 3 copies in CB3 (<xref rid="pone.0139011.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>); however, one <italic>aio</italic> cluster was only partially intact (only one <italic>aioA</italic> fragment and no <italic>aioB</italic>) and found on a short scaffold. Interestingly, at least two copies of <italic>aioA</italic> were expressed in the presence of arsenite in CB3 and the proteins migrated similarly to the two CB2 AioA proteins (<xref rid="pone.0139011.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3C Fig</xref>).

It has to be mentioned that this synteny analysis was limited by the scaffolds limits in each of the draft genomes. Indeed, the synteny of the entire CB2 RGP was occasionally not clarified in other genomes since the scaffold organization could not be deciphered. Nevertheless, this analysis revealed that in all strains, the synteny of the <italic>aio</italic>/<italic>ars</italic> genes was conserved (<xref rid="pone.0139011.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>), whereas the synteny of the other genes from these islands was not (<xref rid="pone.0139011.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). These observations further support the hypothesis that these two arsenic islands have evolved differently in these <italic>Thiomonas</italic> strains through multiple genomic rearrangements or HGT.</p><p>Finally, we investigated if the number of <italic>aio</italic> and <italic>ars</italic> genes influenced resistance to As(III) and its oxidation efficiency in <italic>Thiomonas</italic> strains. The MIC for As(III) was previously determined in liquid culture, however, in this study we tested the As(III) resistance on solid media with a narrow range of As(III) concentrations. We observed that the CB2 and CB3 strains are slightly more resistant than K12, ACO3, and ACO7 while the strains 3As, CB1, and CB6 demonstrated the lowest levels of As(III) resistance (<xref rid="pone.0139011.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>). We also determined if the kinetics of As(III) oxidation to As(V) were similar in all these strains by measuring the As(III) and As(V) concentrations over 120 h (<xref rid="pone.0139011.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). The As(III) oxidation activity of K12 was lower compared to the strains isolated from the AMD strains (CB1, CB2, CB3, CB6 and 3As). No dramatic difference in the As(III) oxidation was observed between the AMD strains suggesting that despite several copies of <italic>aio</italic> genes, CB2 and CB3 did not oxidize As(III) more rapidly than the other strains, this activity was even slightly slower in CB2. In contrast, once the As(III) was completely oxidized, As(V) was then reduced in 3As, CB1, and CB6. Such As(V) reduction activity was not observed in CB2 or CB3 in 1.3 mM As(III). These results suggest that arsenate reduction is either less efficient or that As(III) oxidation activity is maintained for a longer time period in these two strains. Altogether, these data revealed that in relation to the genes involved in As metabolism, the As(III) resistance and oxidation capacities are different between these closely related strains.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Discussion</title><p>With the growing number of genome sequences available, it is now possible to utilize comparative tools to understand adaptations that microorganisms have acquired in diverse environments. Here, we compared the CB2 genome to that in other <italic>Thiomonas</italic> strains, including two complete (3As and K12) and five draft (ACO3, ACO7, CB1, CB3 and CB6) genomes. These isolates, as well as CB2 and 3As, were isolated from an AMD rich in toxic metals ([<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and this work), while K12 was originally obtained from a sewer in Hamburg, an environment not known for high As concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The genetic relatedness of K12 with other <italic>Thiomonas</italic> strains has never been analyzed previously. Here, a detailed phylogenetic analysis was completed that demonstrated that 3As, CB1, CB6, ACO3, and ACO7 are very closely related and clade with CB3 and CB2, while the K12 strain clearly diverges from this group.</p><p>CB1, CB6, 3As, ACO3, and ACO7 expressed only one copy of the <italic>aio</italic> genes, while CB2 and CB3 have two or more copies which are expressed, each likely playing a role in As tolerance and metabolism. To date, the Carnoul&#x000e8;s AMD, which is highly contaminated with As(III), is the only location that has yielded isolates with multiple copies of the <italic>aio</italic> operon. Expressing two <italic>aio</italic> operons may allow CB2 and CB3 strains to maintain arsenite oxidation activity for a longer time period, as suggested by the results we&#x02019;ve obtained in this study, ultimately allowing these strains to be slightly more resistant to As(III) than the others assessed.</p><p>Due to a robust assembly, the comparison among K12, CB2, and 3As allowed us to define essential GEIs, which might be important for survival in AMD. In CB2, we described 20 GEIs, while 30 were found in 3As ([<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and this work). Genes found in only two GEIs were shared between all the isolates from AMD strains but not in K12, revealing that there is not a large pool of AMD-specific genes in <italic>Thiomonas</italic> strains from the Carnoul&#x000e8;s AMD. In fact, our data demonstrated that the <italic>Thiomonas</italic> genomes are variable, due to the presence, expansion (possibly via gene duplication and/or HGT), or absence of several GEIs. In addition, several <italic>Thiomonas</italic> strains have at least one plasmid. Remarkably, the size and content of the plasmids found in the strains analyzed here are variable and the functions they encoded were different and may be specific to some strains. Thus, a large portion of the genome in these strains may confer different ecological capacities and functions, acting as a flexible region influencing gene content diversity and suggesting that they adapt differently to their niches. Finally, the K12 genome (3, 467 genes) is smaller than the others (which range from 3, 628 to 4, 508 genes) possibly indicating its native environment requires fewer genes for survival. Additionally, we found a larger number of CDS with unknown functions in the AMD strains, in particular in RGP7, which is found in all the strains isolated from AMD. It may be possible that these genes confer specific capacities not yet characterized, which could allow for survival in AMD.</p><p>Our comparative analyses revealed that the CB2 chromosome has a unique architecture in comparison to 3As and K12. Surprisingly, the 3As genome structure was more similar to K12, possibly indicating that the CB2 genome underwent specific genomic events, exemplified by three major inversions and rearrangements compared to 3As. Furthermore, some CB2 GEIs appear to contain multiple islands, most likely acquired after the divergence of this strain. Some of these GEIs, in particular the ICE19 possibly allowing for survival in the harsh AMD environment may have been acquired by HGT [<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].

Indeed CB2 forms biofilms, which are stimulated in the presence of arsenic [<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which may have played a role in the acquisition of exogenous DNA. Previous work demonstrated genetic exchange is more common between closely related organisms [<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], thus <italic>Thiomonas</italic> sp. could potentially transfer the portions of the GEIs that confer a selective survival advantage to other <italic>Thiomonas</italic> strains. Our data and a recent analysis of GEIs involved in As metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] suggest that both vertical inheritance and HGT favor the spread of such <italic>aio/ars</italic> genes. Thus, rearrangement, HGT and gene loss events probably impacted CB2 genome content after strain divergence, leading to the formation of similar but not identical composite GEIs. In particular, the arsenic islands may have been modified by HGT or rearrangement processes, since it appears that the gene content of these islands is similar but not identical in <italic>Thiomonas</italic> strains.</p><p>The analysis of the <italic>Thiomonas</italic> genomes is a step towards understanding environmental pressures on genome evolution. The high frequency of modifications within these sequences possibly depicts the first phase in the creation of novel species and the extinction of others [<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Readily shuffling DNA allows microbial community members to sample the environment for potentially beneficial genes, which has implications in both community diversity and strain-specific lineage survival [<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0139011.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Our results clearly demonstrate the importance of genomic islands in <italic>Thiomonas</italic> adaptation. These islands allow organisms to inhabit diverse environments by providing genomic plasticity and the rapid acquisition of functional traits. In the case of <italic>Thiomonas</italic>, the environment appears to have played an important role in driving the acquisition of genomic islands, and is possibly the source of selective pressures leading to rearrangements and HGT. Therefore, in order to obtain a detailed understanding of bacterial adaptation, speciation, and evolution, as well as to delineate lineages, a holistic view taking into account bacterial species as well as traditional metrics needs to be adopted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0139011.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Plasmid detection and visualization in CB1, CB2, CB3, CB6, 3As, and K12 <italic>Thiomonas</italic> strains in agarose gels after ethidium bromide staining.</title><p>K3: the 3 plasmids from <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> with estimated sizes of 225 kb, 130 kb and 45 kb.
