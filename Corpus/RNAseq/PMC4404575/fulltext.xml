This in turn is responsible for the periodic outburst of genetic defects that cause considerable economic loss and welfare issues. With the development of genome-wide SNP arrays for all livestock species, it has become possible to rapidly map the underlying locus by means of autozygosity mapping to intervals that typically span 2 to 5 megabases thereby proving the inherited nature and mode of inheritance of the corresponding condition (f.i. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]). With the advent of targeted or whole-genome next generation sequencing (NGS), it is becoming increasingly facile to identify the causative mutation, needed to develop accurate diagnostic tests, provided that the mutation is a frame-shift, nonsense, canonical splice-site, or severe missense variant. In other cases, the causative mutation may remain elusive for a considerably longer time. We show in this work how the combined use of DNA and RNA NGS data, may accelerate the discovery of an otherwise elusive, novel class of causative mutations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Arthrogryposis emerges as a new genetic defect in Belgian Blue Cattle</title><p>We recently established an &#x0201c;heredo-surveillance platform&#x0201d; to effectively identify and control inherited defects that recurrently emerge as a result of intensive use of elite sires in Belgian Blue and other cattle breeds (f.i.

Affected calves were all characterized by arthrogryposis (hooked joints) of the four limbs, severe scoliosis (curved spine), and a stocky head with macroglossy and impaired tooth eruption. A majority of cases suffered from cleft palate (20/25) and upper lip (3/25), omphalocele (abdominal wall defect with umbilical hernia; 19/25) and corneal clouding (21/25) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

We therefore genotyped 15 cases with the bovine SNP50 beadchip (Illumina, San Diego) to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS). We used the genotypes from 275 Belgian Blue AI sires, obtained with the bovine HD (700&#x000a0;K) beadchip (Illumina, San Diego), as controls. The analysis was restricted to 34,368 SNPs shared by both arrays, and conducted with GLASCOW as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].

To pursue this hypothesis, we took advantage of available RNASeq data (cfr. M&#x00026;M) from liver (83&#x000a0;Mb uniquely aligned) and cerebral cortex (105&#x000a0;Mb) of a 60-day post fertilization Belgian Blue fetus shown by SNP genotyping to carry the arthrogryposis risk haplotype. Sequence reads were analyzed using TopHat and Cufflinks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and predicted transcripts mapping to the arthrogryposis locus visualized in the IGV browser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].

While we obtained a unique band of expected 593-bp size for the control, the only band obtained from the case RNA was 377~bp (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Sequencing of the corresponding RT-PCR products revealed the expected <italic>PIGH</italic> exon 1-2-3 sequence for the controls, yet two distinct sequences for the case. The most abundant (~75%) form corresponded to the skipping of exon 2, while the minor (~25%) form was - in addition to missing exon 2 &#x02013; devoid of the first AAG triplet of exon 3 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]). Within the GPI-GlcNAc transferase complex (GPI-GnT), PIGH is anchored in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by two trans-membrane helices (residues 38&#x02013;55 and 60&#x02013;78), connected by a short ER intra-luminal loop (56&#x02013;59), and bounded by a short N-terminal (1&#x02013;37) and a long C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (79&#x02013;188) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Deleting exon 2 generates a protein missing amino-acids 61&#x02013;130, therefore unlikely to be properly anchored in the ER membrane and to be functional (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). In culture, cells with mutations in <italic>PIGH</italic> do not display any GPI-anchored protein (GPI-AP) surface expression (f.i. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]). In animals, all known GPI-anchor related defects characterized by a complete lack of GPI-anchored proteins are lethal for the embryo. It is thought that this embryonic-lethal phenotype is due to the fact that several cell-to-cell adhesion molecules required for normal development and acting at specific developmental stages are GPI-anchored (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]). The additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref> lists the known GPI-AP and their associated knock-out phenotype in mice.

We mapped the corresponding locus by performing a haplotype-based GWAS, an approach that has proven successful in many instances (f.i. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]). If the causative mutation is either a stop-gain, frameshift, splice-site variant within 2-bp from an exon-intron boundary, or a severe missense variant, its identification is often relatively straightforward. In our experience, this situation occurs approximately fifty percent of the time, which is in agreement with the data reported by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In the other cases, the identification of the causative mutation may be considerably more arduous. In the present study, it was the concomitant generation of RNASeq data from tissue of a carrier animal that provided the clues for the identification of the causative mutation. The detection of exon skipping in an essential gene that was not observed in non-carrier animals pointed towards one of 31 genetically defined mutations (located in the immediate vicinity of the skipped exon) as being the likely causative mutation. It would have been very difficult to predict the effect of this variant, located at 10-bp from the exon-intron junction, on the splicing reaction without the information on the corresponding transcripts. Our work therefore illustrates the value of the combined availability of DNA and RNASeq data to rapidly identify a broader panel of disease causing mutations.</p><p>Although we consider the supporting evidence to be very strong, we haven&#x02019;t formally proven that skipping of exon 2 of the <italic>PIGH</italic> gene abrogates its function and interferes with GPI-anchor biosynthesis. In human and mice, functional validation of GPI biosynthesis pathway&#x02019;s defects relies on the detection of incomplete or absent cell surface expression of CD59, a well-characterized GPI-anchored protein (f.i. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]). This quantification is typically performed by FACS on fresh erythrocytes. Unfortunately, homozygous mutant calves are dead at birth, precluding the collection of fresh blood.

Amplicons were directly sequenced using the Big Dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Electrophoresis of purified sequencing reactions was performed on an ABI PRISM 3730 DNA analyzer (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
