We develop advanced data integration methods for multi-level analysis of genomic, transcriptomic, ribosomal profiling, proteomic and fluxomic data. First, we show that pairwise integration of primary omics data reveals regularities that tie cellular processes together in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>: the number of protein molecules made per mRNA transcript and the number of ribosomes required per translated protein molecule. Second, we show that genome-scale models, based on genomic and bibliomic data, enable quantitative synchronization of disparate data types. Integrating omics data with models enabled the discovery of two novel regularities: condition invariant <italic>in vivo</italic> turnover rates of enzymes and the correlation of protein structural motifs and translational pausing. These regularities can be formally represented in a computable format allowing for coherent interpretation and prediction of fitness and selection that underlies cellular physiology.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

Owing to large-scale improvements in omics technologies, we can now quantitatively track changes in biological processes in unprecedented detail<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Although such measurements span a diverse range of cellular activities, developing an understanding of how these data types quantitatively relate to one another and to the phenotypic characteristics of the organism remains elusive. This issue is central to the so-called Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) grand challenge, which aims to integrate multiple disparate data types into a biologically meaningful, multi-level structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.</p><p>Interpretation of disparate data requires understanding how the primary measurements of different omics data are quantitatively coupled to one another<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. We approach this task by identifying regularities (relationships between biological data types that remain relatively constant across conditions) between pairwise omics data types. Although some regularities can readily be discovered through direct pairwise omics data comparisons, we find that other regularities emerge only through more intricate analysis leveraged by mechanistically based network reconstructions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Such reconstructions can be used as a context for poly-omic data integration and analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, and, when combined with constraint-based modelling approaches<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, provide important links between omics data and phenotypic characteristics of the organism.</p><p>As we will show, this approach leads to a comprehensive synchronization of poly-omic data with computed growth states. The approach directly addresses the BD2K grand challenge and is made conceptually accessible by tracing the &#x02018;information flow' through the familiar &#x02018;central dogma', to establish relationships between measurements and cell physiology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Pairwise ratios of data types are highly correlated</title><p>First, we examine the information flow from transcription to translation, to protein production, by identifying correlations across primary omics data types, such as RNAseq<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, ribosome profiling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> and proteomics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, collected for <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> batch growth on glucose, fumarate, pyruvate and acetate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, &#x02018;primary data box'). We found relatively poor correlations of messenger RNA to protein across conditions (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x0003c;0.4), consistent with previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Stronger correlations (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x0003e;0.8) emerge when analysing the ratio of protein per mRNA (<italic>&#x003c1;</italic><sub>PM</sub>) on a per-gene basis (the difference between peptide abundance and relative mRNA read counts per gene for multiple growth conditions; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Computing the median coefficient of variation shows that changes in <italic>&#x003c1;</italic><sub>PM</sub> across conditions are relatively invariant. In addition, we find the number of ribosomes required (ribosome occupancy of mRNA) per protein translated is also relatively invariant across all four conditions (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x0003e;0.7; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Translation rate is linked to protein secondary structure</title><p>Second, we examined pairwise relationships between other omics data types, such as ribosome profiling, proteomics and fluxomics, by integrating these data types into next-generation genome-scale models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, &#x02018;integration with genome-scale models of metabolism (GEMs) box'). GEMs are based on the annotated sequence and analysis of the bibliome for functionally annotated gene products<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. The most recent generations of genome-scale models incorporate protein structural information<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> and allow for the computation of the synthesis of the entire proteome of a cell in addition to the balanced use of its metabolic network<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. These models can integrate multiple layers of biological organization to balance the use of all cellular components, to achieve a cellular state. It can thus extend our understanding of how information flows from translation to protein folding and catalysis, and its role in producing whole-cell functions.</p><p>We examined how information flows during protein translation, which includes protein folding. Recent studies indicate a possible link between translation speed and proper folding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Analysis of translational pausing has typically been approached from a sequence-based viewpoint<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Here we approach this analysis from a different perspective, by correlating the occurrence of translational pausing on a transcript to the location of nearby protein secondary (2&#x000b0;) structure motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). The establishment of this correlation is based on the following: (1) ribosome profiling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, which provides ample information on the queuing of ribosomes along mRNA transcripts; and (2) a recent network reconstruction that contains comprehensive protein structural information linked to the translated protein at the proteome scale<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.</p><p>Several striking regularities in translational pausing and protein structure are consistently observed across multiple growth conditions in <italic>E. coli</italic>, which suggest the co-translational folding of intermediate secondary structure motifs inside the ribosome exit tunnel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). We find that pause sites are enriched (<italic>p</italic>-value&#x0003c;0.01 using a hypergeometric test) downstream of specific secondary structure motifs, such as &#x003b1;-helices and &#x003b2;-sheets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), yet are not significantly enriched at the termini of domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref> and also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>). On average, pausing becomes most substantial six to eight amino acids downstream of &#x003b1;-helices and &#x003b2;-sheets, which, in the majority of cases, fall either on disordered regions of the protein or on helical residues. Such instances consistently account for &#x0003e;35&#x02013;40&#x00025; of pause sites across different conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). These findings strongly corroborate a growing theory that partially folded intermediate protein structures begin to immediately fold inside the ribosome exit tunnel, following polypeptide-chain synthesis. Several previous studies have shown that partially folded protein structures, such as small domains, can be detected within the exit tunnel<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. More recently, Nilsson <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> demonstrated the co-translational folding of a small zinc finger-like domain deep within the ribosome exit tunnel using arrest-peptide-mediated force measurements in conjunction with cryo-electron tomography.</p><p>Do sequence-specific motifs drive co-translational pausing to ensure proper protein folding? We find that Shine&#x02013;Dalgarno (SD)-like sequences account for 20&#x02013;22&#x00025; of ribosome density at pause sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref> and see &#x02018;Identification of SD-like codons' in Methods), which is consistent with recent studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, and four times less frequent than what is found previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Of the pausing instances linked to SD-like sequences, we find that, on average, nearly half of these pausing regions also fall in the nearby vicinity (five to ten codons) of helices or sheets. The link between pausing, SD-like sequence and protein secondary structure becomes clear when comparing the average occurrence of SD-like sequences genome-wide (9&#x00025;) with their occurrence directly downstream of &#x003b1;-helices (35&#x00025;) and &#x003b2;-sheets (18&#x00025;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Together, these sequence and structure motifs account for the majority of pause sites (60&#x00025;) or nearly half of the total ribosome occupancy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). These findings suggest that co-translational pausing occurs for distinct secondary structural elements and supports the potential role of sequence-specific factors to drive pausing for ensuring proper protein folding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Genome-wide estimation of enzyme turnover rates</title><p>How does information flow between an individual enzyme's catalytic activity and the activity of an entire network? To evaluate the effective turnover rate of enzymes, reaction flux per enzyme can be directly computed using experimental values for both flux (the rate of reactions) and enzyme abundance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> on a small scale (mainly for central carbon metabolism). To assess enzyme turnover on a genome scale, we computed the ratio of an enzyme's abundance (measured from proteomics data) and its corresponding flux derived from network-based analyses using the <italic>i</italic>OL1650-ME model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). As the <italic>i</italic>OL1650-ME model directly relates enzyme synthesis and metabolic flux, we were able to develop a method, which uses the model to extrapolate the most probable flux state from proteomics. These ratios quantitatively couple experimentally derived flux estimates and protein abundances to make a quantitative connection between data types.</p><p>Estimates of enzyme turnover rates (<italic>k</italic><sub>eff</sub>), which represent coupling coefficients between the fluxome and the proteome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 3</xref>), were analysed across four nutrient conditions, to understand the effect that carbon uptake has on metabolic enzyme turnover rates. We find that these parameters show considerable regularity in relating flux to protein abundance, which suggests that <italic>in vivo</italic> turnover rate for most enzymes does not strongly depend on growth in diverse batch culture settings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 4</xref>). For high-flux metabolic reactions, the estimated turnover rates were consistent across all four conditions (a total of 284 turnover rate values; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), with high correlation between any two conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). The computed turnover rates were averaged across experimental conditions to give the largest set of flux-per-enzyme parameters estimated computationally to date under <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions. It is important to note that these estimated turnover rates do not have a direct relationship with fundamental enzyme kinetic parameters obtained <italic>in vitro</italic> but can be viewed as an <italic>in vivo</italic> data-driven estimate of the enzyme turnover rate.</p><p>Although these correlations provide information about relationships between biological components and, in some cases, take on predictive value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>), understanding their collective influence on cell physiology is harder to decipher. This issue can be addressed using a genome-scale model that assesses cost-benefit tradeoffs from a cell-centric perspective<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Genome-scale models (<italic>i</italic>OL1650-ME) compute the value of cellular components relative to the function of all other cellular components. To this end, the turnover rate values provide the minimum &#x02018;capital expenditure' for protein synthesis required to achieve a unit of flux through a given reaction. Thus, as a group, the calculated turnover rates provide coupling between proteome allocation and achievement of a physiological state.</p><p>The knowledge of the biological regularities identified in this work enables the parameterization of coupling constraints used in a genome-scale model of metabolism and gene expression metabolism and gene expression (ME). A parameterized model allows for prediction of responses to environmental perturbations. We tested the predictive capacity of a model containing parameter values derived from multiple conditions described above, to compute optimal cellular composition under new environmental conditions where proteomics data was not available. In simulations with our parametrized model, we perturbed a reference growth state through the addition of nutrients to the medium: batch growth on glucose was supplemented with adenine, glycine, tryptophan or threonine. From these predicted phenotypic states, we identified enzymes that were predicted to be differentially used in the supplemented condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b,c</xref>). To validate these predictions, we collected omics data sets under these four perturbed conditions, to compare gene expression changes with the computated responses.</p><p>When validating our predictions using experimentally measured differential gene expression, we find our prediction accuracies of differential gene expression range between 56 and 100&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>), and are significantly enriched for experimentally differential genes, with <italic>p</italic>-values ranging from 0.04 to 4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> using a hypergeometric test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Therefore, using the parameterized model, we are able to improve the prediction of gene regulation that accompanies changes in growth environment. For example, a nutrient supplementation will often cause non-intuitive shifts in what precursors the cell uses to synthesize amino acid molecules. The parameterized ME model correctly identifies the production/non-production of <sc>L</sc>-serine from supplemented <sc>L</sc>-threonine and glycine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 5</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>The unprecedented growth in the type, size and complexity of biological data sets over the past couple of decades has led to a pressing grand challenge in biology referred to as BD2K. In this study, we address this critical need through the development of advanced data integration methods to enable multi-level analysis of genomic, transcriptomic, ribosomal profiling, proteomic and fluxomic data across multiple experimental conditions. We can show that pairwise integration of primary omics data reveal unknown biological regularities that quantitatively tie key cellular processes together, and that genome-scale models enable the quantitative synchronization of disparate omics data types, leading to the discovery of additional system-based novel regularities. For example, when directly compared, RNA and protein values have long been known to be poorly correlated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. However, the integration of ribosome profiling and structural data demonstrates how the secondary structures in proteins correlate with sites of translational pausing, supporting the theory of co-translational folding and the rhythm of translation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>). The variation in translation observed from multiple omics types sheds light on how the protein-per-RNA ratio is correlated for each gene across conditions, but poorly correlated across genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.</p><p>By designing algorithms to integrate omic data with genome-scale networks, the ability to predict differential gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>) emerges. On the most basic level, a genome-scale model of metabolism informs the user of all possible metabolic reactions and their respective stoichiometries<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. The previous unparameterized ME model of <italic>E. coli</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> added an additional reconstruction of gene and protein expression networks, and their associated metabolic costs. Here, we integrate omics data directly by using a parameterization algorithm to improve estimates of expression costs. We can demonstrate the increased accuracy of the parameterized ME model compared with the previous unparameterized ME model and M-model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, we have shown that fundamental contextualization of multi-omic data leads to (i) insights into underlying biological mechanisms during protein translation and (ii) predictive computations based on cellular-econometric cost-benefit ratios associated with cellular functions. Thus, both multi-omic data analysis and genome-scale models will play an important role in establishing big data analysis frameworks to explain and predict cellular physiology.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ribosome profiling</title><p>To compute the ribosome per protein ratios, <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 cells were grown in glucose (5&#x02009;g&#x02009;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), pyruate (sodium pyruvate 3.3&#x02009;g&#x02009;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), fumarate (disodium fumarate 2.8&#x02009;g&#x02009;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and acetate (sodium acetate, 3.5&#x02009;g&#x02009;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>).

Although using solvent accessible surface area (SASA) as a first approximation results in a correct overall prediction of 80&#x00025; of the cell proteome by mass, improving these parameters can greatly affect the predictive power of the model for specific genes.

Two small modifications were made to the model for adenine, which initially had an accuracy of only 26.2&#x00025; due to the genes used for adenine degradation in the model, which are not expressed and may not be functional (for details, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). The numbers provided in the correct column are the number of genes, which are predicted to be differentially expressed and also are differentially expressed in the same direction in the RNA sequencing data. The number in parenthesis refers to the number of correctly predicted differentially expressed genes which are still expressed under both conditions but varied in their predicted quantitative values. The incorrect column contains the number of genes predicted to be differentially expressed which were not in the model. These numbers are used to predict the percent accuracy and the <italic>p</italic>-value for a hypergeometric enrichment of differentially expressed genes in the predicted set.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></floats-group></article>
