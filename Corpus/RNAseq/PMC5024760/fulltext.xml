Recently, ribosome profiling became the state-of-the-art method to quantitatively characterize translation dynamics at a transcriptome-wide level. However, the strategy of library generation affects its outcomes. Here, we present a modified ribosome-profiling protocol starting from yeast, human cells and vertebrate brain tissue. We use a DNA linker carrying four randomized positions at its 5&#x02032; end and a reverse-transcription (RT) primer with three randomized positions to reduce artifacts during library preparation. The use of seven randomized nucleotides allows to efficiently detect library-generation artifacts. We find that the effect of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) artifacts is relatively small for global analyses when sufficient input material is used. However, when input material is limiting, our strategy improves the sensitivity of gene-specific analyses. Furthermore, randomized nucleotides alleviate the skewed frequency of specific sequences at the 3&#x02032; end of ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs) likely resulting from ligase specificity. Finally, strategies that rely on dual ligation show a high degree of gene-coverage variation. Taken together, our approach helps to remedy two of the main problems associated with ribosome-profiling data. This will facilitate the analysis of translational dynamics and increase our understanding of the influence of RNA modifications on translation.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kg005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Ribosome profiling</kwd><kwd>RNA modification</kwd><kwd>Translation</kwd><kwd>Sequencing bias</kwd><kwd>Codon-translation speed</kwd><kwd>Translational control</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein translation is the most energy-consuming cellular process and lies at the heart of metabolism. The tight regulation of translation and preserving its fidelity is therefore absolutely essential. Interestingly, all major classes of RNA molecules critical for translation contain chemically modified nucleosides that influence translation dynamics <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In particular, transfer RNAs (tRNAs), the adaptor molecules that link the genetic information of the codons to their respective amino acids carry a plethora of modifications affecting tRNA folding, aminoacylation or codon recognition thereby influencing protein synthesis. Modifications of the anticodon loop have been linked to translation and shown to be critical to maintain proteome integrity <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Thus, methods to analyze how modified nucleosides influence global and local translational dynamics are becoming increasingly important. Recently, ribosome profiling has dramatically improved our ability to characterize translation <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The method allows to study transcriptome-wide ribosome dynamics and has been used for the characterization of several complex biological processes <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Ribosome profiling generally relies on the use of translation inhibitors to arrest ribosomes in defined conformations <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Subsequently, the parts of mRNA that are not actively read at the moment of lysis and hence not protected by ribosomes are digested by the addition of nucleases. This digest leads to a strong enrichment of ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs) that can be analyzed by deep sequencing <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Importantly, ribosome profiling more information than just levels of gene translation. Due to the precise mapping of the A- and P-sites, ribosome profiling can accurately provide positional information of translation at sub-codon resolution. This feature has been used to analyze the function of modified tRNA nucleosides from yeast to mice <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Even though its development has sparked huge excitement in fields related to translational control, ribosome profiling is still an emerging technology, which warrants an improvement in its accuracy and sensitivity. The protocol described by Ingolia and coworkers is complex and requires time and experience <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. This has led to various attempts to shorten it or to reduce hands on time by using commercial kits for library preparation (e.g. <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>). Furthermore, recent improvements found sophisticated methods to use less input material, a strategy that needs to be balanced with the necessity to use suboptimal concentrations of material in the enzymatic reactions and to amplify libraries by PCR <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However, not all of these updates were systematically compared to the original protocol and may cause undesirable biases. Here we present a ribosome-profiling protocol that relies on randomized linker and reverse-transcription (RT) primer sequences fully compatible with standard protocols <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> that reduces biases and allows to identify artifacts during downstream bioinformatics analysis. Furthermore, we provide examples of how to funnel different types of input materials, such as yeast, cultured cells or vertebrate tissues into the library-preparation process (see <xref rid="s0115" ref-type="sec">Supplementary protocol for additional information</xref>). Originally, the protocol was optimized for codon-speed analyses as needed in the characterization of tRNA modifications. However, our protocol will be useful for all applications of ribosome profiling with limited amounts of input material.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Protocol</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Library preparation</title><sec id="s0020"><label>2.1.1</label><title>Lysis</title><p>Isolation of intact ribosome-mRNA complexes that accurately represent <italic>in vivo</italic> translation is a critical step during sample preparation.

The offset used to determine the A-site position of a read is based on a characteristic inflection of ribosome occupancy at 12&#x02013;13&#x000a0;nt upstream of annotated start codons. To pinpoint A-site positions we therefore choose positions 15&#x02013;16&#x000a0;nt from the 5&#x02032; end of reads. We select reads mapped to canonical ORFs in the 0 or &#x02212;1 frame, using offsets of 15 and 16&#x000a0;nt respectively. Occupancy of A-site codons is normalized by the frequency of the same codon in the non-decoded +1, +2 and +3 triplets relative to the A-site. In contrast to the &#x02212;1, &#x02212;2 and &#x02212;3 triplets, these codons have not been read by the ribosome. Thus, their frequency is not influenced by ribosome dynamics and reflects codon usage without biases. A script to generate plots of transcriptome-wide A-site codon occupancy (e.g. <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>E) is available upon request.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s0075"><label>3</label><title>Strong biases in dual ligation libraries</title><p>We compared yeast ribosome-profiling libraries generated from isolated RPFs that were further processed by a commercial kit using dual ligation to libraries generated according to the circularization protocol <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> using the same conditions for harvesting, lysis, digestion and isolation of protected fragments but not from the same extract. We noticed uneven coverage of ORFs in the dual-ligation libraries (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>A). This is in agreement with previous reports showing an inherent bias of RNA ligases <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. To assess the extent of this phenomenon, we plotted the standard deviation of codon coverage per transcript after correcting the values according to library size by dividing each value by the sample median of the mean-coverage values per gene, similar to the size-correction method used in the DEseq2 package <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. We observed a higher coverage variation in dual-ligation libraries even after excluding the coverage peak in the first 15 codons of each gene (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>B). To test whether the less even coverage of ribosome-profiling libraries is inherent to the dual-ligation method, we analyzed published ribosome-profiling datasets from yeast <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Indeed, we found that libraries generated by dual-ligation were overall more variable (<xref rid="s0115" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1</xref>). This effect leads to significant differences in the observed translation levels in our libraries. Both library types are clearly separated by their principal components and replicates of dual-ligation libraries were less consistent, while differences between circularization libraries were negligible (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>C). Strikingly, the correlation of average ribosome occupancy between the libraries is &#x0003c;0.9, a poor value for ribosome profiling. We used DESeq2 <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> to compare gene expression between these libraries made from the same yeast strain and lysed according to the same protocol. 881 genes are called as differentially translated arguably based on the library generation protocol (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>D). To test whether codon-occupancy measurements are similarly affected, we determined transcriptome-wide A-site codon occupancy in both libraries (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>E) <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Similar to translation level, in the library constructed by the dual-ligation strategy several codons deviate clearly and exhibit a higher degree of sample-to-sample variation, an effect that is independent of overall codon frequency. This strategy would thus compromise the use of ribosome profiling to study the impact of tRNA modifications on the translation speed of specific codons. Therefore, we do not recommend the use of dual-ligation libraries for codon analysis. Importantly, the original protocol uses cDNA circularization to avoid biases during 5&#x02032; linker ligation <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. This strategy improves the libraries, but potential biases resulting from 3&#x02032; linker ligation remain. Finally, the PCR amplification of cDNA may selectively amplify certain sequences thus distorting the relative abundance of reads <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s0080"><label>4</label><title>A dual randomization strategy for bias prevention and removal</title><p>To be able to detect subtle differences in translation levels and codon occupancy, we sought to reduce library artifacts. In miRNA sequencing, the 5&#x02032; end of the DNA linker was shown to affect ligation efficiency, thereby compromising miRNA quantification <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Randomization of the 5&#x02032; end of the linker circumvents this effect by providing an optimal linker sequence for each target sequence <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. A similar strategy is used in CLIP and CRAC protocols <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Introducing this approach to the generation of ribosome-profiling libraries is more likely to reflect abundance of RPF. Furthermore, randomized nucleotides can be used as barcodes to remove reads that are a result of PCR over-amplification. However, if a specific sequence preferentially ligates to a specific randomized linker sequence, this strategy would mistake the abundance of this RPF as an amplification artifact. To distinguish such cases from PCR over-amplification, we further randomized 3 nucleotides at the 3&#x02032; end of the RT primer. Overall, our strategy introduces seven randomized nucleotides to reduce biases of 3&#x02032; linker ligation and circularization besides identifying and removing PCR duplicates.</p><p>To analyze the effects of randomization on library preparation, we generated RPF and mRNA libraries from two independent yeast extracts. From each replicate, we generated three libraries using different combinations of DNA-linker and RT-primer (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>): First, a commercial non-randomized DNA-linker and the standard RT-primer (fixed linker) <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, second, a DNA-linker randomized at its four most 5&#x02032; positions and the standard RT-primer (randomized linker) and third, a DNA-linker randomized at its four most 5&#x02032; positions and a RT-primer randomized at the last three nucleotides (dual randomization). We did not include dual-ligation in this experiment as this strategy had performed poorly in our comparison.</p></sec><sec id="s0085"><label>5</label><title>Randomization allows duplicate identification</title><p>Duplicate reads can stem from individual ribosomes &#x02013; and thus reflect independent translation events (biological duplicates) &#x02013; or they can stem from artifacts of library preparation (library duplicates). In the mRNA libraries, we found that roughly 80% of the reads were unique using a fixed linker, while 20% scored as duplicates based on multiple reads having identical sequences. It is impossible to distinguish the artifacts among these duplicates from biologically relevant sequences without randomization. The use of randomized linker or dual randomization drastically reduced the occurrence of duplicates (1% and 0.3%), since the reads could be classified with high confidence using the randomized sequences as barcodes.</p><p>However, mRNA samples are approximately 50&#x000a0;nt long, providing ample sequence space to distinguish individual reads. In contrast, RPF reads are only 28&#x02013;30&#x000a0;nt long, complicating their distinction. Indeed, only 25% of all reads were unique using the fixed linker, while 75% were classified as duplicates. Randomized linker and dual randomization reduced the number of reads identified as amplification duplicates to 22% and 5%, respectively. This shows that 7 randomized positions are generally sufficient to distinguish seemingly identical reads and to increase confidence in the data even for short reads.</p></sec><sec id="s0090"><label>6</label><title>Duplicates arise when input material is limiting</title><p>Importantly, because yeast is translationally very active, we started from sufficient input material allowing for optimal reaction conditions during the different steps of the protocol. To assess whether randomization will be more powerful in cases with limited input material e.g. postmitotic vertebrate tissues, we tested the impact of two potential sources of artifacts. First, we performed 10 additional PCR cycles on the cDNA libraries that we had analyzed before, sequenced those and compared the results. This, however, did not change the number of amplification duplicates (data not shown). Second, we tested whether starting from less input material affects the outcome by using 3&#x02013;6 times less input and an additional 20&#x000d7; dilution before library amplification. We found that this increased the number of duplicates in the libraries by up to 57%, based on the replicate and type of linker used (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>B). However, the barcoding through randomized positions allows to identify and to remove the amplification duplicates, which constitute 18&#x02013;48% of the potential duplicate reads. This emphasizes the importance of barcoding to remove the significant number of duplicate reads in many low input ribosome-profiling libraries.</p></sec><sec id="s0095"><label>7</label><title>Randomized linkers alleviate end biases by enhanced fragment ligation</title><p>Next, we analyzed whether certain triplets are more likely to occur in the different high-input, high sequencing-depth libraries and found that the global frequency of triplets correlated well between all datasets (data not shown). Thus, all three strategies perform well in generating a global snapshot of the transcriptome and translatome. To study the influence of randomization on linker-ligation biases, we quantified whether specific triplets are enriched or depleted at the 3&#x02032; end of the reads relative to the rest of the read. This can be critical, since this region of the read is used for normalization of codon occupancy <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. We calculated the frequency of triplets in all positions of the reads and found that the frequency is relatively constant throughout the mRNA reads (<xref rid="s0115" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;2A</xref>), while RPF reads (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>A) show a more diverse composition. This more diverse composition of RPF reads is likely due to their shorter length and the large influence of codons in particular in the A-site of the ribosome on read-composition. However, the frequency at the last position of the reads is most distinct from the word-composition of the overall read and deviates between library types (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>B). We then calculated the distance of each triplet from the ideal correlation and plotted the result for all RPF libraries (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>C) and for all mRNA libraries (<xref rid="s0115" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;2B</xref>). It is apparent that the libraries with randomized linkers perform very similarly. In contrast, in libraries generated with fixed linkers certain words clearly deviate in their end frequency. Among the most striking changes is the underrepresentation of TGC and GTG triplets or rather the larger GTGC, CTGC, TTGC and GGTG 4-mers (<xref rid="s0115" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), which might reflect a ligation bias. When plotting the frequency of each triplet at the end relative to the occurrence of each triplet in the libraries, only very few triplets deviate. Thus, all three circularization strategies lead to valid outcomes if analyzing codon-occupancy on a global level. However, this may differ when analyzing translation of individual genes on a codon-by-codon basis.</p></sec><sec id="s0100"><label>8</label><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Ribosome profiling is a powerful technique to quantitatively analyze the cellular translation landscape in a high-throughput manner <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The methodological improvement that we describe here allows for a more reliable recovery of individual codons. Our protocol will help to further the characterization of translational dynamics by providing a strategy for the generation of high-quality ribosome-profiling libraries from different starting material. In particular, this method proves powerful when input material is limiting, a common situation when working with cell-culture or tissue samples.</p><p>We introduce a total of seven randomized positions to the DNA linker and to the RT primer. The use of randomized nucleotides allows to decrease the overall noise in ribosome-profiling and small RNA datasets via reliable detection and removal of amplification duplicates <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. When performing general gene-translation analysis starting from sufficient material, the use of randomized linkers does not appear to be critical. In these cases the use of the standard circularization protocol achieves sufficient information. Importantly, library artifacts occur when preparing ribosome-profiling libraries under conditions that are realistic for mammalian cells, where input material is limiting. Our strategy allows to correct for this and to further reduce the required input material taking ribosome profiling one step closer to analysis on the single-cell level.</p><p>Another critical step for codon-specific sequence analysis appears to be the use of the previously established circularization protocol <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Dual-ligation protocols using fixed linker proved to severely perturb gene-translation analysis at the level of global gene expression, codon-specific translation and coverage of individual ORFs. We therefore, do not recommend its use for the generation of ribosome-profiling datasets despite the relative ease of library preparation.</p><p>In summary, the implementation of our adapted protocol will help to facilitate ribosome profiling as a technique to address open questions not only in the field of RNA modifications.</p></sec><sec id="s0105"><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p>The authors have no conflicts to declare.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b0005"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="h0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Grosjean</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name></person-group><chapter-title>Nucleic acids are not boring long polymers of only four types of nucleotides: a guided tour</chapter-title><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Grosjean</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name></person-group><source>DNA and RNA Modification Enzymes: Structure, Mechanism, Function and Evolution</source><year>2009</year><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>18</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="b0010"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="h0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Agris</surname><given-names>P.F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Vendeix</surname><given-names>F.A.P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Graham</surname><given-names>W.D.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>TRNA&#x02019;s wobble decoding of the genome: 40 years of modification</article-title><source>J.

(A) RPF coverage of representative yeast ORFs made with a commercial dual ligation kit or according to a circularization based approach. Coverage of circularization-based libraries is given in orange, dual ligation libraries in light blue (colors match in A, B, C and E). The annotated ORF is indicated in dark blue. (B) Boxplot showing standard deviations of codon coverage of individual transcripts in three replicates of the ribosome-profiling libraries shown in A. Sequencing density was corrected for library size and the first 15 codons in each gene were omitted from analysis. Higher values and wider boxplots point to uneven coverage of transcripts. (C) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) comparing transcript read counts from both library types using three replicates each. Top right: Regression analysis of transcript read counts from both libraries, regression line in red. Spearman correlation: 0.8771. (D) Differential expression of two-linker ligation libraries relative to circularization libraries (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3) using DESeq2 with a log2 fold change threshold of 0.8 and an adjusted p-value of 0.05. Differentially expressed genes are indicated in red. (E) Codon-specific A-site ribosome occupancy relative to downstream sites (mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;SD, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3).

(A) Schematic overview of ribosome-profiling library preparation from footprint sequences (blue), using fixed or randomized linkers in combination with a standard or randomized RT primer. Illumina sequencing of the resulting libraries includes randomized sequences allowing for downstream analysis and artifact removal. (B) Example of a dual randomized sequencing read showing three randomized positions (3&#x000a0;N) derived from the RT-primer (green), the footprint (blue) and the four randomized positions (4&#x000a0;N) of the linker (purple).

(A) Compositions of mRNA and RPF libraries prepared with fixed linkers or two different randomization strategies. Unique reads (blue) are sequences only present once in the library regardless of randomized sequences. Amplification duplicates (red) are reads that cannot be identified as unique based on randomization. The remaining sequences appear multiple times, but can be distinguished by randomization of the DNA linker (green), the RT primer (yellow) or a unique combination of both (orange). (B) Composition of two replicates of RPF libraries (as in A) with fixed linkers or dual randomization using a high input (samples as in A) or a 2&#x02013;6&#x000d7; lower input of the same monosomal RNA for ribosome profiling.
