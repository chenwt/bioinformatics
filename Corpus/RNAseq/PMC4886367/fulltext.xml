GC B cells that have successfully been selected and expanded in the GC can then give rise to long-lived plasma cells or memory B cells (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Nutt et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, humoral immunity is generated in a multilayered process that includes the generation of short-lived, low-affinity plasma blasts, as well as affinity-matured, long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells. During this differentiation process, B cells undergo a dramatic remodeling of their transcriptional profile (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2015</xref>), which is tightly controlled by a network of regulators that ensure effective humoral immunity (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Nutt et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>When B cells adopt a GC fate, they induce expression of Bcl6, which is essential for the efficient proliferation and survival of GC B cells during CSR and somatic hypermutation that underpins antigen-receptor affinity maturation (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Fukuda et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Basso and Dalla-Favera, 2012</xref>). Plasma cell differentiation on the other hand is driven by the transcriptional regulator Blimp1, which is essential for the generation of antibody-secreting plasma cells (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Shapiro-Shelef et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Kallies et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), and Xbp1, required for efficient antibody-secretion (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Reimold et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Shaffer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Taubenheim et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, in addition to these master regulators of fate determination in the B cell lineage, other transcriptional regulators operate that are critical for the initiation, timing and efficiency of these differentiation processes. For example, Bach2 is required for the generation of GC B cells as a result of its role in repressing Blimp1 expression and preventing premature commitment to plasma cell differentiation (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Muto et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Similarly, a transcriptional module consisting of IRF8 and PU.1 acts to limit plasma cell differentiation (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Carotta et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Although plasma cell development is dependent on Blimp1, we have shown previously that plasma cell differentiation is initiated independently of this transcriptional regulator. Loss of activity of Pax5, a transcription factor required for B cell lineage commitment (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Nutt et al., 1999</xref>), defines a preplasmablast stage that precedes plasma cell differentiation (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Kallies et al., 2007</xref>). A major regulator of the early steps of plasma cell differentiation is the transcription factor IRF4, which is required for both Blimp1 expression and the differentiation of plasma cells (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Sciammas et al., 2006</xref>). However, the role of IRF4 in antigen-induced B cell differentiation is much broader, as it is also required for the early stages of the GC response and CSR (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Ochiai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Willis et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, recent data suggest that IRF4 is involved in regulating fundamental processes of cellular metabolism and survival (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Man et al., 2013</xref>), thus its role in B cell differentiation may be of a more pleiotropic nature. In line with this notion, IRF4 is up-regulated early during B cell activation, preceding commitment to both the GC and plasma cell fates (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Ochiai et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Inhibitors of DNA-binding/differentiation (Id) proteins, in particular Id2 and Id3, have been implicated in the differentiation of several immune cell subsets including B cells (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kee et al., 2001</xref>). Id proteins heterodimerize with basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors such as E-proteins and prevent their binding to DNA (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kee, 2009</xref>). E-proteins function by forming dimers that can bind to E-boxes within promoter/enhancer regions of target genes to facilitate transcription. Because Id proteins lack a DNA-binding domain, an Id/E-protein heterodimer cannot bind DNA. Thus, Id proteins negatively regulate E-protein activity (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Murre, 2005</xref>). Id proteins, particularly Id2, have been implicated in humoral immunity. For example, Id2 was shown to negatively regulate CSR to IgE, and enforced expression of Id2 resulted in down-regulation of activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID) expression and a block in CSR (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gonda et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Sugai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kishida et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, Id2 was proposed to act not only via inhibition of E-protein family members, but also by blocking the activity of Pax5 (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gonda et al., 2003</xref>). Id3 is expressed in B cells and is involved in CSR and proliferation in response to B cell receptor cross-linking (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Shaffer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Hayakawa et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In B cells, E2A (with two isoforms, E12 and E47) is the dominant E-protein and of singular importance as it is required for B cell commitment and early B cell development (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bain et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Zhuang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2010</xref>). Although expressed throughout the B cell lineage, E2A is dispensable for mature B cell survival and for plasma cell differentiation. It does, however, play a critical role in AID expression and is important for maintaining GC (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Sayegh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kwon et al., 2008</xref>). E2-2, another E-protein expressed in B cells, appears to play only minor roles in B cell development and differentiation (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Wikstr&#x000f6;m et al., 2006</xref>). However, despite the critical roles that E and Id proteins play during early B cell lineage commitment and their continuous expression throughout the B cell lineage, their function in mature B cells is only partially understood.</p><p>In this study, we uncover an essential role for the Id3&#x02013;E-protein axis in the transcriptional regulation of humoral immunity. We show that down-regulation of Id3 expression in B cells is essential for releasing E2A and E2-2 activity, which is necessary for both GC B cell and plasma cell differentiation. We demonstrate that this pathway controls the expression of multiple key factors required for antigen-induced B cell differentiation, including Blimp1, Xbp1, Obf1, Mef2b, and CXCR4, and is therefore critical for establishing the transcriptional network that controls GC B cell and plasma cell differentiation. This work reveals a novel and unexpected layer of complexity in the transcriptional network that governs peripheral B cell differentiation in response to antigen.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="s01"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s02"><title>Id3 is a negative regulator of plasma cell differentiation</title><p>To examine the expression of Id proteins in B lineage cells, we made use of Id2 and Id3 reporter mice. <italic>Id3</italic><sup><italic>GFP</italic></sup> mice carry a GFP expression cassette that was inserted into exon 1 of the <italic>Id3</italic> locus.

However, despite its high expression in resting and activated B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 a</xref>), E2A was found to be dispensable for mature B cell maintenance and plasma cell differentiation (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kwon et al., 2008</xref>). Mice lacking E2A in B cells, however, showed reduced GC B cell development in comparison to controls (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kwon et al., 2008</xref>). RNAseq analysis of sorted follicular B cells, GC B cells, and plasma cells (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2015</xref>) confirmed high expression of <italic>Tcf3</italic> (E2A) in B lineage cells.

Of note and as outlined above, as plasma cells fail to develop in the combined absence of E2A and E2-2, RNAseq was performed on activated B cells that had not differentiated into plasma cells in either genotype. Thus, our data relate to the initiation phase of plasma cell differentiation. In total 64 of the plasma cell signature genes (21.3%) were not induced appropriately in the combined absence of E2A and E2-2, suggesting that the induction of the plasma cell differentiation program depends on E-protein activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 b</xref>).

Despite significant progress, however, many questions remain, particularly concerning the partitioning of GC and plasma cell fate. Here, we identify a new transcriptional circuit critical for both GC B cell and plasma cell differentiation. We show that the activity of the E-protein transcription factors E2A and E2-2 is essential for humoral immune responses and is tightly controlled by the expression of Id3. This sheds new light on the initiating events of GC and plasma cell development and allows for a better understanding of how differentiation in response to antigen is orchestrated in the B cell lineage.</p><p>During an infection it is critical to promote rapid plasma cell differentiation to generate large amounts of antibody that may prevent or slow down the spreading of the pathogen. Concurrently, some antigen-specific B cells need to be retained to allow clonal population expansion, CSR, and affinity maturation in the GC. This is not only essential for the generation of long-lived plasma cells, producing high-affinity antibody but also for retention of antigen-specificity in the form of memory B cells (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Tarlinton and Good-Jacobson, 2013</xref>). Although multiple molecular regulators of antigen-induced B cell differentiation have been identified, there is uncertainty as to how terminal differentiation into plasma cells and retention of antigen-specific B cells as self-renewing GC and memory B cells is partitioned and timed. Our results demonstrate that the Id3-E2A&#x02013;E2-2 axis is a critical component of the transcriptional network that governs this process. Although deletion of either E2A or E2-2 alone did not have a major impact on GC or plasma cell differentiation, the combined absence of these E-proteins resulted in a complete block in antigen-induced B cell differentiation. Our data demonstrate that E-proteins play a major role in initiating and orchestrating the transcriptional networks associated with GC and plasma cell differentiation. Expression of genes critical for plasma cell differentiation including <italic>Prdm1</italic> (encoding Blimp1) and <italic>Xbp1</italic> failed to be induced in the absence of E-protein activity. In addition to these essential factors, numerous other components of the plasma cell transcriptional signature were not induced appropriately, suggesting that E-proteins target multiple pathways that underpin plasma cell differentiation. This may be similar during GC development, as we found multiple critical targets of E-proteins that are either involved in the transcriptional regulation of GC B cell development or the local organization of productive GC structures. This included <italic>Mef2b</italic>, an upstream regulator of <italic>Bcl6</italic>, and <italic>Cxcr4</italic>, a chemokine receptor involved in GC dark and light zone organization (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Victora and Nussenzweig, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Ying et al., 2013</xref>). Consequently, multiple components of the transcriptional signature associated with GC B cells were deregulated in the absence of E2A and E2-2. Thus, E-proteins are major regulators of both GC B cell and plasma cell differentiation.</p><p>Importantly, we found that Id3, but not Id2, is a critical regulator of the E2A/E2-2 transcriptional module. Id3 is highly expressed in mature B cells and therefore limits activity of E-proteins in resting B cells. After B cell activation, Id3 is down-regulated, thereby releasing E-protein activity and allowing for GC B cell and plasma cell differentiation. Although our results demonstrate that E2A and E2-2 are required for GC B cell development, it remains unclear how E-protein activity is regulated in the GC, where tight control of E-protein activity appears to be important. This is supported by the observation that Id3 expression is maintained in GC B cells, albeit at lower levels compared with naive B cells, suggesting that a titration of E-protein activity is critical for the segregation of GC B cell and plasma cell differentiation. Indeed, deletion of E2A alone in B cells results in a reduction in GC B cells as reported previously (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kwon et al., 2008</xref>). The notion that E-protein activity and Id protein expression in B cells need to be tightly controlled is also supported by several studies that report high frequencies of mutations in Id3 or aberrant expression of Id2 in Hodgkin's and Burkitt's lymphoma (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Renn&#x000e9; et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Love et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Richter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Schmitz et al., 2014</xref>). Although some of these mutations impact on cell proliferation and survival, our data suggest that certain mutations may also block antigen-induced B cell differentiation and could thus contribute to lymphoma development.</p><p>Several transcriptional circuits have been identified as being required to coordinate B cell differentiation in response to antigen. Most prominently, this includes the IRF4-Bcl6-Blimp1 transcriptional network that is central to GC B cell and plasma cell differentiation. Interestingly, the way in which the Id3-E2A&#x02013;E2-2 axis controls antigen-induced differentiation in the B cell lineage appears to be distinct from other transcriptional circuits guiding B cell differentiation. Whereas transcription factors such as Blimp1, Bcl6, or IRF4, are induced only after B cell activation, E2A and E2-2 are abundantly expressed throughout both development and maintenance of mature B cells and do not need to be produced de novo. They are kept in check by Id3, which too is highly expressed in naive B cells and appears to neutralize the activity of both E-proteins. As activated B cells down-regulate Id3 expression in a cell division dependent manner, E-protein activity is released, thereby allowing for the initiation of plasma cell differentiation. The evolution of such a brake and release mechanism may be important to ensure a rapid and quantitatively appropriate response to antigenic challenges. Such a mechanism may also play a role in restraining premature plasma cell differentiation. This is supported by the observation that B cell survival in the periphery requires tonic antigen-receptor signaling (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), which however, does not lead to substantial GC or plasma cell differentiation. Thus, Id3 may be one of the factors that renders B cells relatively inert to weak stimuli and thereby prevents unnecessary differentiation with concomitant depletion of the mature B cell pool.</p><p>Importantly, Id3 expression is compatible with recruitment of B cells into the GC, thereby allowing extensive proliferation and affinity maturation. This is important, as plasma cell differentiation is a proliferation-dependent process, with cells undergoing more divisions being more likely to differentiate into plasma cells (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Hasbold et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Nutt et al., 2015</xref>). Although it has been proposed that B cell fate is allocated in a stochastic fashion during this process (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Duffy et al., 2012</xref>), it is clear that transcriptional regulators play critical roles in determining the likelihood of differentiation versus self-renewal. Id3 may fulfill such a role, by limiting the probability of undergoing differentiation. Thus, Id3-controlled progression into plasma cell differentiation could be envisaged after two not necessarily exclusive models. Proliferation-dependent down-regulation of Id3 may serve to delay plasma cell differentiation, thereby creating a window of opportunity during which CSR and affinity maturation can occur before differentiation. Interestingly, such a switch in GC output has been proposed before (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Shlomchik and Weisel, 2012</xref>). Alternatively, B cell receptor signaling strength may directly determine the extent of Id3 down-regulation in the GC, meaning affinity maturation itself could define the timing of plasma cell differentiation, a long held model of GC B cell differentiation (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Tarlinton and Smith, 2000</xref>). However, data showing diminished BCR signaling in GC B cells argue against this latter possibility (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Khalil et al., 2012</xref>). The work reported here further unravels the tightly controlled molecular network that governs B cell differentiation in response to antigen and may allow better understanding of the relative contribution of stochastic and deterministic modes to this process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s11"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec id="s12"><title/><sec id="s13"><title>Mice</title><p><italic>Id2</italic><sup><italic>GFP</italic></sup>and <italic>Blimp1</italic><sup><italic>GFP</italic></sup> mice were described previously (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Kallies et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et al., 2011</xref>)<italic>.
