Reviewing recent literature on the cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP)-derived targets of Fmrp in the brain, and the literature on identifying genes thought to mediate autism and other psychiatric disorders, reveals that both appear to be disproportionately made up of highly brain-expressed genes. This suggests a parsimonious explanation&#x02014;that the overlap between Fmrp targets and neuropsychiatric candidate genes might be secondary to simple features such as transcript length and robust expression in the brain. Indeed, reanalyzing Fmrp high-throughput sequencing of RNAs isolated by CLIP (HITS-CLIP) data suggests that approximately 60% of CLIP tag depth can be predicted by gene expression, coding sequence length, and transcript length. Furthermore, there is a statistically significant overlap between autism candidate genes and random samples of long, highly brain-expressed genes, whether they are Fmrp targets or not.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Comparison of known Fmrp-binding targets to candidate gene lists should be informed by both of these features.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13229-015-0008-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>FMRP interactome</kwd><kwd>Autism</kwd><kwd>Genome-wide association</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Findings</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Introduction</title><p>In 2011, Darnell <italic>et al</italic>. published a study on the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (Fmrp) that demonstrated through brute-force biochemistry and elegant informatics, a fundamental role for Fmrp in stalling of ribosomes in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Included was a table of the RNAs identified as bound to Fmrp. While the authors were careful to note their analysis likely &#x0201c;&#x02026;underestimates the true number of Fmrp-regulated mRNAs,&#x0201d; this table has gradually become taken as the <italic>de facto</italic> Fmrp regulon - the comprehensive set of transcripts regulated by Fmrp. Since then, it has become recurrent in the psychiatric genetics literature to examine the intersection between the risk genes of a disorder and these Fmrp targets, often demonstrating a significant overlap between the two (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]). However, while statistically significant, these results are difficult to interpret. Does this mean the Fmrp protein is central to all of these diseases and processes? Or is Fmrp binding serving as a proxy for some other features of the genes that may parsimoniously explain their contribution to genetic risk? Here, we test a simple alternative explanation for these Fmrp-related findings: both these Fmrp targets and genes that moderate neurocognitive traits contain a disproportionate number of long and highly brain-expressed genes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>There are two key facets of the reported Fmrp targets that motivated this analysis. First, as highlighted in the 2011 work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], the Fmrp protein binds mRNA rather promiscuously, not being strongly restricted to RNAs with one particular motif in the CNS. Second, Fmrp itself is highly expressed throughout the nervous system, particularly, though not uniquely, in neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Thus, as the confidence of Fmrp binding was dependent on read-depth, and the protein is both fairly promiscuous in sequence specificity and ubiquitously expressed in the brain, the most readily detected transcripts might be those that present the most opportunity for binding - those with the longest coding sequence and the highest expression. Thus, we tested the hypotheses that the reported Fmrp targets disproportionately represent the most abundant mRNAs in the brain (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A) and those with the longest coding sequence (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). In support of this, using a list of genes with the highest expression in the human brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], one can demonstrate that the reported Fmrp targets disproportionately overlap with the most highly expressed neural genes in humans (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;3e<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The Fmrp targets are highly expressed in the brain, and highly brain-expressed genes overlap with autism candidate genes.

It has been recognized that, since body weight tracks with consumptive behaviors, obesity is strongly influenced by genes that are expressed in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Thus, we tested the statistical overlap between reported genes for &#x0201c;obesity-related traits&#x0201d; and the reported Fmrp targets and see a statistical enrichment of a magnitude not too different from that sometimes seen in the literature for psychiatric disorder (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.005,). Thus, the results of our experiment are consistent with the explanation that genes mediating any neurogenetic trait may show overlap with the reported Fmrp targets simply because both sets overlap with the set of genes highly expressed in neural tissue. Indeed, genes reported for several other neurocognitive traits also overlap Fmrp targets with nominal (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) significance, for example, &#x0201c;hippocampal atrophy&#x0201d; (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.009), &#x0201c;Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease&#x0201d; (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.022), and &#x0201c;cognitive performance&#x0201d; (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.012).</p><p>Darnell et al. suspected a bias towards highly expressed or longer transcripts in their analysis and reported a very modest correlation between transcript abundance (cor&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.1) and number of cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP)-seq tags ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). However, their measures of abundance were based on microarray signal, which can be strongly biased by features unrelated to RNA abundance (for example, probe GC content), and lack the dynamic range of RNAseq analysis. Analyzing instead with RNAseq data from postnatal day 21, mouse cortex shows a correlation of 0.64 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B) with expression and 0.45 with coding sequence (Cds) length (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). Indeed, we found that a linear regression model incorporating expression, Cds length, and transcript length could account for &#x0003e;60% of the variance (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>) in CLIP tag number (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). We would emphasize that the presence of detectable, albeit weak, motifs in the targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] indicates they are non-random and thus the initial findings were not exclusively driven by these features. The more likely explanation was that the sensitivity was limited to the highly expressed Fmrp targets and that many less abundant (but perhaps equally high affinity) Fmrp targets might simply have been below the threshold of detection. In the future, the comprehensive identification of Fmrp targets in the brain could be revisited with approaches to allow greater sensitivity and perhaps cell-specific normalization for transcript abundance. However, in the meantime, we tested two candidate gene lists, the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) database of curated autism candidates (SFARIdb) and the recently identified rare <italic>de novo</italic> variants in autism probands (rDNV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], to see if a statistically significant overlap with Fmrp targets could be reproduced just using equally sized sets of random genes sampled to match as best possible the transcript abundance (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1) or coding sequence length (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2) of the Fmrp target genes.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

To make sure our results were not particular to a single sampling, we sampled 1,000 such gene lists. Most overlapped significantly with the autism candidates (Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D), though again not as significantly as the reported Fmrp targets. Very similar results can be seen by comparing a contingency table overlapping the Fmrp targets and the rDNV genes relative to all brain-expressed genes (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;6.02e&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;12) or instead calculating the contingency table for just the genes with expression in the top quantile (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0002): gene expression level alone accounts for some of the overlap between rDNV genes and Fmrp targets, but not all of it.</p><p>However, when instead sampling random gene sets to match the Fmrp targets simultaneously on Cds length and expression level (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), we found that a substantial fraction of the sampled lists showed an equivalent or greater statistical overlap than the original target Fmrp list (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C). Finally, we repeated these analyses but excluded the Fmrp genes from the sampling pool. Because the Fmrp genes so strongly monopolize the long and highly expressed gene space (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A), it was impossible to sample a set of genes that perfectly matched the two-dimensional distribution of the Fmrp targets after excluding those genes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3A, B). Nonetheless, a random set of non-Fmrp target genes, or simply a list of the longest and highest expressed non-Fmrp target genes, also significantly overlapped both of the autism candidate lists (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3C). This demonstrates that long, highly expressed genes in the brain tend to overlap with disease-risk genes, whether they are on the Fmrp target list or not. It is worth noting that a disproportionate amount of long and highly brain-expressed genes is not just a feature of the Fmrp targets, but of course many other sets of genes important for the functioning of the nervous system (for example, Gene Ontologies terms for &#x02018;Synapse&#x02019; or proteomics studies of synaptic proteins), so some of the conclusions here extend beyond consideration of just the Fmrp targets. Likewise, genes with enriched expression in the brain are on average longer than genes expressed in other tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and thus any analysis that identifies long genes may tend to overlap statistically with brain-expressed genes, Fmrp targets, autism candidates, synaptic proteins, etc.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>

This is consistent with long and highly brain-expressed genes also being more likely to be under selective constraint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] or containing critical exons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and provides a straightforward explanation for why the Fmrp target list overlaps so frequently with sets of genes implicated in psychiatric disease by genetic studies. It is imaginable that similar features may explain why the Fmrp target list also frequently overlaps results of brain transcriptomic studies as well. This parsimonious explanation thus obviates complex hypotheses which require the Fmrp protein itself to be involved in the mechanism for many diverse disorders or different forms of ASD. Of course, mutations in Fmrp clearly do still cause Fragile X Syndrome, the most common form of monogenic ASD, and thus continued research into this protein remains important for that reason alone.</p><p>This model also provides reasonable explanations for two other puzzles about the Fmrp targets. First, it could explain why studies of the Fmrp targets in HEK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] are less concordant with other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and why HEK cell data overlaps marginally if at all with psychiatric disorder candidate gene lists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The HEK cell data should be biased towards long, highly expressed genes in HEK cells, which will likely contain few neural-specific transcripts. Second, this model might explain why identifying strong <italic>cis</italic> motifs or other features in the RNA that might mediate Fmrp binding has proven challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Efforts to model the affinity of Fmrp for particular mRNAs will likely be aided by first removing the variance in the Fmrp CLIP data that can be explained by transcript length, Cds length, and transcript abundance. The authors of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] suspected a bias towards highly expressed genes, but recognized the data were not available at that time to adjust for it, particularly if the level of Fmrp varies substantially across cell types in the brain. Thus, the definition of the Fmrp targets can probably now be revisited both with greater sensitivity and by models incorporating these covarying factors to identify additional features of the transcripts that account for the remaining variance in Fmrp binding.</p><p>In the end, it may well be that these studies find that Fmrp does bind preferentially to those transcripts whose protein levels most require precise regulation for normal CNS function. It is not unreasonable that this set of genes would also be vulnerable to haploinsufficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and of course be expressed highly in the brain. And a set of genes needing more precise regulation may indeed be selected by evolution to be longer (that is, allowing more potential sites for regulatory motifs). Thus, Fmrp binding may have been serving as a useful proxy for these other features. However, in the interim, we have provided a table (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S1) with precalculated weightings for length, expression, or length and expression for measurably brain-expressed genes. This can be used for drawing random samples for comparison to candidate gene lists, to help determine whether the candidate list is enriched in Fmrp targets specifically and/or long, highly brain-expressed transcripts generally.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Comparisons to GWAS and GTEX</title><p>Eight hundred forty-two Fmrp targets were identified from Supplemental Table 2 of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].

For each replicate, cortical dissections were performed on three C57BL/6 male mice 21&#x000a0;days post birth.

Sequencing libraries were amplified (21&#x000a0;cycles) using Nugen Amplification Kit Ovation&#x000ae; RNA-Seq System V2 (7102). Standard Illumina adapter ligation, library preparation, and sequencing were performed on an Illumina Hi-seq by the Genome Technology Access Center at Washington University in St. Louis. Resulting reads were trimmed for quality and contaminating adapters. Possible rRNA contamination was filtered out by aligning with Bowtie2 to rRNA sequences from GenBank, ENSEMBL, and UCSC&#x02019;s RepeatMasker track. Remaining sequences were then mapped to the Ensembl 75 mouse genome. Counts per million reads (CPM) for each gene were quantified using HTSeq. Data represent the average of three biological replicates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Comparisons to length and expression</title><p>We then intersected this data with Supplemental Table 2C of Darnell et al. for all genes with a matching gene symbol and extracted Fmrp high-throughput sequencing of RNAs isolated by cross-linking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) tag count (Fmrp.sum), Cds length, and transcript length. For sampling analyses, we used all genes with measurable expression in the brain (logCPM&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;2 in RNAseq data), as only brain-expressed genes could have been captured by a brain HITS-CLIP experiment and further filtered to keep only those genes with an annotated Cds and transcript lengths (final effective genome size&#x02009;=&#x02009;9,544). All variables were converted to Log2 scale for normality prior to correlation and linear regression, and for these analyses genes with &#x0003c;1 CLIP tag were excluded (final gene number, 7207).

A similar sampling was done based using a kernel estimated from the Cds length or a 2d kernel (function kde2d) on both length and expression. Fisher&#x02019;s tests were calculated as above for overlap between sampled lists with a genome size of 9,544. For !Fmrp lists, sampling was conducted on the 8,828 non-Fmrp genes, but with the same probabilities as above, or taking those of the 8,828 with the highest probabilities (Top !Fmrp). All sampling is without replacement.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec11"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13229_2015_8_MOESM1_ESM.jpeg" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Figure S1.</label><caption><p>Sampled distributions for expression approximately match the distribution of Fmrp genes.
