<italic>Volvox carteri (V. carteri)</italic> is a multicellular green alga used as model system for the evolution of multicellularity.

V. carteri</italic> is a freshwater alga with female and male cells that can reproduce both sexually and asexually and is composed of two different cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Asexual forms are characterized by a spheroid that is composed of approx. 2000 somatic cells and encloses several reproductive cells. Each of these so called gonidia can undergo symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions to form a new colony of somatic cells and gonidia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The sexual life cycle is started by a sex-inducing pheromone that can be secreted by male strains and is functional at very low concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Pheromone signaling induces the sexual differentiation program and therefore the generation of egg cells in female strains, while male strains form sperm packages that are subsequently released into the water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Dimorphic sexes have evolved several times in plants, however their origins are unclear. The fact, that the sexually dimorphic and multicellular species <italic>V. carteri</italic> and the unicellular species <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> had a common ancestor about 200 million years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] makes <italic>Volvox</italic> an ideal system for studying the evolution of these processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Non-coding RNAs, including small RNAs, have been associated with processes that are crucial to eukaryotic evolution. Small RNAs are processed from longer precursor molecules to their mature forms that are subsequently bound by a member of the Argonaute (AGO) protein family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Argonaute proteins are characterized by distinct domains that anchor both the 5&#x02032; and the 3&#x02032; end of the small RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Some but not all Argonaute proteins are endonucleases and can cleave target RNAs that are complementary to the bound small RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In many organisms, several Argonaute protein genes exist and especially in plants each AGO protein prefers and selects different small RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In land plants, several different pathways that make use of specialized small RNAs are known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For example, short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are processed from transgene- or virus-derived double stranded (ds) RNAs and guide sequence-specific cleavage of complementary (foreign) RNAs. Furthermore, small RNAs can direct DNA methylation and subsequent gene silencing processes in a pathway known as RNA-dependent DNA methylation (RdDM). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are processed from endogenous miRNA genes and guide repression of complementary target mRNA expression as a means of gene regulation. Unlike in animals, where miRNAs bind to partially complementary sequences, plant miRNAs mainly repress their target mRNAs by hybridizing to fully complementary sites followed by sequence-specific cleavage. So-called trans acting siRNAs (tasiRNAs) are plant-specific and also regulate gene expression. This pathway is initiated by a miRNA (most prominently miR-390), which guides cleavage of a target. The cleaved transcript is used as template by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) to generate a long dsRNA, which is cleaved by DCL4 to produce many tasiRNAs thus amplifying the signal. These RNAs, in turn, silence the respective locus by transcript cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Recently, it has been shown in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> that a miRNA can also guide cleavage of transposon transcripts and, similarly, the cleaved transcript serves as template for dsRNA, which gives subsequently rise to siRNAs that repress transposon expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. SiRNAs and miRNAs have been identified in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, indicating that small RNA pathways have evolved at early stages of plant evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Given the importance of different small RNAs in processes closely associated with multicellular development in land plants, we speculated that they might have played a role in the transition from uni- to multicellularity in green algae. MiRNA candidates have been reported in <italic>V. carteri</italic>, but their function remains unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Here, we have performed small RNA-Seq as well as RNA-Seq of mRNAs from different stages of <italic>V. carteri</italic> providing a global and comprehensive atlas of gene expression in somatic and reproductive cells. To identify functional small RNAs, we isolated VcAGO3 protein and cloned and deep sequenced associated small RNAs. Using this functional approach, we clearly define miRNAs as well as their specific expression under different conditions. Of note, the identified miRNAs are not conserved in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>. Furthermore, we find miRNAs as well as siRNAs originating from transposons such as <italic>Jordan</italic> or <italic>Kangaroo</italic>, for example. Strikingly, miRNAs are not only expressed from transposons but also seem to target such elements, suggesting miRNA-guided repression of transposable elements. Finally, we also provide evidence for loci that generate phased siRNAs similar to tasiRNAs found in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Although green algae and higher land plants including <italic>A. thaliana</italic> diverged very early and evolution proceeded independently, we provide evidence that many small RNA pathways found in land plants have also evolved in <italic>V. carteri</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Transcriptome sequencing and annotation</title><p>We sought to characterize expression activity and dynamics not only of small RNAs, but also of mRNAs in <italic>V. carteri</italic>, since these are often modulated by small RNAs. When we started this study, only very little transcriptomic data had been available for <italic>V. carteri</italic> in general. We therefore cloned and sequenced RNAs under various experimental conditions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). We included somatic cells and gonidia under vegetative growth conditions, somatic cells as well as gonidia after induction of sexual reproduction, along with somatic and egg cells from a female culture (fully differentiated). Using all single-end as well as paired-end sequencing data, a transcriptome assembly was generated in order to analyze mRNA transcripts in more detail. This comprehensive data set enabled us to analyze transcripts and their possible connection to small RNAs in better detail. All RNAseq data are available at the NCBI SRA under PRJNA266874 for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>AGO-associated small RNAs of <italic>V. carteri</italic></title><p>To identify functional small RNA pathways in <italic>V. carteri</italic>, we first examined available transcriptome data and our own RNA-Seq data for the presence of potential factors that are known to be involved in RNA silencing pathways and that are also known to be conserved proteins. We found a PAZ/PIWI domain-containing gene, typical for Argonaute genes, which we refer to as VcAGO3, since a similar transcript had already been annotated at this locus (XM_002952848) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Furthermore, we found genes for an additional AGO protein (although we could not amplify the complete transcript from cDNA for this gene so far), one Dicer, one RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRP) and a HEN1 homolog (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1), suggesting that several small RNA pathways might operate in <italic>V. carteri</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Characterization of small RNAs associated with VcAGO3. <bold>a</bold> Domain structure of <italic>V. carteri</italic> VcAGO3.

</p><p>To identify functional small RNAs, we expressed myc-tagged VcAGO3 in <italic>V. carteri</italic> by gold particle-mediated plasmid delivery, isolated associated small RNAs by anti-myc immunoprecipitation and cloned and sequenced them (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The length of the VcAGO3-associated RNAs peaks at 21 and 22&#x000a0;nt (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). While the GC content of the genome of <italic>V. carteri</italic> is about 60&#x000a0;%, the 5&#x02032; terminal nucleotide of the bound small RNAs is mainly uridine, suggesting that the VcAGO3 MID domain accommodates preferentially 5&#x02032; terminal uridines, similar to human Ago2 and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Ago1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). VcAGO3-associated small RNAs that map to the genome can be grouped into different functional categories including repetitive elements (RE), protein coding regions (sense and antisense), phased siRNAs or miRNAs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref> and <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">f</xref>). Since the transcriptome and RNA classes in general are only poorly annotated in <italic>V. carteri</italic>, the identity of the largest part of our library cannot be deduced yet. However, these sequences are bound by VcAGO3 and therefore are presumably functional (see also below and Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p><p>To predict miRNAs in <italic>Volvox</italic>, we utilized the novel miRNA identification tool miRA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] using criteria adopted from the prediction of miRNAs in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In total, 490 miRNAs were predicted when running miRA on the VcAGO3 data set as well as six libraries from different cells and life stages from <italic>V. carteri</italic> (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2 and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S2). These predicted miRNAs fall into 324 miRNA families (miRNAs with the same sequence, but different genomic location), the largest one comprising 48 members and 67 families had two or more members. The nucleotide preference for VcAGO3-bound miRNAs is even more pronounced towards a U at the 5&#x02032; end (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>), indicating high specificity of our miRNA identification approach. In conclusion, we identified VcAGO3-associated potential miRNAs in different cell types and under different cellular conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Experimental validation of <italic>V. carteri</italic> miRNAs</title><p>A general feature of small RNAs or miRNAs in particular in plants is a 2&#x02032;O-methylation at the 3&#x02032; end [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. To test whether our miRNA candidates contain such characteristic modifications, we performed &#x003b2;-elimination experiments with total RNA from somatic cells and reproductive cells (gonidia). In this chemical reaction, an unmethylated 3&#x02032; end will lose its terminal base and as a consequence, migrate faster in polyacrylamide gels. As a positive control, an unrelated RNA oligonucleotide with unprotected 3&#x02032; end was spiked in prior to the reaction. While the positive control clearly shifted after treatment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), all analyzed small RNAs from <italic>V. carteri</italic> migrated at the same length as before indicating that they are indeed modified at their 3&#x02019; ends (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). These findings are consistent with the presence of a HEN1 homolog in the <italic>V. carteri</italic> genome (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1) and suggest that our candidate RNAs are most likely miRNA.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Validation of VcAGO3 and small RNA properties. <bold>a</bold> &#x003b2;-elimination experiment performed with total RNA from gonidia (reproductive cells) as well as from somatic cells showing that small RNAs in <italic>V. carteri</italic> are modified and do not shift upon periodate treatment.

For VcAGO3, three different small RNAs were selected according to read abundance in the VcAGO3 library, for AtAGO1, two known and abundant miRNAs were chosen. Immunoprecipitated Ago proteins (loaded with their endogenously bound small RNAs) were incubated with 5&#x02032; radiolabeled target RNA carrying a perfectly complementary site to the respective small RNA. After incubation, RNA was extracted and run on a gel. To indicate the position of the cleavage product, each target RNA was digested with RNase T1 (cleaves after G&#x02019;s) to serve as a ladder.

</p><p>After identifying miRNA sequences in <italic>V. carteri</italic> and establishing that they are modified at their 3&#x02032; end, we investigated miRNA expression under varying physiological conditions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). We harvested samples at different life stages of <italic>V. carteri</italic> (asexual growth (V), 16&#x000a0;h induction of the sexual program (I) and female sexual differentiation (F)) and the culture from each stage was split into the two different cell types of <italic>V. carteri</italic> (somatic cells and reproductive cells). RNA blots performed with these samples show that miRNAs are indeed regulated between cell types and some are even regulated during development (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) indicating that <italic>V. carteri</italic> miRNAs might play an important role not only for cellular maintenance but also during differentiation processes. Of note, the U6 loading control signal is much weaker for the reproductive cells and therefore, only limited comparisons between somatic and reproductive cells can be made.</p><p>In plants, functional small RNAs are incorporated into AGO proteins and guide them to complementary target RNAs for cleavage. The VcAGO3 protein has a putative catalytic triad composed of the amino acids DDD. Although the canonical motif for a cleavage-competent Ago protein is DDH, AtAgo2 contains DDD as well and appears to be a catalytically active enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Cleavage activity of AGO proteins is usually necessary for gene silencing in plants, although mechanisms similar to mammalian AGO proteins have also been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In order to test the cleavage activity of AGO proteins, <italic>in vitro</italic> cleavage assays can be performed in which AGO proteins are purified from cell lysates and incubated with radioactively 5&#x02032; end-labeled, artificial targets that are designed to be fully complementary to an endogenous small RNA bound by the respective AGO protein. After the catalytic reaction, the target RNA is cleaved into two pieces with only the 5&#x02032; end being detectable due to its radiolabeled 5&#x02032; end. In order to test VcAGO3 for catalytic activity, <italic>V. carteri</italic> cultures were transformed with a plasmid carrying either myc-VcAGO3 or myc-CrGFP (control, GFP codon-optimized for <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>). After a short selection period, the cultures were harvested, lysed and an immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed using anti-myc antibodies. Each IP was split into three reactions and cleavage assays were performed using three different small RNA target sequences (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). None of the VcAGO3 reactions generated specific cleavage products (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, lanes 3, 6 and 9), while a Flag-tagged AtAGO1 (used as a positive control) showed clear and strong cleavage activity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, lanes 11 and 13). All proteins were expressed and precipitated successfully as shown by protein blot (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). VcAGO3 appears to be inactive in standard <italic>in vitro</italic> cleavage assays.

Interestingly, miR178al and miR357b originate from a transposon termed <italic>Jordan</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). <italic>Jordan</italic> is a highly abundant transposable element, which resembles the transposable elements <italic>En/Spm</italic> as well as members of the so-called &#x0201c;<italic>CACTA</italic>&#x0201d; family found also in higher plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These elements transpose via a DNA intermediate and contain terminal inverted repeats (TIRs). In the case of <italic>Jordan</italic>, the TIRs cause a secondary structure that is similar to and recognized as a miRNA precursor and each of these elements gives rise to a miRNA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Of note, the precursors of the MIR178 and MIR357 families are highly similar to each other, with one family showing a strong expression of the 5&#x02032; arm miRNA sequence (MIR178 family), while the other expresses the 3&#x02032; arm (MIR357 family) more strongly. Thus, both miRNAs could target each other&#x02019;s precursors with perfect complementarity (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S3). To support the inferences from our small RNA-Seq experiments, we performed RNA blots using probes against the <italic>Jordan</italic>-encoded miRNAs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), which readily validate our sequencing data.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Small RNA mapping to transposable elements. <bold>a</bold> Schematic view of the transposable element <italic>Jordan</italic>.

</p><p>Because transposon-derived miRNAs can trigger a wave of secondary siRNA species in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], we searched for additional VcAGO3-associated small RNAs from <italic>Jordan</italic>. We found many small RNAs originating mainly from the 5&#x02032; 0.5&#x000a0;kb portion (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, upper panel). Whether these transposon-derived siRNAs depend on the <italic>Jordan</italic>-encoded miRNAs is currently unknown. Furthermore, we analyzed <italic>Jordan</italic> for potential miRNA target sites and found that several <italic>V. carteri</italic> miRNAs can target <italic>Jordan</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, black bars). Again, these target sites are largely located in the 5&#x02032; 0.5&#x000a0;kb portion of <italic>Jordan</italic>. Taken together, our data suggest that the transposon <italic>Jordan</italic> not only generates two miRNAs and a number of siRNAs, but might also be targeted by the VcAGO3-associated small RNA system, presumably to repress <italic>Jordan</italic> expression. Of note, VcAGO3 appears to be catalytically inactive <italic>in vitro</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). This might suggest that cleavage-independent silencing mechanisms (e.g. transcriptional silencing by heterochromatin formation) could be active in this process.</p><p>We next analyzed whether other transposons are similar sources of different classes of small RNAs. Close examination of VcAGO3-associated small RNAs did not reveal miRNA genes that are encoded by transposons and pass our annotation criteria. However, transposons such as <italic>Gypsy5-I</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, middle panel) or <italic>Gypsy4-I</italic> (bottom panel) produce a large number of VcAGO3-associated siRNAs. Furthermore, <italic>Gypsy5-I</italic> is in addition targeted by MIR414 and MIR254. Strikingly, a global analysis of our sequencing data revealed that most transposons give rise to small RNAs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S4), suggesting control of expression through small RNA-guided gene silencing pathways.</p><p>At least one miRNA, miR178al, appears to be expressed more strongly in reproductive cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), which might suggest that <italic>Jordan</italic> expression is generally lower in such cells. Indeed, our RNAseq data reveals that less <italic>Jordan</italic>-derived reads were cloned from reproductive cells compared to somatic cells. Generally, we observe, with some exceptions, a tendency of reduced transposon activity in reproductive cells (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Figure S5) suggesting repression of such elements in reproductive cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Other <italic>V. carteri</italic> small RNAs</title><p>In <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, tasiRNAs are produced from RNAs that are specifically cleaved by miRNAs such as miR390. Biogenesis involves dsRNA synthesis by RDR6 and cleavage by DCL4, which progressively cleaves the RNA from the ends and produces phased tasiRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Since we find a putative RdRP in the <italic>V. carteri</italic> genome, we examined our VcAGO3-associated siRNAs for phased siRNA signatures. Indeed, we found several loci that produce phased siRNAs. Most prominently, phased siRNA loci can be found within the transposon <italic>Kangaroo</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Whether these siRNAs require miRNA-guided cleavage as observed for tasiRNAs in <italic>A. thaliana,</italic> is unclear.

To further investigate phased siRNAs, we performed RNA blots (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>).

</p><p>A large portion of the VcAGO3-bound small RNAs did not fit into any known small RNA category, but could be aligned to the genome, indicating that they originated from <italic>V. carteri</italic>, and not from a potential associated microbe. In fact, about 11&#x000a0;% of the putative intergenic reads (7&#x000a0;% of total reads) came from eight specific loci (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">e</xref>), further supporting that such sequences are likely not due to promiscuous binding of VcAGO3 to RNA degradation products. The specificity is further supported by the observation that most of the small RNAs within a peak are identical. It is also unlikely that these reads are unspecifically amplified during library construction since RNA blots supported robust expression and stability (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). For expression analysis, we performed Northern blotting of total RNA obtained from somatic and reproductive cells. Probes directed against the most prominent scaffolds (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>) are readily detectable thus suggesting that these reads are indeed abundant small RNAs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). It is therefore tempting to speculate that these VcAGO3-associated reads might represent a novel class of small RNAs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Comparative genomics of small RNAs in green algae</title><p>Our sequencing data demonstrate that <italic>V. carteri</italic> contains many miRNA candidates.

Since we select for VcAGO3-bound small RNAs only, it is very likely that we identify functional small RNAs and minimize background cloning that would contaminate our libraries. Indeed, our VcAGO3 pull down approach allows for a clear definition of <italic>V. carteri</italic> miRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Of note, our miRNAs are distinct from those reported recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This might be due to different <italic>V. carteri</italic> strains that have been used or, more likely, to mis-annotation of miRNAs as a result of background sequencing from total RNA samples.</p><p>An intriguing observation from our small RNA profiles was that many VcAGO3-bound small RNAs originate from transposons. Different classes including miRNAs, siRNAs and even phased siRNAs have been identified in conjunction with transposons. Since miRNA genes are encoded by the transposon <italic>Jordan</italic>, it is conceivable that this mobile genetic element influences spreading of miRNA genes and might therefore contribute to evolution. Furthermore, transposons are at the same time targeted by miRNAs suggesting that miRNAs might repress the expression of such elements. In addition, transposons appear to produce large numbers of siRNAs especially in reproductive cells. It is therefore likely that transposon targeting by small RNAs might be involved in repressing transposable elements in reproductive cells, a phenomenon that is often observed in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Interestingly, computational analyses have suggested that both <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> have transposable elements that encode simultaneously siRNAs and miRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Whether this suggests a common origin, or convergent evolution of such mechanisms in algae and land plants is unclear.</p><p>Our analyses reveal also interesting evolutionary aspects when analyzing conservation of closely related species. At least the VcAGO3-associated miRNAs are not conserved in the closely related single cellular alga <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, suggesting evolution of different miRNAs presumably required for multicellularity and division of labor between somatic and reproductive cells. This is remarkable given that so many protein-coding genes are well conserved between the two species. It will be interesting to analyze whether other small RNAs, e.g. small RNAs that target transposable elements such as <italic>Jordan</italic>, are conserved. Our findings suggest that targeting such mobile genetic elements by the small RNA pathways developed very early during evolution and the last universal common ancestor of all eukaryotes used such strategies already.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude from our analyses that VcAGO3 not only associates with miRNAs but also many other classes of functional small RNAs.

As required, secondary structure was predicted by means of psipred_3.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and added to the HHblits alignments. The compilation of the database was finalized according to the above-mentioned protocol. Since the open reading frames of annotated <italic>V. carteri</italic> proteins were not always supporting full-length proteins with start and stop codons, different protein sequences were created. DNA was translated in the six putative reading frames to protein sequences by means of methods from the Biophython package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/biopython/biopython.github.io/">https://github.com/biopython/biopython.github.io/</ext-link>). HHblits hits with an E-value&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;10E<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> were considered important and further processed. Next, the genomic locus of each transcript was extracted and the list of transcripts was sorted accordingly. Transcripts were grouped according to coverage of the query protein, e.g. for Argonaute, two transcripts in close proximity with one encoding the N-terminal and the other encoding the C-terminal part were considered to be an important hit. To further validate the candidate genes, the protein search algorithm of Pfam version 27.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and Panther HMM Sequence Scoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] were employed to identify single important domains in the respective transcripts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>miRNA identification</title><p>The miRNA identification was performed using the novel miRNA identification tool miRA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. miRA does not assume sequence conservation, and was developed to characterize the miRNA landscape in organisms exhibiting heterogeneous miRNA precursor populations.
