However, the oncogenic alterations in coding regions can modify the gene functions without affecting their own expression profiles. Moreover, post-translational modifications can modify the activity of the coded protein without altering the expression levels of the coding gene, but eliciting variations to the expression levels of the regulated genes. These considerations motivate the study of the rewiring of networks co-expressed genes as a consequence of the aforementioned alterations in order to complement the informative content of differential expression. We analyzed 339 mRNAomes of five distinct cancer types to find single genes that presented co-expression patterns strongly differentiated between normal and tumor phenotypes. Our analysis of differentially connected genes indicates the loss of connectivity as a common topological trait of cancer networks, and unveils novel candidate cancer genes. Moreover, our integrated approach that combines the differential expression together with the differential connectivity improves the classic enrichment pathway analysis providing novel insights on putative cancer gene biosystems not still fully investigated.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was partially supported by grants from Regione Puglia PO FESR 2007--2013 Progetto BISIMANE (Cod. n. 44), Progetto FIRB RBAP11B2SX, Progetto di Ricerca Finalizzata 2009 RF/2009-1471624.

One of the most used methods for the study of genetic patterns in cancer tissues is the gene expression profiling via RNAseq or microarray analysis that provides measurements of mRNA levels of the whole genetic landscape in a given biological sample. Generally, diseased tissues are compared with normal controls in order to identify groups of genes whose expression levels are significantly different in the two phenotype conditions and consequently associated to the disease <xref rid="pone.0087075-Tusher1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087075-Liang1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. This population of genes, defined as differentially expressed (DE), is usually considered made of candidate biomarkers for the onset and progression of the pathology and has been widely studied for the identification of disease-related pathways <xref rid="pone.0087075-Subramanian1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087075-Abatangelo1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Although differential expression studies have been widely and successfully applied in many approaches, they present severe shortcomings in the investigation of complex pathologies. A crucial example is represented by carcinogenesis which is a multi-step process involving the gradual accumulation of genetic mutations, that can occur indifferently in regulatory or coding sites of genes. As a matter of fact, the coding region alterations and the post-translational modifications (e.g. phosporylation, acylation, methylation, etc.) can modify the protein activity without affecting the gene expression level, but altering the interaction pattern with other genes.<xref rid="pone.0087075-delaFuente1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. For instance, missense and nonsense mutations in the sites coding for protein binding regions could disrupt several fundamental protein-protein interactions without modifying expression levels. A well-known case of this kind of changes in cancers involves Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC), which is the most common mutated gene in colorectal cancer <xref rid="pone.0087075-Powell1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087075-Fearon1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The most frequent APC mutation leads to a truncated protein that lacks the binding sites for some interacting proteins <xref rid="pone.0087075-Fearnhead1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Therefore, an analysis based uniquely on differential expression studies could be ineffective for the highlighting of some key genetic drivers in neoplastic lesions. On the other hand, another crucial drawback of the differential expression analysis consists in the fact that genes are treated individually, so that interactions are not taken into account. Indeed, it is widely accepted that the comprehension of mechanisms underlying the evolution of genetic disorders like cancer must consider the contribution of interactions among genes <xref rid="pone.0087075-Barabsi1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Furthermore, it is essential to investigate the way these interactions change in the disease phenotype, with respect to the wild-type condition <xref rid="pone.0087075-Bandyopadhyay1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0087075-Ideker1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> since it is well established that not all genes are active in both states. For instance, <xref rid="pone.0087075-Luscombe1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> showed that in response to diverse perturbations the interaction patterns of transcription factors can be altered causing a rewiring of the network.</p><p>In the framework of gene expression profiling, the study of statistically significant correlations between gene pairs can reveal putative interactions, dependencies or coordinated activities of genes in a given biological state. In particular, networks based on gene expression pairwise correlations can represent direct gene regulations and also include genes that are indirectly connected through regulatory pathways <xref rid="pone.0087075-XulviBrunet1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Furthermore, since transcription is the result of a complex multi-level process, an inferred correlation network takes into account not only transcription factor-DNA interactions but also the factors that biochemically regulate the systems. Hence, it is possible to guess that modifications of interactions between genes under different experimental conditions will reflect on diverse correlation pattern outputs. In this picture, recent approaches focused on the identification of the changes in gene co-expression structures (quantified by pairwise correlations) between healthy and diseased tissues to the aim of providing better insights of altered regulation mechanisms and of indicating critical disorder driver genes <xref rid="pone.0087075-delaFuente1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In particular, differential co-expression network analyses have been widely applied and have shown important evidences for the investigation of cancer gene networks <xref rid="pone.0087075-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0087075-West1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and the identification of mutated but not differentially expressed genes <xref rid="pone.0087075-Hudson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>The idea underlying the present study is that modifications of gene connectivity in biological networks are associated to significant phenotypic changes. An encouraging evidence is reported in <xref rid="pone.0087075-Luscombe1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> where the authors found that the connectivity of gene regulation in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> undergoes dramatic alterations during cellular processes. Indeed, they showed that many transcription factors present only a small number of interactions retained across the different conditions, while the remaining connections are active only in specific conditions of the system.</p><p>In the present study, we show that the network connectivity can sensibly change in neoplastic tissues. As a connectivity measure of a gene we used the degree because it is a fundamental observable in graph theory and has a clear biological interpretation <xref rid="pone.0087075-Luscombe1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In particular, we studied the gene interaction changes that emerge in cancer tissues with respect to healthy controls by comparing the specific inferred co-expression networks. To this aim, we investigated on the single nodes that presented a connection structure strongly modified between two biological phenotypes. Non-parametric random permutation tests were adopted in order to highlight those gene having degree variations associated to pathology and not due to chance.</p><p>We found that a loss of connectivity in cancer networks with respect to normal ones is a common trait among the different kinds of cancer. Next, we found that a study of differential connectivity can indicate tumor-related genes not revealed by differential expression analyses. Finally, we showed how the integration of differential expression with differential connectivity can improve the classic enrichment analysis revealing pathways associated to cancer hallmarks and providing insights on novel putative biomarker systems.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>We analyzed expression levels of human 339 mRNAomes including normal and neoplastic tissue samples related to five gene expression datasets of distinct neoplasias from GEO and ArrayExpress: colorectal, lung, gastric, pancreatic and cervical.

To this aim, for each gene, we evaluated the differential connectivity (DC) as difference of gene degrees in the two phenotypic conditions and we assessed its statistical significance with a p-value and a false discovery rate. Moreover, we studied the performance of this measure and its relative merit with respect to the differential expression (DE) in terms of p-value and FDR (see Material and Methods).</p><p>An analysis of FDR as a function of p-values for both differential measures showed that for p-values less than 0.01, there was a proportion of false discoveries below 22% for DC and 10% for DE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087075-g003">Figures 3A-E</xref>). This means that, for both measures, the number of the resulting differential features is significantly higher than would be expected by chance, although the FDR of DC is greater than the FDR of DE for each p-values.</p><fig id="pone-0087075-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0087075.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Benjamini&#x02013;Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) as a function of the p-value.</title><p>Red color represents the differentially expressed genes (DE).

For this reason, we first focused on the classic enrichment study performing a Random-Set-based pathway analysis (see Material and Methods) for the identification of pathways of functionally related genes enriched for differential expression <xref rid="pone.0087075-Hanahan1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.

For all cancers (except for pancreatic case), the comparison of FDRs in the two metrics showed that DE values were always greater than the corresponding DEC ones and the latter resulted less than 15% at a significance level less than 0.01. Furthermore, for colon and lung data sets, the curves of FDR resulted well separated, e.g. taking into account the differential connectivity measure yielded a 91% reduction of FDR value for a p-value of 0.003. As a consequence, we speculated that the pathways involved in tumor biology are deregulated in gene expression and characterized by altered gene interactions not necessarily affecting the expression patterns. A biological validation of this assumption required the assessment of the relative efficiency of the DEC measure in the identification of pathways underlying the general mechanisms and the tissue-specific traits of neoplasias.</p><fig id="pone-0087075-g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0087075.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Comparison between pathway enrichment studies for differential expression and differential connectivity.</title><p>(<bold>A-E</bold>) Benjamini&#x02013;Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) as a function of the p-value.

We therefore note that the exploitation of DEC genes allows to better reveal known cancer pathways. Indeed, the DEC enrichment outperforms the DE analysis both in terms of number of significant pathways and p-values for colon, lung and cervix. The difference between DEC and DE performances was assessed by a random permutation test. In particular, we compared the weighted numbers of significant core set pathways resulting from the two analyses (see Materials and Methods). Although there is a strong evidence of the relative merit of DEC analysis only in colon and lung <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0087075.e062.jpg"/></inline-formula> together with a slight indication for cervix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0087075.e063.jpg"/></inline-formula>, we see that considering DEC genes in pathway enrichment analysis globally unveils more signals associated to the pathology, since the overall significance is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0087075.e064.jpg"/></inline-formula> (see inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087075-g005">Figure 5G</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, we quantified how much the pathway rankings obtained with the two metrics differ from a random ordering in the identification of cancer pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087075-g005">Figure 5H</xref>).

However, it is well established that in complex pathologies like cancer, alterations in the coding regions of genes can influence their functional activities without affecting their own expression levels. In this framework, we hypothesized that co-expression network approaches based on the study of connectivity could reveal those driver genes that change their interactions without a sensible difference in expression.</p><p>For instance, consider a transcription factor (TF) <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0087075.e070.jpg"/></inline-formula> which is co-expressed with a collection <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0087075.e071.jpg"/></inline-formula> of genes in the healthy tissue. Then, suppose that in cancer tissue the TF <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0087075.e072.jpg"/></inline-formula> coding gene turns out to be not differentially expressed while the mutual co-expression with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0087075.e073.jpg"/></inline-formula> is significantly changed (e.g. some connections are removed). Although TF <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0087075.e074.jpg"/></inline-formula> retains its normal expression level in the diseased tissue, its activity has been significantly altered and consequently its regulatory effects acting on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0087075.e075.jpg"/></inline-formula> have been modified (i.e. the expression levels of genes whose promoter regions this transcription factor binds are mutated). In other words, the &#x0201c;rewiring&#x0201d; of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0087075.e076.jpg"/></inline-formula> can be driven by alterations that affect the co-expression with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0087075.e077.jpg"/></inline-formula>, keeping unchanged the expression level of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0087075.e078.jpg"/></inline-formula>. Alterations of this kind are widely known in literature <xref rid="pone.0087075-Benz1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087075-Zheng1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> and can occur according one of the following mechanisms: (1) Mutations in the coding region of A that lead to non-functional protein, i.e. a protein unable to bind the promoter of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0087075.e079.jpg"/></inline-formula>; (2) Alterations in the mechanisms underlying post-translational modifications of TF <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0087075.e080.jpg"/></inline-formula> that inhibit its activity (i.e. ligand interactions, phosphorylation, acetylation, oxidation, glycosylation, etc.). Consequently, we would be not able to reveal a possible role of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0087075.e081.jpg"/></inline-formula> in the disease simply considering its expression levels, while from a differential connectivity point of view we could uncover its activity modifications due to the aforementioned mutations.</p><p>Motivated by these arguments, we introduced the differential connectivity on gene co-expression networks as a measure to identify candidate genes that could have a key role in cancer but that could not be highlighted by a differential gene expression analysis. In particular, we used pairwise correlations as co-expression measure to assess direct and indirect interactions between genes represented in the form of gene networks. It is important to point out that the adopted co-expression measure is able to highlight co-regulation between genes when it is mediated both by protein-coding elements present on the microarray and by non-coding elements not explicitly assayed in the network.</p><p>Our study shows that loss of connectivity in co-expression gene networks is a common trait of cancer tissues and that connectivity-based approaches can highlight novel putative cancer genes. The over-representation of known cancer genes in our findings gives a reasonable prospect that the list of top ranked genes harbours some novel tumor biomarkers not yet recognized. Importantly, in the study of gene biosystems, our connectivity-based method complements and extends the informative content provided by differential expression approaches. Indeed, we found that known pathways involved in tumor biology are enriched of genes characterized by significant alterations either in expression profiles or in their co-expression patterns (DEC).</p><p>Motivated by these findings, we suggest our integrated pathway analysis as a valid hypothesis generator for the discovery of novel cancer-related biosystems. As a matter of fact, an investigation of pathways significantly enriched of DEC genes at level of 0.05 for all cancer datasets provides a picture of the mechanisms that are commonly altered in cancer regardless the tissue type. These pathways include &#x02013; among others &#x02013; gene lists related to the adaptive response and the cytokine signaling in immune system (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0087075.s002">Table S2</xref>).

Consequently, a natural outlook of this work would be a rigorous biological validation that confirms the hypothesis that loss of connectivity fingers toward genes harbouring alterations (e.g. mutations, losses and deletions, promoter DNA methylation) or affected by post-translational modifications (e.g. phosphorylation, acylation, methylation, etc.) in tumours.
