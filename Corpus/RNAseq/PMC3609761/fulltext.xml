Although subtle, this decreasing pH has profound effects on the seawater saturation state of carbonate minerals and is thus predicted to impact on calcifying organisms. Among these are the scleractinian corals, which are the main builders of tropical coral reefs. Several recent studies have evaluated the physiological impact of low pH, particularly in relation to coral growth and calcification. However, very few studies have focused on the impact of low pH at the global molecular level. In this context we investigated global transcriptomic modifications in a scleractinian coral (<italic>Pocillopora damicornis</italic>) exposed to pH 7.4 compared to pH 8.1during a 3-week period. The RNAseq approach shows that 16% of our transcriptome was affected by the treatment with 6% of upregulations and 10% of downregulations. A more detailed analysis suggests that the downregulations are less coordinated than the upregulations and allowed the identification of several biological functions of interest. In order to better understand the links between these functions and the pH, transcript abundance of 48 candidate genes was quantified by q-RT-PCR (corals exposed at pH 7.2 and 7.8 for 3 weeks). The combined results of these two approaches suggest that pH&#x02265;7.4 induces an upregulation of genes coding for proteins involved in calcium and carbonate transport, conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> into HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> and organic matrix that may sustain calcification. Concomitantly, genes coding for heterotrophic and autotrophic related proteins are upregulated. This can reflect that low pH may increase the coral energy requirements, leading to an increase of energetic metabolism with the mobilization of energy reserves. In addition, the uncoordinated downregulations measured can reflect a general trade-off mechanism that may enable energy reallocation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by funds from the American Cancer Society (RSG-08-030-01-CCG) and start-up funds from the OSU Computational and Genome Biology Initiative.

Reef-building corals are key species in coral reefs, providing physical and biological foundations for the ecosystem. The ability of corals to build reefs in oligotrophic tropical oceans is mainly explained by the mutualistic association they form with zooxanthellae (photosynthetic dinoflagellates of the genus S<italic>ymbiodinium</italic>), which produce autotrophically most of the energy required for the calcification process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Allemand1">[1]</xref>.</p><p>Global climate change is impacting on coral reefs, with approximately 19% of reefs worldwide being permanently degraded, 15% showing symptoms of imminent collapse, and another 20% at risk of becoming critically affected in the next few decades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Wilkinson1">[2]</xref>. This alarming level of reef degradation is mainly due to an increase in frequency and intensity of natural and anthropogenic disturbances affecting reefs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Bellwood1">[3]</xref>. Among, these disturbances is ocean pH decrease, also termed &#x0201c;ocean acidification&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Death1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-HoeghGuldberg1">[5]</xref>.</p><p>Several experimental studies have shown that low pH decreases the net calcification rate and skeletal growth of various coral species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Albright1">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Ries1">[15]</xref>. However, in other studies no effects on gross calcification (or an increase) have been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Houlbrque1">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Reynaud1">[18]</xref>. In ecosystems naturally subject to low pH conditions (e.g. CO<sub>2</sub> vents), coral net calcification has been reported to not decrease, or to decrease only slightly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Fabricius1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-RodolfoMetalpa1">[20]</xref>, but at the ecosystem level low pH induces marked community changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Fabricius1">[19]</xref>. In addition to its impact on calcification rates, low pH has been shown to: (i) modify the composition, size, shape and orientation of aragonite crystals in primary polyps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Cohen1">[7]</xref>; and (ii) increase the coral tissue biomass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Krief1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Fine1">[21]</xref>. Contradictory findings have been reported in relation to the effects of low pH on the symbiont component of the coral holobiont. These include findings of a decrease in the density of zooxanthellae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Kaniewska1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Anthony1">[22]</xref>, and effects on their chlorophyll concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Krief1">[11]</xref> and photosynthetic efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Iguchi1">[9]</xref>. On the other hand, these results have been challenged in recent studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Iguchi1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Marubini1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Houlbrque1">[16]</xref>. To date only 2 recent works have explored the transcriptomic response of corals exposed to low pH: a whole transcriptomic analysis on early life history stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Moya1">[23]</xref> and a cDNA microarrays analysis on adults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Kaniewska1">[17]</xref>. Both of these studies were performed on the coral <italic>Acropora millepora</italic> which phylogenetically belongs to the coral &#x0201c;complex&#x0201d; clade which has a less heavily calcified skeletons, and a more porous construction of corallite walls than corals belonging to the &#x0201c;robust&#x0201d; clade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Kitahara1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Romano1">[25]</xref>.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to initiate a whole-transcriptome analysis in the adult scleractinian tropical coral <italic>Pocillopora damicornis</italic> exposed to low pH. Such whole-transcriptome analysis has already successfully been used in studies on the impact of global climate change on coastal organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Moya1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Franssen1">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Runcie1">[28]</xref>. It is also an interesting prerequisite for studies that will target specific biological functions or phenotypic plasticity across populations facing different pH conditions. Finally, RNAseq experiments offer the possibility to highlight unexpected physiological pathways. In the present study we choose to work on the scleractinian tropical coral <italic>P. damicornis</italic> for several reasons: i) it is a major reef-building coral widely distributed in the Indo-Pacific ocean <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Veron1">[29]</xref>; ii) it is naturally confronted to diverse values of ocean pH, ranging from 7.8 in the particular case of volcanic CO<sub>2</sub> vents, to 7.9&#x02013;8.0 in the Eastern tropical Pacific and to 8.1 in other locations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Fabricius1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Manzello1">[30]</xref>; iii) it is known to be highly sensitive to a wide range of natural and anthropogenic disturbances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-BenHaim1">[31]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Loya1">[33]</xref>; iv) it belongs to the &#x0201c;robust&#x0201d; clade which has not yet been studied by transcriptomic approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Kitahara1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Romano1">[25]</xref>. This &#x0201c;robust&#x0201d; clade is characterized by a highly calcified and low porous skeleton compared to corals belonging to the &#x0201c;complex&#x0201d; clade. Taking into account the impact of low pH on calcifying organisms, these last characteristics can lead to different responses to low pH conditions between clades. To address our aims we first assembled the transcriptomes of <italic>P. damicornis</italic> using the result of several RNAseq experiments. In order to maximize the amplitude of the transcriptomic response, an exposure of three weeks to an extreme value of today (volcanic CO<sub>2</sub> vents) or near future natural variability (lower value on the daily variation scale) of pH (7.4) was used and the transcriptome obtained was compared to the control transcriptome (nubbins maintained for three weeks at a current seawater pH of 8.1). After the identification of the biological functions of interest responding to this low pH, a candidate gene approach (by q-RT-PCR) was performed on mRNA from nubbins exposed to a predicted pH of 7.8 and to a very low pH of 7.2 (3 weeks of exposure).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Coral collection, maintenance, and experimental stress</title><p>The <italic>Pocillopora damicornis</italic> (Linnaeus, 1758) isolate used in this study was collected in Lombok, Indonesia (CITES Management Authority, CITES number 06832/VI/SATS/LN/2001-E; Direction de l'Environnement, CITES number 06832/VI/SATS/LN/2001-I).

For experiments, coral explants (3 cm height, 3 cm diameter) from the same parent colony were left to allow tissues to grow over skeleton (recover) for a period of 1 month prior to use in experiments.</p><p>Following recovery, coral nubbins were incubated during 3 weeks into experimental tanks. Temperature (25&#x000b1;0.5&#x000b0;C) was kept constant in each tank using heaters connected to electronic controllers (IKS, Karlsbad, Germany), and seawater was mixed using 2 submersible pumps.

At pH 7.2 the downregulation was maximal and, as it has been observed and hypothesized in other species subjected to extreme physiological stress conditions, this may reflect a trade-off mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Gasch1">[89]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Edge1">[91]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Wang3">[94]</xref>.</p><p>Post-translational protein modification was one of the biological functions downregulated (GO term enrichment analysis, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) during low pH treatment, as evidenced by the substantial downregulation of several genes encoding protein kinases (serine/threonine kinase and tyrosine kinase). Protein kinases phosphorylate proteins to modulate their activity, and play key roles in signal transduction pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Seo1">[95]</xref>. The four protein kinases selected for q-RT-PCR analysis showed similar patterns of expression, with upregulation occurring at pH 7.8 and downregulation occurring at pH 7.4 and 7.2. This variable pattern of transcription could reflect the disturbance or molecular plasticity of signaling in coral cells under stress. Such results are strengthened by a proteomic study of the barnacle <italic>Balanus amphitrite</italic> exposed to low pH. Indeed, under low pH condition the phosphoproteome is modified revealing a regulation of kinase activity and/or synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058652-Wong1">[96]</xref>. The biological effects of all these downregulation events were difficult to resolve because of the very large number of pathways in which kinases are involved, and this will require further study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0058652.s001"><label>File S1</label><caption><p><bold>Biological function, annotation, BlastX top hit species, BlastX evalue, contig number and primer sequence of the selected candidate genes.</bold></p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0058652.s001.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0058652.s002"><label>File S2</label><caption><p><bold>Table results of the GO term enrichment analysis.</bold></p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0058652.s002.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0058652.s003"><label>File S3</label><caption><p><bold>Numerical value corresponding to the qRT-PCR.</bold> Quantification was normalized by comparison with results for exposure to pH 8.1 (present seawater pH); the results are presented as a log2 fold change in expression.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0058652.s003.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Mark Dasenko, Chris Sullivan, and Matthew Peterson at the OSU CGRB core facility for assistance with Illumina sequencing.
