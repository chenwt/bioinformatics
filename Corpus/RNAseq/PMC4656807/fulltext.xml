As homozygous alleles, p53 mutants are differentially associated with specific loss of heterozygosity (R273; chromosome 17); copy number variation (R175H; chromosome 9); and up-stream, cancer-related regulatory pathways. The expression of immune-related cytokines was selectively related to p53 status, showing for the first time that specific p53 mutants impact, and are related to, the immune subtype of ovarian cancer. Although the majority (31%) of HGSCs exhibit loss of heterozygosity, a significant number (24%) maintain a wild-type (WT) allele and represent another HGSC subtype that is not well defined. Using human and mouse cell lines, we show that specific p53 mutants differentially alter endogenous WT p53 activity; target gene expression; and responses to nutlin-3a, a small molecular that activates WT p53 leading to apoptosis, providing &#x0201c;proof of principle&#x0201d; that ovarian cancer cells expressing WT and mutant alleles represent a distinct ovarian cancer subtype. We also show that siRNA knock down of endogenous p53 in cells expressing homozygous mutant alleles causes apoptosis, whereas cells expressing WT p53 (or are heterozygous for WT and mutant p53 alleles) are highly resistant. Therefore, despite different gene regulatory pathways associated with specific p53 mutants, silencing mutant p53 might be a suitable, powerful, global strategy for blocking ovarian cancer growth in those tumors that rely on mutant p53 functions for survival. Knowing p53 mutational status in HGSC should permit new strategies tailored to control this disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>CASP3, caspase 3</kwd><kwd>CDKN1A, cyclin dependent protein kinase 1, P21</kwd><kwd>CNV, copy number variation</kwd><kwd>DNAJC3, DnaJ homolog subfamily C</kwd><kwd>GFP, green fluorescent protein</kwd><kwd>GOF, gain-of-function</kwd><kwd>HGSC, high-grade serous ovarian cancer</kwd><kwd>HOX, homeobox genes</kwd><kwd>LOH, loss of heterozygosity</kwd><kwd>MDM2, mouse double minute 2</kwd><kwd>TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas</kwd><kwd>TP53, tumor protein 53, p53</kwd><kwd>UPR, unfolded protein response</kwd><kwd>WT, wild type</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><title>Introduction</title><p>High-grade ovarian cancer in women is a complex and deadly disease characterized by tumor protein 53 (<italic>TP53</italic>; p53) mutations and genomic instability <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Recent studies have sought to identify subtypes of ovarian cancer for more selective and successful therapeutic strategies. Based on transcriptional profiles provided in The Cancer Gene Atlas (TCGA), high-grade serous ovarian cancer has been divided into specific molecular subtypes <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Based on genomic instability, defects in homologous recombination, and sensitivity to platinum-based therapies, two subtypes have been identified that exhibit either high or low levels of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) or allelic imbalance <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The high-LOH group was further divided into two groups based on high or low sensitivity to platinum therapies. Remarkable in the high-LOH subtype was the consistent and specific loss of chromosome 17 that contains the <italic>TP53</italic> locus. Not only is the loss of chromosome 17 an apparent defining feature in high-grade serous ovarian cancer <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, these tumors have the highest frequency of mutations in the <italic>TP53</italic> gene than any other tumor in women <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Many of these mutations confer gain-of-function (GOF) activities that drive tumor growth independent of wild-type (WT) p53 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Molecular taxonomy studies further verify that the molecular signature of ovarian cancer is distinct from that of other cancers but similar to the tissue of origin <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. These unique characteristics of high-grade serous ovarian cancer indicate that targeting mutant p53 as well as WT p53 might provide new effective, &#x0201c;personalized&#x0201d; therapeutic strategies. In addition, recent analyses of the TCGA data sets, as described herein, indicate that a significant subset of human ovarian tumor samples expresses heterozygous, not homozygous, specific &#x0201c;hot-spot&#x0201d; <italic>TP53</italic> mutants, raising additional questions about targeting therapies for these tumors. Yet the functional activities of different mutant p53 proteins in this heterozygous subtype (compared with WT or homozygous mutant) have not been analyzed in detail in ovarian cancer.</p><p>It is now clear from many studies and analyses of the TCGA data sets not only that are there many p53 mutants in most human cancers but also that not all mutants are structurally and functionally equivalent <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. For example, the R248Q mutant aggregates and is associated with metastasis, whereas the R248W mutant does not aggregate and is less metastatic <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. R175H inhibits cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage, whereas the R175P only blocks cell cycle arrest <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. P53 mutants also exert different phenotypic outcomes whether they are expressed with a WT p53 allele or are expressed with a null allele. For example, the pioneering studies of Olive et al. <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> showed that mice expressing a WT p53 allele with an R175H, R270H, or null allele develop more carcinomas and fewer lymphomas, whereas mice expressing R175H/R175H homozygous alleles do not develop carcinomas but rather develop more sarcomas and lymphomas <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Different p53 mutants also interact with different partners and regulate different pathways: R248Q and R273H (but not R175H) bind the MRE11 nuclease leading to increased genomic instability. R175H, R248, and R273 exhibit distinct gene expression patterns related to different metabolic states in colon cancer cells <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>; R273H appears to be highly related to steroid metabolism <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Using a mouse model of ovarian cancer, we have shown that the functional status of p53 in ovarian epithelial tumors impacts tumor growth, metastasis, and response to steroid hormones <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Specifically, WT p53 promotes papillary tumor growth, whereas depletion of p53 impairs tumor growth <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. These results are consistent with the role of WT P53 as a regulator of cell proliferation in normal and cancer cells <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. However, the p53 null cells are highly sensitive to the steroid hormone estradiol, undergo rampant metastases to the peritoneal cavity, and exhibit some features of high-grade ovarian cancer <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Introduction of the specific p53 mutant R172H into the mouse ovarian tumor cells <italic>in vivo</italic> changes ovarian tumor progression, metastasis, morphology, and response to steroids. Moreover, the tumor phenotype is markedly more aggressive, metastatic, and similar to high-grade ovarian cancer when homozygous R172H mutant alleles are expressed compared with when the mutant is expressed in the presence of a WT allele (heterozygous) (Ren et al., in revision), making these cells a valuable resource for understanding p53 functions in ovarian cancer.</p><p>Clearly, the outcomes of expressing homozygous mutant alleles that exhibit GOF are not equivalent to outcomes associated with loss of p53 alleles <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. This may be dictated, in part, because they can bind to similar interacting partners but lead to diverse outcomes and greater genomic instability <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. These complexities in p53 function have made it challenging to target p53 for therapeutic purposes. However, several small molecules designed to maximally activate WT p53 are currently available and lead to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. One such drug, currently in clinical trials, is nutlin-3a that disrupts the interactions of p53 with mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) leading to increased p53 stability and activity&#x000a0;<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Drugs to reactivate WT p53 functions in mutant p53 protein, such as PRIMA-1, are available and are also being tested <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. However, this approach is not straightforward <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Because p53 mutants acquire their own specific functions and alter tumor functions, disrupting mutant p53 is an alternative attractive approach <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Recent studies have shown in breast cancer and colon cancer cells in culture that disrupting p53 expression using siRNA leads to catastrophic events and cell death in cells expressing mutant p53 without affecting cell viability in cells with WT p53 <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>Based on these considerations, the primary goals of these studies were 1) to use a novel computational approach, termed <italic>Evolutionary Action</italic> (EAp53), which has been developed to stratify p53 mutants as high and low survival risk <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, to identify p53 mutants that are overrepresented in human high-grade ovarian cancer and thus most likely to be exerting functional regulation on tumor cell survival, metastatic activity, and responses to drug therapies and 2) to determine the functional characteristics of the heterozygous versus the homozygous tumor subtypes by expressing or silencing WTp53 or specific p53 mutants overrepresented in ovarian cancer. The small molecule nutlin-3a was used to maximally activate WT p53 in each context <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In addition, p53 siRNA was used to knock down WT and mutant p53 in human and mouse cells to determine the degree of dependence of p53 status on cell survival in each context. Our results provide &#x0201c;proof of principle&#x0201d; that human and mouse ovarian cancer cells expressing one WT allele and one mutant allele are functionally distinct from cells homozygous for either WT or mutant alleles and clearly support previous studies <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Moreover, we show that specific p53 mutants in the presence of a WT p53 allele differentially regulate specific target genes and the responses of cells to nutlin-3a. Thus, knowing the mutant status of TP53 can be used to define the responses of cells to specific drugs and when combined with analyses of LOH could be used to improve the design of new therapeutic approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><title>Cell Lines</title><p><italic>Trp53</italic>(+) cells from <italic>Pten;Kras<sup>G12D</sup>;Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Amhr2-Cre</italic> mice and <italic>Trp53</italic>(&#x02212;) cells from <italic>Trp53<sup>fl/fl</sup>;LSL-Kras<sup>G12D</sup>;Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Amhr2-Cre</italic> mice were isolated and cultured as previously described <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.

The strong bias of these mutations toward high action indicates a strong selection to impact p53 functions overall.</p><p>Next, we focused our analysis on the frequently occurring p53 mutations (observed in more than 1% of the ovarian tumor samples). Compared with all ovarian tumor p53 mutants, this subset has a statistically significant shift in its distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov one-tailed test = .018) away from total loss of function, suggesting that these frequently occurring substitutions maintain some p53 function (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>B</italic>). The frequency of these hot-spot mutations within TP53 was higher in ovarian tumors than in nonovarian tumors for 10 of the 14 mutations and was distributed equally into conformation and DNA binding mutants (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1A</xref>) (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>C</italic>).</p><p>Additional analyses of the TCGA data sets revealed that although some high-grade ovarian cancers exhibit LOH (~&#x000a0;31.3%; <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1B</xref>), this percentage is less than anticipated or assumed. In fact, there are a significant number of tumors that are diploid and express one WT and one mutant allele (~&#x000a0;24%). Among the mutants overrepresented in ovarian cancer, the R273H(9)/R273C(6)/R273L(2)/R273P(1) mutation uniquely has a strong association with heterozygosity (6 out of 18 tumors; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .0158) compared with other mutants, including the most frequently occurring R175H mutation (2 out of 5; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .193). In addition, ovarian cancer is associated with extensive CNV <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. When CNV of tumors was assessed in relation to specific p53 mutations, the analyses revealed that tumors with the TP53p.R175H mutation (8 of 8; 100%) uniquely exhibited a high frequency of copy number loss on chromosome 9 (9q22.1-9q31.1) compared with all other p53 mutants (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>).

These results also indicate that the tumors with the R175H mutant are different from others <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>High-grade serous ovarian cancer is also uniquely associated with specific upstream signaling pathways <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and thus we hypothesized that these pathways might also be related to specific p53 mutations. Further analyses revealed that several unique and commonly activated pathways are strongly associated with p53 mutation status (<xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>; <xref rid="ec0010" ref-type="supplementary-material">Suppl.

Of note, R175 has more unique pathways associated with it than R273, perhaps reflecting the more complex genomic mutational variance in the R175 mutants compared with the R273 mutants that are more likely to be heterozygous for the WT allele (see above). The unique presence of the KMT2A methyltransferase in the R175 tumors indicates that specific epigenetic signatures likely occur in these tumor cells <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> that may involve the expression of specific HOX genes <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.

The H179 mutant is linked to TGF&#x003b2;1 signaling and many inflammatory/immune-related genes, indicating that it is perhaps specifically associated with the immune ovarian cancer subtype <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.

The I195T mutant is strongly associated with estradiol actions as well as with the transcription factors GATA4 and TBX5 <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Distinctively, tumors expressing the I195, Y220, and S241 mutants do not show immune-associated factors and are different from each other and the R179, R174, and R248 tumors.

Collectively, these analyses show 1) that specific TP53 mutants in ovarian cancer are associated with distinct functional characteristics including changes in CNV, LOH, and specific upstream regulatory pathways, the most notable of which are immune and HOX gene related, and 2) that some mutants are preferentially present with a WT p53 allele, representing a new significant subtype of ovarian cancer in which the functional status of the WT allele and the mutant allele needs to be analyzed to determine if therapeutic drugs that target p53 by either deletion of the mutant p53 or activation of WT p53 are effective in this heterozygous tumor type.</p><sec id="s0070"><title>Sensitivity of Human Ovarian Carcinoma Cells to Activation and/or Overexpression of WT TP53 or Knockdown of Endogenous WT or Mutant TP53</title><p>To determine if p53 status (WT, heterozygous, null, or mutant) in human ovarian cancer cell lines determines their expression levels and responses to nutlin-3a, cells were exposed to nutlin-3a alone without (<xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref><italic>A</italic>) or with exogenous WT p53 (<xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref><italic>C</italic>).

Collectively, these results show that basal activity of the WT p53 allele is reduced in the presence of the mutant allele but that the WT allele can be activated by nutlin-3a in this context, leading to apoptosis. Cells that are null for TP53 or that express mutant TP53 are more resistant to nutlin-3a. Although these data support our hypothesis that WT TP53 can be activated in the presence of a mutant allele, results from one human TP53 heterozygous cell line are not sufficient to make a general conclusion.</p><p>Therefore, to test our hypothesis further, we next introduced WT TP53 into the human cell lines using a vector expressing GFP-tagged WT TP53 (<xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref><italic>C</italic>). GFP-WT TP53 protein was highly expressed in all cell lines and did not have a significant effect on endogenous TP53 protein levels in the cell lines analyzed. Western blot analyses showed that WT p53 increased the levels of CDNK1 (P21) protein, a known target of p53, in all cell lines including those expressing homozygous mutant p53, indicating that the WT p53 is active in the presence of the mutant alleles. Nutlin-3a reduced p21 protein levels, indicating that either higher levels of p53 activity are inhibitory or nutlin-3a exerts unknown effects on p21 protein stability (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure&#x000a0;3A</xref>). Cell viability assays showed that exogenous WT TP53 increased cell death in each cell line except the SKOV3 p53 null cells (<xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref><italic>D</italic>). Moreover, we noted that the cell lines OVCA420 and OVCAR3 with homozygous mutant alleles exhibited significantly more rapid and extensive cell death (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001) compared with those (ALST and OVCA533) with WT alleles. Thus, WT TP53 maintains p53 activity in the presence of mutant protein, even in the absence of nutlin-3a; adding nutlin-3a had no further effect on p53 activity and even reduced p21 protein levels (data not shown).

Notably, p53 activity was higher in the presence of R175H, C176Y, I195T, and S241F, the latter two of which are uniquely expressed in ovarian cancer cells. When p53 activity was tested in cells expressing endogenous WT p53, basal activity was highest in the presence of exogenous WT p53 and the C277F mutant but was reduced in the presence of mutant p53. However, two mutants overrepresented in ovarian cancer (Y220C and S241F) and one frequently expressed as a heterozygous allele (R248W) showed higher activity than the other mutants, indicating that these mutants exerted less dominant negative effects on endogenous WT p53 than the other mutants. These data show that specific TP53 mutants overrepresented in ovarian cancer differentially exhibit some WT p53 activity in the p53 null cells and suppress endogenous WT p53 activity in the p53&#x000a0;+ mouse cell lines and support the observation that basal p53 activity was lower in the heterozygous OVCA433 human cell (<xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref><italic>B</italic>).</p><p>To determine the effects of p53 mutants on cell viability, additional cultures with mouse cells expressing endogenous WT p53 were transfected with WT or specific mutant p53 and treated with or without nutlin-3a (<xref rid="f0045" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref><italic>B</italic>). In cells expressing WT p53, the introduction of WT or the p53 mutants did not lead to a major difference in cell viability, with the exception of R179H in which cell viability was significantly higher that WT.

Specific mutants (C277F, R175H, I195T, and S241F) caused even greater decreases in cell viability in the presence of nutlin-3a, indicating that they may potentiate the effects of endogenous p53 activity or have apoptotic functions of their own in cells where WT p53 is activated.

Except for S241F, these mutants also enhanced the suppression of <italic>Hmgb2</italic> in the presence of nutlin-3a. These data indicate that endogenous p53-mediated induction of <italic>p21</italic> mRNA and suppression of <italic>Hmgb2</italic> are maintained or even enhanced by specific p53 mutants. These results further support our hypothesis that, in the heterozygous ovarian cancer subtype, WT TP53 can be activated and its activation by nutlin-3a can even be enhanced, not suppressed, by specific mutants. These results support those observed in the heterozygous human cell lines and highlight the usefulness of nutlin-3a as a therapeutic agent for patients with heterozygous ovarian tumors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0125"><title>Tumor Cell Functions Following Depletion of Mutant p53</title><p>Although nutlin-3a appears to be a useful and effective drug to activate WT TP53 and promote apoptosis of ovarian tumor cells (<xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>) <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, it does not impact ovarian tumor cells expressing homozygous mutants (<xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>) which appear to have acquired specific mechanisms for maintaining cell survival <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Therefore, we next determined if knocking down mutant <italic>TP53</italic> using siRNA (targeting both WT and mutant p53) in the human and mouse cells lines would alter their cell survival&#x02013;promoting functions. Following transfection of p53 siRNA, successful depletion of TP53 protein and its target gene p21 was verified in each cell line by Western blot analyses (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Suppl Figure&#x000a0;3, B&#x02013;D</xref>), and changes in cell viability were analyzed (<xref rid="f0065" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;9</xref><italic>A</italic>). Specifically, human and mouse cells with WT p53 or those heterozygous for WT and mutant alleles or those that were p53 null were less sensitive to p53 siRNA treatment than were the homozygous TP53 mutant cell lines (<xref rid="f0065" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;9</xref><italic>A</italic>). Moreover, the mouse cell lines were less sensitive to p53 siRNA knockdown of p53 and expression of p21 (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Figure&#x000a0;3, C and D</xref>). OVCAR3 cells expressing the R248Q mutant p53 were more sensitive to siRNA than all other cell lines, and almost all cells were dead by 48 hours. Human breast cancer cells with R175H (SK-BR-3) and L194F (T47D) mutant p53 were more sensitive than cells with WT p53 as previously described <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, the breast cancer cells were more resistant than the ovarian cancer cells to siRNA depletion even at 50 nM p53 siRNA. These results indicate that the presence of homozygous R248Q, R273H, or R172H alleles confers a survival advantage and dependency on the mutant p53 protein compared with the other cell lines. To determine the impact of p53 knock down on gene expression in the human cells, RT-PCR was performed to measure p53 target genes, and genes involved in apoptosis and cell stress responses (<xref rid="f0065" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;9</xref><italic>B</italic>). <italic>CDKN1A</italic> was decreased in ALST cells following silencing of WT p53 expression, whereas there was no change in cells with heterozygous mutant p53. By contrast, <italic>CDKN1A</italic> expression was increased by p53 siRNA in OVCA420 cells but to a lesser degree in OVCAR3 cells <xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. <italic>CASP3</italic>, a mediator of apoptosis, and <italic>DNAJC3,</italic> a component of the UPR stress pathway, were highly induced in response to p53 siRNA in OVCA420 (10- and 179-fold, respectively) and OVCAR3 (640- and 250-fold, respectively) but not in cells expressing WT p53. PUMA was increased in the OVCA420 cells but was low in the OVCAR3 cells, indicating that the cells homozygous for the R273H mutation differ from those with the R248Q mutation in this context. Furthermore, p53 siRNA reduced expression of the upstream regulatory factor <italic>SMARCA4</italic> in cells expressing WTp53, had no effect in the p53 null cells, and may increase expression in the R273H homozygous mutant cells. When mouse cells homozygous for the R172H allele were exposed to p53 siRNA, <italic>Casp3</italic> but not <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> expression was increased and is associated with decreased cell viability. Expression of <italic>Puma</italic> and <italic>Dnajc3</italic> was low and not altered, indicating that other pathways appear to be activated in these cells, perhaps relating to the fact that the mouse cells exhibit less genomic instability and are not as susceptible to the UPR. As in the human cells, p53 siRNA reduced expression of <italic>Smarca4</italic> in mouse cells expressing WT p53 but did not alter its expression in the R172H homozygous mutant cells (<xref rid="f0065" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;9</xref><italic>B</italic>), indicating that Smarca4 may be a p53-regulated gene.</p><p>Collectively, these data indicate that cells heterozygous for mutant and WT p53 respond to nutlin-3a and exhibit increased p53 activity, target gene expression, and apoptosis. Conversely, ovarian cancer cells expressing WT p53 can withstand acute removal of p53 and avoid rapid cell death. However, cells dependent on mutant p53 are highly sensitive to either the 1) the removal of the mutant p53 protein leading to a stress-induced cell death or 2) an increase in WT p53 and consequent activation of p53 mediated apoptosis, including increased p21 protein levels.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0100"><title>Discussion</title><p>High-grade epithelial ovarian cancer, unlike other epithelial cancers, is unique because of genomic instability and the vast number of <italic>TP53</italic> mutations that occur in this disease. Hence, it has become imperative to determine how these mutants impact ovarian tumor progression and response to therapeutic drugs. Using evolutionary computer analyses, selected human ovarian cancer cell lines that are homozygous or heterozygous for specific mutants, and tumor cell lines derived from our mouse models expressing WT or mutant alleles, we document herein that 1) specific missense and GOF mutations that are predicted to have biologic function are overrepresented in ovarian cancer; 2) a subset of the most highly represented <italic>TP53</italic> mutations in ovarian tumors is heterozygous for a WT and mutant <italic>TP53</italic> allele and, hence, represent a specific ovarian cancer subtype not previously analyzed in detail; 3) the R273H mutant in particular is more strongly linked to heterozygosity than other mutants; 4) the R175H mutant is uniquely associated with CNV and allelic LOH on chromosome 9; 5) upstream pathways associated with specific TP53 mutants show distinct gene expression differences; 6) p53 activity (luciferase activity, target gene expression, and cell viability in response to nutlin-3a) in tumor cells expressing WT and mutant heterozygous alleles differs from that in cells homozygous for WT or mutant alleles; and 7) cells with homozygous mutant alleles are more sensitive to p53 siRNA than are cells with WT TP53 and exhibit specific apoptotic and UPR-related genes but also show distinct differences in the expression of specific genes associated with specific regulatory pathways.</p><p>Specifically, by interrogating the ovarian cancer TGCA data sets in the context of specific p53 mutations, we have revealed several novel findings relevant to TP53 mutations, their prevalence in ovarian cancer, and their links to CNV and heterozygosity. The data sets also show that upstream pathways <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> linked to specific TP53 mutations exhibit striking differences as well as a few similarities. For example, the R273H mutation has few upstream pathways that are unique, whereas the I195T mutations show high association with estrogen receptor signaling and the R175H mutation is linked to multiple pathways, including retinoic acid signaling. In addition, we show that several TP53 mutations, including R175H, R273H, Y220C, I195T, and S241F, are overrepresented in ovarian cancer and that each exhibits specific functional differences when expressed endogenously or exogenously in the tumor cells. In particular, human tumors with the R175H mutation are associated with a high frequency of CNV in a specific region of chromosome 9. That this occurs in eight of eight tumors analyzed suggests that LOH in this region of chromosome 9 somehow confers early survival advantages to these R175H-expressing tumors. Many of the 124 genes identified in the 9q22.1-33.1 region control DNA repair, cell cycle progression, or tumor suppressor functions; many others are microRNAs that can have global effects in cells.</p><p>The R273H mutation that is strongly linked to heterozygosity (four of nine; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .016) in ovarian tumors also exhibits fewer unique upstream regulatory pathways compared with tumors expressing R175H, R179H, R248Q, and I195T. The presence of both a WT and R273H allele in the tumor samples most likely renders them similar to cells expressing only WT TP53 alleles; R273H enhanced nutlin-3a&#x02013;mediated induction of <italic>Cdnk1a</italic> and suppression of <italic>Hmgb2</italic> in mouse cells expressing WT p53. Evidence presented herein in human and mouse ovarian cancer cells supports previous studies of other tumor types <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and our hypothesis that ovarian tumor cells expressing heterozygous p53 alleles belong to a specific ovarian cancer subtype with specific functional characteristics that may also be dependent on the p53 mutant that is expressed. For example, although the human ovarian cell line that expresses the R273H mutation is homozygous for the mutant allele, data from the OVCA433 cell line expressing one WT allele and one mutant allele show that the presence of one WT allele impacts tumor cell behavior such that the cells respond more like cells with WT p53. Specifically, the human OVCA433 cells exhibit increased p53 (luciferase) activity and <italic>Cdnk1a</italic> and <italic>Mdm2</italic> expression and reduced cell viability in response to nutlin-3a, all targets of WT p53. Moreover, the responses of the OVCA433 cells to nutlin-3a were highly similar to those of the ALST cells expressing only WT TP53. Conversely, the human OVCA420 and OVCAR3 cells that are homozygous for R273H and R248Q alleles, respectively, do not respond or show reduced responses to nutlin-3a.</p><p>As a control, we tested whether or not introducing WT TP53 into the human cell lines would alter their responses without or with nutlin-3a. As expected, WT p53 increased p53 target gene expression (<italic>Cdnk1a, Mdm2</italic>) in each cell line. Although the levels of mRNA were much lower in the OVCA420 and OVCAR3 cells, the fold induction was highly significant, and these cells exhibited more dramatic cell apoptosis than the ALST or OVCA433 cells in response to the exogenous p53. This may be related, in part, to the elevated levels of p21 protein observed in the OVCA420 and OVCAR3 cells. That the elevated levels of p21protein in the SKOV3 cells are not related to enhanced apoptosis further reinforces the distinct phenotype of p53 null cells. That induction of <italic>CASP3</italic> was far greater in the ALST or OVCA433 cells than in the homozygous mutant cells indicates that mechanisms other than, or in addition to, increased expression of <italic>CASP3</italic> are operative in these mutant cells. The increase in PUMA suggests that WT p53 selectively increases this apoptotic-related gene in the homozygous mutant cells. It is also possible that the WT p53 blocks specific survival pathways in the mutant cells. To analyze this, we treated each cell line with p53 siRNA to deplete endogenous mutant p53. Whereas the cells expressing WT TP53 showed some increase in cell death, the homozygous mutant cells exhibit more dramatic increases in apoptosis. In the homozygous mutant cells but not in the cells expressing WT TP53, expression of <italic>DNAJC3</italic>, a gene involved in the unfolded protein stress response, was dramatically induced; <italic>CASP3</italic> also increased, but the TP53 target <italic>PUMA</italic> was not induced. Collectively, these results indicate that WT p53 is functional in the mutant cells and appears to induce a specific set of genes that, combined with the loss of mutant p53, leads to distinct cellular responses and cell death in the homozygous mutant cells.</p><p>Data obtained in parallel from our mouse ovarian cancer cell lines extend and provide further support for the distinct functional activities of tumor cells expressing heterozygous versus homozygous 53 alleles and thus emphasize the importance of understanding the functional characteristics of the heterozygous tumor phenotype. Specifically, the data obtained in the mouse ovarian cancer cells document that although all of the p53 mutants tested suppressed basal p53 activity as measured by luciferase assays with a &#x0201c;consensus&#x0201d; p53 promoter element, some were more potent than others. In addition, the mutants exerted their own specific effects on p53 target gene expression in the <italic>Trp53&#x000a0;+</italic> cells. For example, we document that one p53 GOF and DNA binding mutant, R248W, which is overrepresented in ovarian cancer, suppressed endogenous WT p53-mediated luciferase activity and <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> mRNA expression but had no effect on <italic>Hmgb2</italic> expression and unexpectedly enhanced nutlin-3a activation of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> mRNA expression and suppressed <italic>Hmgb2</italic> expression. In addition, the H179R mutant exerted similar effects to those of the R248W mutant on WT p53 activity and gene expression, indicating that these distinctly different mutants can impact WT p53 activity in a similar manner in this context, perhaps involving similar interacting partners <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The S241F mutant provides another interesting example. It is highly overrepresented in ovarian tumors, its functional activities have not been analyzed, and no human ovarian cancer cell lines express this mutant. However, the S241F mutant 1) suppresses WT p53 activity in luciferase assays but not as much as other mutants, 2) suppresses <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> mRNA expression, and 3) more potently suppresses <italic>Hmgb2</italic> mRNA than WT p53 in the <italic>Trp53&#x000a0;+</italic> cells. Moreover, S241F enhances nutlin-3a activation of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> expression but does not alter nutlin-3a effects on <italic>Hmgb2</italic> expression. Thus, the S241F mutant exerts both p53 activity and p53 antagonistic activity depending on context. Maybe it binds MDM2, protecting WT p53 from degradation. Collectively, these data show that specific p53 mutants can modulate WT p53 functional activities and thus tumor cell behavior in response to nutlin-3a, thereby confirming and extending results of others showing that different p53 mutants are not functionally equivalent <xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. The ability of some mutants to retain WT p53 activity likely relates to their ability to bind similar p53 response elements in the target genes, whereas the ability of mutants to block p53 activity likely prevents WT p53 from targeting p53 consensus sites on target genes.</p><p>Furthermore, we have recently generated mice expressing the R172H (R175H in humans) allele. Tumors expressing either heterozygous or homozygous R172H alleles develop rapidly in these mice and exhibit markedly different phenotypes (Ren et al., in revision). Herein we show that cells derived from the heterozygous tumors or from tumors homozygous for the R172H allele exhibit increased p53 activity, as measured by <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> and <italic>Mdm2</italic> mRNA expression, in response to exogenous WT p53 expression and nutlin-3a treatment (<xref rid="f0045" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>). Moreover, the mouse data show clearly that cells homozygous for the R172H/R172H mutant protein do not totally suppress exogenous WT p53 activity. Furthermore, when the R175H mutant was expressed in the <italic>Trp53&#x000a0;+</italic> cells (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>, <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>), it did not suppress basal or nutlin-3a <italic>Cdnk1a</italic> induction. Like the human cells, the homozygous R172H mutant mouse cells are sensitive to p53 siRNA, exhibit increased <italic>Casp3</italic>, and undergo cell death. That cell death is not as dramatic in the mouse cells as in the human cells may be related to the absence of an unfolded protein response and lack of induction of <italic>Dnajc3</italic> or to the different genetic backgrounds of these cells. Like the human cells, the mouse cells expressing WTp53 are relatively insensitive to p53 siRNA.</p></sec><sec id="s0105"><title>Conclusions</title><p>These studies document that specific p53 missense and GOF mutations are selectively overrepresented in high-grade ovarian cancer. As homozygous alleles, specific mutants are differentially associated with specific LOH (chromosome 17) <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, CNV (R175H; chromosome 9), and specific upstream (SMARCA4, estrogen, retinoic acid, TGF&#x003b2;) and cancer-related (<italic>TBX2/5, HOXA5, HOXA9</italic>, and <italic>PPARG</italic>) regulatory pathways. Of particular relevance, expression of immune-related cytokines was selectively related to p53 status, showing for the first time that p53 mutant status impacts, and is related to, the immune subtype <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref> of ovarian cancer.

Each mutant also differentially alters endogenous WT p53 activity, target gene expression, and responses to nutlin-3a, providing &#x0201c;proof of principle&#x0201d; that ovarian cancer cells expressing both a WT and mutant allele represent a distinct ovarian cancer subtype. Using human ovarian cancer cell lines with known p53 status, we show that 1) nutlin-3a activates WT p53 in the presence of mutant p53; 2) reintroduction of WT p53 into human cell lines that are homozygous for specific p53 mutants leads to target gene expression, elevated levels of p21 protein, and apoptosis even without nutlin-3a; and 3) knock down of endogenous p53 in cells expressing homozygous mutant alleles causes a stress-induced UPR and apoptosis. Despite different gene regulatory pathways associated with specific mutants, silencing mutant p53 might be a suitable and powerful strategy for blocking tumor growth in ovarian cancers that rely on mutant p53 functions for survival <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.
