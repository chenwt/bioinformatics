    "Nonlinear responses to signals are widespread natural phenomena that affect various cellular processes. Nonlinearity can be a desirable characteristic for engineering living organisms because it can lead to more switch-like responses, similar to those underlying the wiring in electronics. Steeper functions are described as ultrasensitive, and can be applied in synthetic biology by using various techniques including receptor decoys, multiple co-operative binding sites, and sequential positive feedbacks. Here, we explore the inherent non-linearity of a biological signaling system to identify functions that can potentially be exploited using cell genome engineering. For this, we performed genome-wide transcription profiling to identify genes with ultrasensitive response functions to Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF). We identified 3,527 genes that react to increasing concentrations of HGF, in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, grown as cysts in 3D collagen cell culture. By fitting a generic Hill function to the dose-responses of these genes we obtained a measure of the ultrasensitivity of HGF-responsive genes, identifying a subset with higher apparent Hill coefficients (e.g. MMP1, TIMP1, SNORD75, SNORD86 and ERRFI1). The regulatory regions of these genes are potential candidates for future engineering of synthetic mammalian gene circuits requiring nonlinear responses to HGF signalling."
