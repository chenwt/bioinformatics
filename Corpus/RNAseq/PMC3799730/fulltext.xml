In the original observations made by Brown and Brown in 1965, successive waves of <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> parasitemia in rhesus macaques exhibited distinct antigenic profiles, as based on the agglutination of schizont-infected erythrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] indicating that immunogenic targets on the surface of the infected erythrocytes changed antigenically during the course of an infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These variant antigens were named for the assay that detected them, Schizont Infected Cell Agglutination (SICA) antigens. Specific SICA agglutinating and opsonizing antibodies were shown to factor into proposed mechanisms of immunity being raged to fight the infection in these monkey hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. A series of phenotypically distinct <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> SICA[+] clones were subsequently generated by the <italic>ex vivo</italic> micromanipulation of single schizont iRBC to infect monkeys and effect their <italic>in vivo</italic> propagation in na&#x000ef;ve animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. When passaged in pre-exposed/immunologically boosted rhesus macaques, a switch in variant antigen expression was observed; newly developed clones derived therefrom had unique iRBC surface antigenic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These clones were key to demonstrate the clonal nature of the antigenic variation and they enabled the experimental identification of the SICA variant antigens as high molecular weight (~200 kDa) parasite-encoded proteins that were extractable in SDS, and predicted to be inserted in the membrane of the RBC with exposure on the surface of the infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The analogous protein in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (Erythrocyte Membrane Protein 1; PfEMP1) was identified based on similar procedures and considerations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. PfEMP1 is responsible not only for antigenic variation in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref> but the cytoadherence and sequestration of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> iRBCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and associated malarial pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Sequestration is also known to occur in <italic>P. knowlesi</italic>, but to a much lesser degree and in different tissue locations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>In splenectomized rhesus macaques, <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> iRBCs lose expression of the SICA variant antigens at the surface and concomitantly result in less virulent infections that are readily controlled in spleen-intact rhesus macaques if SICA is not expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. If these parasites (called SICA[-]) re-express the SICA antigen at the surface of the host RBCs when returned to an intact animal, they regain a high level of virulence that can result in an overwhelming parasitemia and death of the animal if not treated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These observations bring emphasis to the importance of the spleen in regulating variant antigen expression, yet the mechanism(s) involved has remained unknown. The original studies also did not address whether the SICA protein was produced but not transported to the surface of the infected host cells, or not produced at all. Other studies performed with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in intact or splenectomized <italic>Saimiri sciureus</italic> monkeys also demonstrated that the spleen modulates the expression of the variant antigens in this species also, which are associated with cytoadherence and sequestration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. A few clinical case studies with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infections in splenectomized humans also indicate that in the absence of a spleen the cytoadherent properties of iRBCs largely disappear, which would correspond to the down regulation of the variant antigens that are involved in the cellular adhesion and sequestration of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> iRBCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>. Another analysis from fatal cases of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> evaluates the potential immunological host-parasite interactions within the spleen involving trophozoite or schizont infected RBCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> SICA[+] clone denoted as Pk1(A+) is the parent of the Pk1(B+)1+ clone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] derived through an <italic>in vivo</italic> conducted antigen switch and recloning. The Pk1(A+) and Pk1(B+)1+ parasite clones (and their SICA[-] progeny) share the same genotype; the only genetic difference known so far is due to a mitotic recombination event that resulted in distinctly different cytoplasmic domains and 3&#x02019;UTRs for the respective 205A and 205B <italic>SICAvar</italic> gene alleles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The <italic>in vivo</italic> induced switch from the Pk1(A+) to Pk1(B+)1+ phenotype was the direct result of the parasite&#x02019;s ability to change in the face of an immune response against the SICA antigens expressed at the surface of the Pk1(A+) iRBCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Antisera raised against the Pk1(A+) iRBCs did not crossreact with the Pk1(B+)1+ iRBCs and vice versa. Using both metabolic and surface radioiodination labeling methods, these clones were shown on SDS-PAGE gels to express distinct SICA protein doublets of 210/190 kDa and 205/200 kDa, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]; a few minor clone-specific bands were also observed that differed between the clones and depending on the labeling method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. After many short-term (&#x0003c; 1 week) passages propagating the parasite in na&#x000ef;ve rhesus monkeys, typically done to maintain long-term frozen stocks, the respective clonal populations maintained the expression of the major protein phenotypes [29,30]. Whether the two major protein bands of each phenotype represent two distinct proteins or processed products, whether other minor protein bands observed corresponded to related or novel variant proteins, and whether they were in fact co-expressed on each iRBC, remained open questions [8,10]. When the first <italic>SICAvar</italic> gene was identified and characterized, subtractive immunoprecipitation experiments with specific antibody reagents supported the view that the two protein bands represented two distinct proteins [29]. Importantly, related SICA[-] clones denoted as Pk1(A-)1- and Pk1(B-)1-, created from passage in splenectomized rhesus macaques, did not express these antigens at the surface of the iRBCs, as determined by agglutination assays and comparable radiolabelled immunoprecipitation experiments [9].</p><p>The gene encoding the 205 kDa SICA protein expressed by the Pk1(B+)1+ parasites was reported in 1999 with the discovery of the <italic>SICAvar</italic> multigene gene family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. This report described the complex multi-exon <italic>SICAvar</italic> gene structure with extensive diversity in the context of seven cysteine-rich domains and a conserved cytoplasmic domain encoded by the final exon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. With the advent of the <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> genome sequencing project, data mining with a special focus on the conserved cytoplasmic domain encoding regions and the 3&#x02019;UTRs predicted 108 <italic>SICAvar</italic> genes and defined elaborate conserved 3&#x02019;UTR sequences with sequential &#x02018;Blocks&#x02019; defined by repeats (Block I), A/T homopolymers (Block II), and a GC rich-domain (Block III) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. These studies confirmed that <italic>SICAvar</italic> transcripts encoding 205 alleles (among others) were produced in both the Pk1(A+) and Pk1(B+)1+ iRBCs, despite that lack of expression of the 205kDa protein in the Pk1(A+) parasites; qRT-PCR data suggested that a processing event between Blocks II and III may have resulted in the inactivation of the <italic>205A</italic> allele transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The <italic>SICAvar</italic> gene encoding the 205 kDa SICA protein was originally defined by a 10-exon structure within an approximate 14 kb segment of genomic DNA, and this was recently redefined with a total of 12 exons. The redefined gene was shown to be centrally located on chromosome 5 and includes the true 5&#x02019;UTR and two distant upstream exons, separated from the original 10-exon sequence by a large 12 kb repeat-laden intron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]; such large upstream introns are common to a subset of <italic>SICAvar</italic> genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The <italic>P. falciparum</italic>
<italic>var</italic> genes in stark contrast have evolved to have only two exons. The expressed proteins of the <italic>SICAvar</italic> and comparable <italic>var</italic> gene families from <italic>P. falciparum</italic> are biochemically and functionally analogous as variant antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], and shown to be related by proteomics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], despite a high degree of inherent diversity. A recent evolutionary analysis of these and other multigene families across species also supports the ancestral relationship of <italic>SICAvar</italic> and <italic>var</italic> genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The first exon of <italic>var</italic> genes encodes protein sequences that represent the external part of the variant antigens, comparable to all but the final exon of the <italic>SICAvar</italic> genes: in both species the bulk of each variant antigen gene encodes a series of cysteine-rich domains followed by a transmembrane domain in the penultimate exon and the final exon encodes a highly conserved cytoplasmic domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. </p><p>Continued investigation of the structure and expression of the <italic>SICAvar</italic> gene family in parallel with the <italic>var</italic> gene family is important for studying the mechanism of antigenic variation in the context of the host, but this has been a challenge, despite the publication of the first <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> genome sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This is because of the complex multi exon-intron structures, extensive homology amidst diversity in the exons, many large A-T rich introns, and UTRs with extensive repeat sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. All of these factors have made it difficult to accurately link the coding and non-coding sequences comprising each gene and appropriately assign these genes to the parasite&#x02019;s 14 chromosomes in order to study the gene expression of this family. A majority of the <italic>SICAvar</italic> genes in fact currently remain in fragments in the <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> database (222 out of the 244 annotated <italic>SICAvar</italic> and <italic>SICAvar</italic>-like sequences) including the prototype 12-exon <italic>SICAvar</italic> gene described above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Therefore, at this stage, traditional gene-walking methods must still be relied on to verify data coming from post-genomics research, including proteomics, as reported here. </p><p>The overall aim of this study was to understand the basic molecular definition of SICA[-] parasites generated in splenectomized rhesus monkeys with regards to the expression of the <italic>SICAvar</italic> gene family (based on the Pk1(A-)1- and Pk1(B-)1- cloned populations), and develop complementary baseline SICA[+] proteomes for the Pk1(A+) and Pk1(B+)1+ clonal populations to support investigations on the mechanism of variant antigen switch events. This study shows that <italic>SICAvar</italic> genes are transcribed in SICA[-] parasites, though at a much lower level compared to SICA[+] parasites, as evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR. Of particular importance, full-length <italic>SICAvar</italic> transcripts were not evident in SICA[-] RNA on northern blots, and SICA protein was not detected in SICA[-] iRBCs by Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We have concluded that in the absence of the spleen, there is a complete downregulation of SICA protein expression, which is dependent on some combination of <italic>SICAvar</italic> transcription regulatory mechanisms and possible post-transcriptional control processes; antisense transcripts may also play a role. Moreover, we have classified the Pk1(A+) and Pk1(B+)1+ clonal populations by distinct repertoires of SICA antigens, with apparent dominant and minor expressed proteins. This knowledge provides a new starting point for in depth studies on the molecular mechanisms that govern the genetic and epigenetic expression and switching of <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> variant antigen genes, transcripts and proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> and future comparative studies with <italic>P. falciparum</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>SICA proteins are not detected in SICA[-] parasites</title><p>Specific antibodies to any region of the SICA proteins were not available at the time when SICA[-] parasites were first identified, and thus it has remained an open question whether these parasites do not make any protein or whether it is produced but not transported to the surface of the iRBCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. To answer this question we made use of specific antiserum generated against the conserved final exon cytoplasmic domain encoding sequences from the <italic>205B SICAvar</italic> allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. BLAST searches using this sequence had predicted 108 <italic>SICAvar</italic> genes in the <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and the antiserum was predicted to react with all expressed SICA proteins. When tested by IFA, the pan-SICACyto antiserum was positive as expected on all SICA[+] trophozoite-infected RBCs but negative on SICA[-] trophozoite-infected RBCs with only an occasional, spurious fluorescing iRBC observed in the blood smears (not shown). These data were corroborated by the absence of SICA protein detection by immunoprecipitation and LC-MS/MS experiments. </p><p>Initially, extracts of metabolically labeled Pk1(B+)1+ and Pk1(B-)1- late-stage trophozoites were immunoprecipitated with IgG antibodies purified from another antiserum raised against the <italic>205B SICAvar</italic> allele cytoplasmic domain, called Cyto17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. High molecular weight SICA proteins in the 200 kDa range were evident in the Pk1(B+)1+ parasites, but not in the Pk1(B-)1- parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078014-g001">Figure 1</xref>). These studies focused on the Pk1(B+)1+ and the Pk1(B-)1- clones, since only the gene encoding the 205 kDa SICA protein characteristic of the Pk1(B+)1+ parasites had been confirmed and reported in the in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In pilot experiments based on less sensitive MS/MS methods, SICA protein was likewise not detected from either Pk1(A-)1- or Pk1(B-)1- samples. In these studies, whole trophozoite extracts and purified trophozoite-infected RBC membranes were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by gel extraction, trypsin treatment of Coomassie-stained bands, and tandem MS analysis, as performed in previous proteomic investigations of SICA and its relationship with PfEMP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In contrast to the SICA[+] samples, showing positive hits to <italic>SICAvar</italic> gene identifications (IDs), no significant hits to <italic>SICAvar</italic> gene IDs were obtained from any SICA[-] samples. The direct approach of immunoprecipitating SICA proteins prior to LC-MS/MS analysis was undertaken to best ensure the detection of any SICA proteins in these parasites, knowing that SICA proteins are not abundant at the surface of infected host cells and proteins expressed at low levels could go undetected if masked by other more abundant proteins. When immunoprecipitates from either Pk1(A-)1- or Pk1(B-)1- parasites were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis, no SICA peptides were identified.</p><fig id="pone-0078014-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0078014.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>SICA protein profile from Pk1(B+)1+ and Pk1(B-)1- immunoprecipitations.</title><p>Trophozoite SDS extracts were immunoprecipitated with purified IgG from an antiserum (Cyto17) (Al-Khedery, 1999) that is specific for the SICA conserved cytoplasmic domain.

This ID represents an 8-exon <italic>SICAvar</italic> fragment, which includes the final conserved exon that encodes the protein&#x02019;s cytoplasmic domain and seven upstream exons. There is a sequence gap immediately upstream of this 8-exon fragment, which is followed by gene ID PkH_072700: with a PEXEL-containing, 2-exon <italic>SICAvar</italic> fragment. As in our previous investigations redefining the <italic>205B SICAvar</italic> allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], we confirmed the continuity of these sequences by RT-PCR. Thus, we report here that the predominantly expressed Pk1(A+) <italic>SICAvar</italic> mRNA transcript is encoded in a 10-exon <italic>SICAvar</italic> gene, represented in the published genome by neighboring gene IDs PkH_072700 and PkH_072710 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078014-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). </p><p>Another gene fragment, PkH_040620, corresponded to the second most abundant SICA protein in the Pk1(A+) trophozoite-infected RBCs.

We therefore have concluded that the rest of this <italic>SICAvar</italic> gene sequence is missing from the current genome assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], similar to another sequence we reported previously as missing (corresponding to the 3&#x02019; region of the <italic>205B SICAvar</italic> allele, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]). We therefore have no means to determine the identity of the remainder of this gene at this time and we cannot complete the sequence by gene-walking methods. Still, based only on the initial 2-exon sequence, the LC-MS/MS generated BLAST search identified the PkH_040620 encoded SICA protein as a predominant hit. If this entire multi-exon <italic>SICAvar</italic> sequence were present in the genome database, we predict that this protein would have been recognized in even greater abundance, and in turn represented by a larger segment in the pie chart, perhaps comparable to ID PkH_072710 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078014-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).

The evidence is clear when one investigates <italic>P. knowlesi SICAvar</italic> transcripts from SICA[+] parasites that had been grown in intact rhesus monkeys in comparison with those from SICA[-] parasites generated in splenectomized animals. . Critically, there is an obvious abundance of full-length <italic>SICAvar</italic> transcripts detected by northern blot in the SICA[+] samples, and the complete lack of such signals in SICA[-] samples. On first appearances, these data could suggest that transcription of <italic>SICAvar</italic> genes is completely silenced in the splenectomized host. An alternative interpretation could be that <italic>SICAvar</italic> transcripts can be produced in the SICA[-] parasites but they become rapidly processed or degraded. Stage-specific qRT-PCR experiments in fact suggest that such processing may be occurring, as a low-level of 5&#x02019; and 3&#x02019; designed transcript amplicons can be detected by qRT-PCR in SICA[-] RNA; the presence of putative specific regulatory non-coding RNAs may also explain these results. Notably, such <italic>SICAvar</italic> products were detected at significantly lower levels in the Pk1(A-)1- and Pk1(B-)1- RNA samples than in their SICA[+] counterparts. The level detected in the SICA[-] ring-stage RNA was in fact comparable to that found in SICA[+] trophozoite RNA, which is always minimal in comparison and only weakly visible on northern blots compared to strong SICA[+] ring-stage signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078014-g005">Figure 5</xref>) and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The transcriptional origin and nature of these SICA[-] RNA segments remain to be explored in detail. This will be possible in the near future with the availability of an updated <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> genome sequence database with an improved assembly of the <italic>SICAvar</italic> genes and stage-specific RNAseq data (unpublished data). We have similarly observed a major reduction in <italic>SICAvar</italic> transcript signals in global microarray profiles from parasites grown in splenectomized animals or <italic>in vitro</italic> culture (unpublished data). </p><p>The absence of full-length <italic>SICAvar</italic> signals on northern blots with SICA[-] ring-stage samples is likely to be attributed to some degree of transcriptional repression in the SICA[-] parasites, and may involve epigenetic mechanisms comparable to those being discovered with regards to <italic>var</italic> gene regulation in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Importantly, our data supports the proposition that the spleen (and possibly other host factors working in synergy) is critical for <italic>SICAvar</italic> transcription, and, we predict, the accumulation and maintenance of full-length <italic>SICAvar</italic> transcripts targeted for translation. qRT-PCR data confirming the presence (though vastly reduced amounts) of PCR-targeted transcript segments, suggests multifactorial synergistic and well-honed molecular processes. We predict that transcriptional control mechanisms as well as post-transcriptional gene-silencing tactics may result in the stage-specific maintenance of the low level of <italic>SICAvar</italic> transcript sequences that are detectable by qRT-PCR in the absence of the spleen. </p><p>The natural turnover of RNA observed in the <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> intra-erythrocytic development cycle (IDC) from SICA[+] parasites does not simply result in degraded RNA. This point is illustrated by the presence of as many as 22 <italic>SICAvar</italic> transcripts (corresponding to the last few exons) represented in a Pk1(B+)1+ cDNA library produced with RNA from late trophozoite and early schizont-stage parasites.(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078014.s003">Figure S2</xref>) and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. It is noteworthy that this set of cDNAs did not have a predominant sequence, and in fact, only four corresponded to the <italic>205 SICAvar</italic> allele known to produce protein in the Pk1(B+)1+ parasites. Furthermore, the putative products encoded by the majority of these cDNAs were not identified via gene ID hits in the LC-MS/MS experiments reported here in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078014-g005">Figure 5</xref>. These <italic>SICAvar</italic> gene transcripts clearly were not destined to be translated. Hints of translational repression have also been revealed in principle by evidence that <italic>SICAvar</italic> transcripts detected by microarrays are not necessarily expressed as protein (unpublished data). As postulated earlier for SICA[+] parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], it appears that some form of <italic>SICAvar</italic> RNA post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism(s) may be operating in both SICA[+] and SICA[-] parasites to achieve translational repression. Additional research is warranted in this area.

Such studies would also be valuable with <italic>P. coatneyi</italic>, a simian malaria parasite that is closely related to <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], but which expresses &#x02018;knobs&#x02019; and characteristics of cytoadherence and deep vascular sequestration like <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>. <italic>Plasmodium coatneyi</italic> has a large multigene family with multi-exon structural features similar to the <italic>SICAvar</italic> genes and may be similarly regulated in macaques. <italic>Plasmodium fragile</italic> is likely to have a similar family, based on prior knowledge of antigenic variation in this related simian malaria species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. The strategic use and comparison of these various <italic>in vivo</italic> non-human primate models may facilitate our understanding of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>
<italic>var</italic> gene expression, regulation, and pathogenesis. Interestingly, preliminary evidence is also materializing to show that placental tissue may be important to regulate the expression of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>
<italic>var</italic> genes that are expressed during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>In light of our data showing many transcript sequences are produced in SICA[+] parasites, without all of them necessarily being translated, the data of Wang et al. 2009 is intriguing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. This group has reported the detection of <italic>var</italic> transcripts representing 90% of the <italic>var</italic> gene family in the blood of a malaria naive vaccine trial volunteer who had been infected with <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, NF54 strain sporozoites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. This study and its interpretation could appear contrary to the basic tenet of antigenic variation and immune evasion; i.e., that mechanisms are in place to prevent the expression of all but one variant protein from the family at the same time. Wang and others suggested that the parasite population may express most or all <italic>var</italic> genes early on in an infection and that selection defined by cytoadherence to receptors or adhesion-blocking antibodies may then take place to ultimately result in the mutually exclusive expression of specific <italic>var</italic> types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. It remains unclear how such selection processes would become limited to the expression of one (or a few) PfEMP1 when the family shares various combinations of cysteine-rich domains, many with common adhesive characteristics, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>. It also remains unknown how switches would then occur over time to develop chronic infections, characteristic of the process of antigenic variation and predicted to involve both inducing and opsonizing antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Based on the original studies and ongoing data coming from the <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> model system, we again put forth the alternative and potentially complementary view that most if not all <italic>SICAvar</italic> genes are transcribed (in some form) and certain genes become upregulated in the host blood-stage infection, as a rule (dependent upon some splenic factor), but that the majority of the transcripts are then silenced, leaving only those that are destined to be translated as intact messages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. This possibility, which would prevent the rapid expression and exposure of the variant family to the immune system, had been proposed by Piet Borst as one option for how <italic>P. falciparum</italic> may control expression of the <italic>var</italic> multigene family and its proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. With this scenario, variant type switches would remain the outcome of an antibody induced process, along with splenic factors that determine the state of gene expression. More recent reviews by Piet Borst reflect upon various mechanistic possibilities and many questions still in need of answers for <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and other organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>].</p><p>The majority of studies on the mechanisms of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>

While clearly challenging for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> studies, the importance of studying antigenic variation in the context of the host environment has been stressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>] and an increasing number of studies over the last decade have aimed to compare, contrast, and model results generated from <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>ex vivo</italic> iRBC samples acquired from human <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. Such studies are also beginning to recognize the potential impact on <italic>var</italic> gene expression and switching depending on whether individuals are na&#x000ef;ve and experiencing a more severe case of malaria or have previous exposure to the parasite and some degree of adaptive immunity. </p><p>We provide evidence for the first time that SICA[-] parasites do not produce SICA proteins, consistent with the lack of detectable full-length <italic>SICAvar</italic> transcripts in SICA[-] parasite RNA. Most telling, we have used sensitive LC-MS/MS proteomic methods to confirm that SICA protein is not present in SICA[-] trophozoite-infected RBCs. It is known that when cloned SICA[-] parasites are reinoculated into an intact rhesus monkey SICA expression at the surface of the iRBCs can be reinstated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Future directions include investigating what SICA proteins become expressed under these &#x02018;reactivation circumstances&#x02019; or after passage through mosquitoes and defining the mechanistic processes and controls. Another major finding presented here is that the SICA antigenic switch from the Pk1(A+) phenotype to the Pk1(B+)1+ phenotype is &#x02018;complete&#x02019;, in that none of the SICA proteins detected in the parent clone are detected in the progeny clone. The complete change in protein expression is quite impressive. This switch can be defined as a dramatic shift in expression and not the result of the progression and selection of iRBCs that have drifted in their expression characteristics.</p><p>Among the <italic>SICAvar</italic> gene IDs detected by LC-MS/MS, curiously, PkH_040630 (detected with two unique peptides) represents an isolated 2-exon sequence with a PEXEL motif and start and stop codons. The PkH_040630 sequence is immediately upstream from PkH_040620 on the antisense strand. This small sequence lacks the majority of a typical SICA protein including the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain that would be recognized by the pan-SICAcyto antiserum used for the immunoprecipitation reactions, but it may have been pulled down in a complex. Another possibility is that PkH_040630 may have been alternatively spliced to <italic>SICAvar</italic> exons downstream of PkH_040620. The published sequence downstream, however, is truncated by a gap, leaving this an open question.</p><p>We have presented a compendium of expressed <italic>SICAvar</italic> genes and proteins for the first time to define the classic Pk1(A+) and Pk1(B+)1+ cloned populations. These data reveal that these parasites cannot be strictly defined by two SICA proteins representing the high molecular weight protein doublets originally observed by SDS-PAGE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Nevertheless, they continue to express specific predominant SICA proteins, and in particular the originally defined 205 kDa SICA protein in the Pk1(B+)1+ parasites, even after many passages over time through intact rhesus monkeys; thus, overall, these clones can be viewed as stable with regards to their SICA expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. It remains unknown whether each of the proteins detected by LC-MS/MS is actually expressed on the surface of the respective infected RBCs. Each of the SICA proteins was identified by unique peptides, thus we are confident they were expressed, but there is presently no evidence of the transport of every protein to the surface of the infected host cells. Such investigations will require the development of specific non-crossreacting antibody reagents, which are a challenge to produce for members of the SICA family. Attempts at expressing specific recombinant SICA proteins to develop specific antibodies and study the expression at a cellular and population level have been complicated by 1) the high degree of conserved sequences across the family and 2) the facts that SICA recombinant proteins tend to be insoluble and may not represent the natural conformation of the antigens. Proteomic and cell biological analyses of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites have shown that multiple EMP1 variant antigens can be detected on the surface of infected erythrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]. In addition, a transgenic system expressing truncated PfEMP1 proteins showed that more than one PfEMP1 could be exported to the RBC surface. Thus, there does not seem to be a mechanistic barrier preventing the expression of multiple variant antigens on infected cell membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>].</p><p>We envision multiple levels of genetic and epigenetic transcription and post-transcriptional control, which ultimately determine which if any <italic>SICAvar</italic> genes are transcribed and which are translated. The <italic>SICAvar</italic> genes/transcripts/protein expression may in fact be in an &#x02018;off state&#x02019; prior to entering a vertebrate host, as shown to be the case in sporozoites for the <italic>var</italic> genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>], and the <italic>in vivo</italic> blood-stage environment including passage through the spleen (or factors therefrom) may provide the epigenetic stimuli needed to permit their coordinated/regulated expression. We speculate that in splenectomized animals, such predicted &#x02018;on signals&#x02019; are missing. In line with a recent report showing the activation of all <italic>var</italic> genes in the absence of the <italic>PfSETvs</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>], epigenetic control involving methylation of histones for silencing and demethylation for activation may likewise be paramount and should be investigated.</p><p>On a population level, a few important questions remain. It remains possible that individual parasite-infected RBCs are able to express a set of major and minor SICA proteins, or that the SICA[+] clonal populations being studied have undergone some degree of drift with the vast majority expressing the predominant proteins and a relative few expressing the minor proteins. Similarly, SICA[-] clones may represent a population of parasites that are all expressing a low level of transcripts that are not destined for translation, or a vast majority that are entirely in the off state and a relative few in the on state. These reflect some of the critical questions relating to <italic>SICAvar</italic> gene regulation and switching of variant phenotypes that can now be addressed in <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> by investigating epigenetic mechanisms and using quantitative imaging technologies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4.1"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All animal experiments in the current study were conducted in AAALAC-accredited facilities at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

Each primer set was validated in terms of PCR efficiency in order to accurately calculate relative quantification by the &#x00394;&#x00394;Ct method. cDNA was synthesized from 1 &#x000b5;g total RNA of each clone, ring and trophozoite stage, with Thermoscript enzyme (Invitrogen) and random hexamers at 57&#x000b0;C for 90 min, and cleaned through a Qiagen quick spin column. The PCR was carried out on a 384-well optical plate (Applied Biosystems) in a 10-&#x000b5;l reaction volume containing with TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), with primer concentrations of 50 pmol. All sequences were amplified using the Applied Biosystems 7900HT Sequence Detection System with the PCR profile: 50&#x000b0; for 2 min, 95&#x000b0;C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles at 95&#x000b0;C for 15 s, and 60&#x000b0;C for 1 min. Samples were tested in duplicate, in parallel with the housekeeping gene <italic>seryl tRNA synthetase</italic>. A pooled cDNA sample was used as an external control. Real-Time StatMiner<sup>TM</sup> software (Integromics, Inc., Madison, WI, USA) was used to perform a quality control for all runs and relative quantification &#x00394;&#x00394;Ct analysis to calculate the fold differences between samples.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0078014.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p><bold>Oligos for PCR, qRT-PCR, protein expression, and generation of riboprobes for Northern blot experiments.</bold>
