Several miRNA families target genes encoding nucleotide-binding site&#x02013;leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) plant innate immune receptors. The fungus <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>lycopersici</italic> causes vascular wilt disease in tomato. We explored a role for miRNAs in tomato defense against <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> using comparative miRNA profiling of susceptible (Moneymaker) and resistant (Motelle) tomato cultivars. slmiR482f and slmiR5300 were repressed during infection of Motelle with <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>. Two predicted mRNA targets each of slmiR482f and slmiR5300 exhibited increased expression in Motelle and the ability of these four targets to be regulated by the miRNAs was confirmed by co-expression in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>. Silencing of the targets in the resistant Motelle cultivar revealed a role in fungal resistance for all four genes. All four targets encode proteins with full or partial nucleotide-binding (NB) domains. One slmiR5300 target corresponds to <italic>tm-2</italic>, a susceptible allele of the <italic>Tomato Mosaic Virus</italic> resistance gene, supporting functions in immunity to a fungal pathogen. The observation that none of the targets correspond to <italic>I-2</italic>, the only known resistance (<italic>R</italic>) gene for <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> in tomato, supports roles for additional <italic>R</italic> genes in the immune response. Taken together, our findings suggest that Moneymaker is highly susceptible because its potential resistance is insufficiently expressed due to the action of miRNAs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p><italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> is a fungal pathogen that represents a species complex, with members that infect numerous crops. In spite of its importance to agriculture, very little is known about roles of small RNAs in plant immunity against <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>. In this study, we set up a screen for tomato microRNAs (miRNAs) that correlate with resistance to <italic>F. oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici</italic> by performing deep sequencing of small RNAs from a resistant and susceptible tomato cultivar. We focused on two miRNAs that are uniquely down-regulated in the resistant cultivar during fungal infection. All predicted targets of these miRNAs encode proteins with NB domains, a motif associated with pathogen resistance in plants. Using a heterologous system, we validated that the miRNAs could regulate expression of four targets. Silencing of the target genes in tomato resulted in decreased immunity to <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> in the normally resistant cultivar. The finding that none of our targets correspond to <italic>I-2</italic>, the only known resistance (<italic>R</italic>) gene for <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> in tomato, supports roles for additional <italic>R</italic> genes in the immune response.

The results with these two cultivars guided our experiments, allowing us to focus on miRNAs that were down-regulated in the resistant Motelle cultivar during infection. We were able to quickly narrow down to a small group of miRNAs and identify two (slmiR482f and slmiR5300) that correlated with disease. Knock-down of the target genes (Solyc08g075630 and Solyc08g076000 for slmiR482f and Solyc05g008650 and Solyc09g018220/<italic>tm-2</italic> for slmiR5300) caused the resistant Motelle cultivar to become susceptible to <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>. Our study provides a platform for differentially expressed miRNAs in tomato after <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> infection and demonstrates that plant miRNAs are involved in defense against <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>.</p><p>Due to extensive DNA sequence homology with another gene (Solyc02g014230), we were not able to produce a VIGS construct that was specific for the slmiR482f target Solyc08g076000. However, this construct resulted in susceptibility of the Motelle cultivar to <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> infection, and accumulation of fungal biomass comparable to that observed during knockdown of the other three miRNA target genes. Furthermore, qRT-PCR results demonstrated that Solyc08g076000 mRNA levels were greatly reduced, while Solyc02g014230 levels were relatively unchanged in the VIGS plants. Although we cannot rule out an effect on expression of Solyc02g014230 at an earlier time point that might affect plant defense, this finding supports an active role for Solyc08g076000, but not Solyc02g014230, in resistance to <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> in tomato.</p><p>Tomato is one of the most economically important crops and a model system for fruit development. Although whole-genome sequencing of domesticated tomato has made it possible to characterize the entire family of miRNAs, only a small number of miRNAs have been implicated in tomato-specific processes, such as fruit development and ripening <xref rid="ppat.1004464-Consortium1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004464-Pilcher1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004464-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. Our study showed that some disease resistance or abiotic stress-associated miRNAs, such as slmiR482f and slmiR398, are suppressed in the resistant tomato cultivar Motelle after <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> treatment. In addition we determined that slmiR5300, for which no functions had been previously ascribed <xref rid="ppat.1004464-Mohorianu1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004464-Karlova1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, was also suppressed in Motelle during <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> infection. SlmiR482 and slmiR5300 are members of the miR482/2118 superfamily and members of this family have been shown to target the p-loop motif in the mRNA of the NB-LRR encoding <italic>R</italic> genes <xref rid="ppat.1004464-Shivaprasad1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The miR482 family has six members, including miR482a-f <xref rid="ppat.1004464-Shivaprasad1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004464-Cuperus1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004464-Felippes1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004464-Meyers1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.</p><p>Plant defense responses can be activated very rapidly by pathogen infection. Studies in both plant and animal systems have demonstrated that some small RNAs are induced quickly and specifically by various pathogens and diseases <xref rid="ppat.1004464-Ferracin1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004464-KatiyarAgarwal1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004464-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. Interestingly, employing the psRNATarget algorithm, the top targets predicted for slmiR482f (Solyc08g075630 and Solyc08g076000) and slmiR5300 (Solyc05g008650 and Solyc09g018220) encode proteins with partial or full NB-domains. Surprisingly, Solyc09g018220 is allelic with the susceptible allele of the ToMV <italic>R</italic> gene <italic>tm-</italic>2. This finding implicates <italic>tm-2</italic> in resistance to fungal attack in tomato and suggests that susceptible disease resistance alleles could have roles in immunity. It is intriguing to speculate that plants are able to use susceptible disease resistance alleles to broaden the pathogen recognition spectrum. Since slmiR482f should also target both the functional <italic>Tm-2<sup>2</sup></italic> and broken <italic>Tm-2</italic> alleles, it is likely that these genes can also perform the role demonstrated here for <italic>tm-2</italic> in <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> resistance. The discovery of the need for additional full-length or truncated genes for a presumed single gene resistance has broad implication in breeding for resistance and transfer of these traits to plants from different families. It remains to be seen whether the interfamily barrier seen in the transfer of <italic>R</italic> genes is due to the absence of these additional genes <xref rid="ppat.1004464-Mukhtar1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>.</p><p>None of the four miRNAs target <italic>I-2</italic> and the three non-<italic>tm-2</italic> targets are not homologs of known R proteins in tomato or other plant species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004464.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). Surprisingly, silencing each of their respective genes resulted in susceptibility of Motelle tomato to <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>. Although silencing of Solyc09g018220/<italic>tm-2</italic> resulted in the most severe symptoms, the phenotypes of any single gene VIGS Motelle plant were not as drastic as those observed in the susceptible tomato cultivar Moneymaker lacking <italic>I-2</italic>. This could be because down-regulation of one NB-domain containing protein is not sufficient to completely abolish effective disease resistance in tomato. Alternatively, the residual transcript levels of target genes in VIGS plants may have produced this outcome. Taken together, these results support the requirement for multiple proteins carrying the NB domain, including <italic>tm-2</italic>, in resistance of tomato to <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>.</p><p>There are other studies where inadequate expression of resistance to a eukaryotic plant pathogen occurs because resistance genes are suppressed or underexpressed in solanaceous plant species.

<xref rid="ppat.1004464-Tai1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>.

The resistance is encoded by a yet unidentified QTL locus. The results showed that VIGS of an <italic>R</italic> gene that was upregulated in the resistant (but not susceptible) line after pathogen infection led to reduced resistance in the normally resistant line. The mode of regulation of the transcripts in these studies was not reported, but the possibility remains that some of the affected mRNAs are down-regulated by miRNAs.</p><p>Recently, several examples have been described for the requirement of a pair of NB-LRR proteins for the recognition of a specific Avr and disease resistance in a number of plant species, including Arabidopsis, <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, rice and wheat <xref rid="ppat.1004464-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004464-Loutre1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004464-Narusaka1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004464-Okuyama1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004464-Peart1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004464-Sinapidou1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>.

It remains to be determined whether introduction of artificial miRNAs that silence mature and or precursor forms of slmiR482f and slmiR5300 could up-regulate target gene expression in the susceptible Moneymaker plants.
