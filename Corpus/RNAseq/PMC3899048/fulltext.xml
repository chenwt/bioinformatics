To evaluate the potential of miR-137 in glioblastoma therapy, we conducted genome-wide target mapping in glioblastoma cells by measuring the level of association between PABP and mRNAs in cells transfected with miR-137 mimics vs. controls via RIPSeq. Impact on mRNA levels was also measured by RNASeq. By combining the results of both experimental approaches, 1468 genes were found to be negatively impacted by miR-137 &#x02013; among them, 595 (40%) contain miR-137 predicted sites. The most relevant targets include oncogenic proteins and key players in neurogenesis like c-KIT, YBX1, AKT2, CDC42, CDK6 and TGF&#x003b2;2. Interestingly, we observed that several identified miR-137 targets are also predicted to be regulated by miR-124, miR-128 and miR-7, which are equally implicated in neuronal differentiation and gliomagenesis. We suggest that the concomitant increase of these four miRNAs in neuronal stem cells or their repression in tumor cells could produce a robust regulatory effect with major consequences to neuronal differentiation and tumorigenesis.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health [HG006015 to A.D.S. and L.O.F.P.], IIMS and CTSA (UTHSCSA) [to L.O.F.P.], Center for Biomedical Neuroscience (CBN) (UTHSCSA) [to L.O.F.P.], and the Max and Minnie Tomerlin Voelcker Fund [to L.O.F.P.].

In the context of glioblastomas, miRNA signatures were used to re-classify tumors and assess prognosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085591-Kim1">[1]</xref> and to build networks to define novel oncogenic pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085591-Sumazin1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085591-Setty1">[3]</xref>. A small group of miRNAs that includes miR-7, miR-124, miR-128 and miR-137 has been shown by numerous studies to be present at the interesting intersection between neurogenesis and brain tumor development. More specifically, an increase in their expression seems to be required for neuronal differentiation while their down regulation is frequently observed in gliomas and associated with disease progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085591-GonzalezGomez1">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085591-Silber1">[6]</xref>.

In addition, miR-137 expression was found to be significantly down-regulated in a cohort of 35 oligodendroglial tumors compared with normal brains. Lower miR-137 expression was associated with both shorter progression-free and overall survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085591-Li1">[12]</xref>. Transfection of miR-137 mimics in glioma cells decreased proliferation, invasion and anchorage-independent-growth, produced cell cycle arrest in G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> phase and affected their growth as xenografts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085591-Silber1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085591-Chen1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085591-Li1">[12]</xref>.

Similar to what has been observed in glioblastoma cells, restoration of miR-137 reduced cell proliferation of colon cancer lines HCT116 and RKO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085591-Balaguer1">[14]</xref>. Regulation of miR-137 expression via promoter hypermethylation is perhaps a common mechanism as it was also established in oral cancer, gastric cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085591-Kozaki1">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085591-Langevin2">[18]</xref>. Uveal melanoma is another tumor type affected by miR-137 where its expression is lower in uveal melanoma cell lines when compared to uveal melanocytes. Ectopic expression of miR-137 in melanoma cells induced G<sub>1</sub> cell cycle arrest and a decrease in cell growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085591-Chen3">[19]</xref>. A connection between miR-137 and breast cancer has been suggested based on its regulation of orphan nuclear receptor ERR&#x003b1;, a prognostic factor of poor clinical outcome.

Clearly, miR-137 is an important player in a diverse set of cancer systems and further understanding of its mechanism of action and its mRNA targets are warranted.</p><p>Several miR-137 targets have been identified in the context of the neuronal system including lysine-specific demethylase (LSD1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085591-Sun1">[10]</xref>, RTVP-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085591-Bier1">[13]</xref>, KDM1A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085591-Althoff1">[22]</xref>, Mind Bomb-1 (Mib1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085591-Smrt1">[7]</xref>, COX-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085591-Chen1">[11]</xref>, the histone methyltransferase Ezh2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085591-Szulwach1">[23]</xref>, the cell cycle regulator CDK6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085591-Silber1">[6]</xref>, the oncogenic RNA binding protein Musashi1 (Msi1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085591-Vo1">[9]</xref>, CSE1 chromosome segregation 1-like (CSE1L) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085591-Li1">[12]</xref> and Jarid1b, a histone H3 Lys4 demethylase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085591-Tarantino1">[8]</xref>. However, determining the genome-wide impact miR-137 transfection would have on glioblastoma cells is a mandatory step to establish its potential as a therapeutic agent. We have conducted genomic analyses in glioblastoma cells including the usage of a novel approach inspired by the recently described mechanism of miRNA action via PABP (poly A binding protein) and the poly A tail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085591-Moretti1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085591-Fabian1">[25]</xref>. Our results led to the identification of 595 targets of miR-137, comprising important oncogenic proteins such as c-KIT, AKT2, YBX1, CD24, CDC42 and TGF&#x003b2;2. We also determined that miR-137 potentially shares a large portion of its targets with miR-7, miR-124 and miR-128, indicating that their absence as a group in neuronal cells could constitute an important contribution to gliomagenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell growth and transfection</title><p>U251 and U343 glioblastoma cells (ATCC) were grown in DMEM medium with 10% FBS.

To identify transcripts that are significantly down-regulated upon transfection of the miR-137 mimic, we constructed a two-by-two contingency table counting the number of reads (1) mapped to the transcript in the control, (2) mapped to other transcripts in the control, (3) mapped to the transcript in the miR-137 transfection and (4) mapped to other transcripts in the miR-137 transfection. We then applied Fisher's exact test to each of these tables (21,698 tables in total). We correct the resultant <italic>p</italic>-values for multiple hypothesis testing using the method of Benjamini and Hochberg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085591-Benjamini1">[29]</xref>, and retain each transcript that has an odds ratio of greater than 2&#x000d7; down-regulation with a corrected <italic>p</italic>-value smaller than 0.001.

Two distinct genomic approaches were used to map the effect of miR-137 in glioblastoma cells. First, RNASeq was employed to determine changes at the mRNA level triggered by transfection of miR-137 mimics. In a second approach, we used RIPSeq to identify which mRNA species change their level of association with Poly A binding protein (PABP) upon miR-137 transfection. More specifically, mRNAs associated with PABP were immuno-precipitated and the differences in the profile of control vs. miR-137 transfected cells were assessed by next-generation sequencing &#x02013; <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0085591.s002">Figure S1</xref></bold>. The idea behind this strategy is that PABP displays key functions in miRNA activity as recently described by Moretti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085591-Moretti1">[24]</xref>, and therefore, can act as a reporter of miRNA targeting. According to this model, mRISC ultimately disrupts the PABP-polyA interaction in target mRNAs. We expected miR-137 to disrupt the interaction between PABP and its target mRNAs, decreasing the levels of immuno-precipitated mRNAs; the read-out would be a reduction in the number of sequence reads for the target mRNAs.</p><p>The two approaches combined identified in U251 cells a total of 647 mRNAs down-regulated by transfection of miR-137 mimics; 95 mRNAs were identified by both RIPSeq and RNASeq methods &#x02013; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085591-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>. Decreased mRNA binding to PABP, which is identified using RIPSeq, indicates regulation by miR-137, as compared to the control transfection. In RNASeq analysis, miR-137 affected genes were identified by the decrease in the number of reads for transcripts upon miR-137 transfection. For those targets that were identified in only one set, we compared the differences in fold change. We observed that close to half such targets show more than an average 1&#x000d7; greater decrease in the approach where it was identified over that where it was not &#x02013; for example, a target identified in the RNASeq method with an average fold-change of 2&#x000d7; down compared to an average of 1&#x000d7; (i.e. no change) in the RIPSeq method would represent a 1&#x000d7; difference.

In the current study, we also used a dual strategy to evaluate the impact of miR-137 in glioblastoma cells. The novelty was the usage of PABP as a reporter of miRNA activity. This concept is in line with recent results from Mathias Hentze's group that show PABP as a central player in miRNA function. In their model, PABP has a dual role: PABP and the poly A tail enhance binding of miRISC to the target mRNA during early stages of silencing, then PABP is later displaced by miRISC, allowing recruitment of deadenylase complexes and subsequent deadenylation of target mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085591-Moretti1">[24]</xref>.

The regulation of Msi1 by miR-137 is highly conserved as the target site is not only present in multiple vertebrates but also in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologues Musashi and RBP6. Msi1 and miR-137 have apparently antagonistic roles and opposite expression patterns in neurogenesis and brain tumor formation. Msi1 is a stem cell related RNA binding protein implicated in stem cell self-renewal and development of both medulloblastoma and glioblastoma. A decrease in Msi1 expression is required for neuronal differentiation while its high expression is frequently associated with tumors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085591-Glazer1">[72]</xref>). Recent CLIP analysis done in our lab to identify Msi1 targets in U251 cells demonstrated that the association between these two regulators goes beyond the direct regulation of Msi1 by miR-137. Msi1 and miR-137 share 83 targets (p&#x0003c;1.87&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;10</sup>; Fisher's exact test) and might regulate their expression in opposite directions. Moreover, when assembled together, Msi1 and miR-137 identified targets produced a complex gene network.

The prediction of miRNA-miRNA synergistic networks based on common targets of corresponding miRNA pairs, enriched in the same gene ontology category and close proximity in protein interaction network showed that an extensive cross-talk takes place among different miRNA species. Interestingly, miRNAs associated with the same disease are close to each other in projected networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085591-Xu1">[74]</xref>. Our data is in agreement with this idea and suggests that miR-137 potentially shares the same group of mRNA targets with miR-7, -124 and -128 to drive cells towards neurogenesis and while absent, these miRNAs can produce a strong oncogenic response that could contribute to gliomagenesis.</p><p>Much of the great interest in miRNAs is related to their potential use in cancer therapy. The broad impact on gliomagenesis revealed by our study suggests that miR-137 mimics could become a viable alternative to treat brain tumor patients. As stated earlier, miR-137 expression is lost, putatively during gliomagenesis suggesting that it acts as a tumor suppressor, acting by repressing the expression of oncogenes such as those identified in this paper. Replenishment of miR-137 provides an opportunity to broadly repress these oncogenes and cancer-relevant genes.
