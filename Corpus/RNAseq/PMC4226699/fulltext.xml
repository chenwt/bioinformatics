In this study, we explored the prognostic value of spinophilin expression in 162 colon adenocarcinoma patients. In addition, we generated stably expressing spinophilin-directed shRNA CRC cell lines and studied the influence of spinophilin expression on cellular phenotypes and molecular interactions. We independently confirmed that low spinophilin expression levels are associated with poor prognosis in CRC patients (<italic>p</italic> = 0.038). A reduction of spinophilin levels in <italic>p53</italic> wild-type HCT116 and <italic>p53</italic>-mutated Caco-2 cells led to increased cellular growth rates and anchorage-independent growth (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). At molecular level, reduced spinophilin levels increased the expression of the transcription factor E2F-1. In addition, we observed an increased formation of tumor spheres, increased number of CD133 positive cells and an increased resistance to 5-flourouracil (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Finally, treatment with the de-methylating agent 5-aza-dC increased spinophilin expression in CRC cells (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), corroborated by a correlation of spinophilin expression and extent of methylated CpG sites in the gene promoter region (p&#x0003c;0.001). In conclusion, gain of aggressive biological properties of CRC cells including cellular growth, cancer stem cell features and 5-flourouracil resistance partly explains the role of spinophilin in CRC.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>prognosis</kwd><kwd>cellular growth</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Despite a decrease of incidence and mortality in the last years, colorectal cancer (CRC) still remains the most common cancer of the digestive system, associated with high morbidity and mortality rates according to the American Cancer Society in 2014 [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Depending on the clinical stage at diagnosis, different treatment approaches including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are the mainstay of the therapeutic armamentarium [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The introduction of novel targeted agents in CRC treatment within the last 10 years improved the survival, though metastatic CRC represents an incurable disease in most cases. Hence, there is a real need for the discovery of novel prognostic and pathogenesis-driving factors to improve clinical outcome of these patients [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Spinophilin (also known as PPP1R9B and neurabin II) is a multifunctional scaffold protein located at chromosome 17q21.33. This chromosomal region is frequently associated with microsatellite instability and loss of heterozygosity (LOH), features frequently associated in the pathogenesis of CRC [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Previous studies also reported that low levels of spinophilin expression in tumors are associated with cancer progression and poor prognosis in lung, kidney, head and neck cancer, and leukemia [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Ferrer and colleagues demonstrated in mouse embryonic fibroblasts that the loss of spinophilin contributes to high levels of phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRb) with the consequence of increased activation of the tumor suppressor <italic>p53</italic>. In the absence of <italic>p53</italic> or impaired function by mutation, the cells develop a pro-proliferative phenotype, given that the elevated pRb, which is normally neutralized by <italic>p53</italic>, drives a pro-proliferative state [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, in two recently published studies of hepatocellular carcinoma and CRC, loss of spinophilin was associated with <italic>p53-</italic>independent cellular proliferation [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In the first previously published study of spinophilin in CRC, Estevez-Garcia <italic>et al.</italic> recently described a correlation of spinophilin expression and advanced tumor stages. Furthermore, low spinophilin expression was associated with a more aggressive histologic phenotype, faster relapse and poorer survival in their study [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, an external validation of these findings is still missing and the possible underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms in CRC are poorly explored. Importantly, the external validation of such newly identified prognostic risk factors in independent cohorts of patients is paramount prior to the generalization of the applicability of a prognostic marker and some studies fail to replicate the findings of others [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, we validated the influence of spinophilin expression on survival in CRC on a large independent cohort of patients. Based on the positive clinical data, we further studied the potential cellular functions and molecular mechanisms of alterations in spinophilin expression in CRC.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><p>First of all, we measured spinophilin expression in eleven different CRC cell lines. Overall, in seven out of eleven CRC cell lines spinophilin was expressed at a lower level compared to normal colon (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). This lower expression in CRC cell lines prompted us to expand our analysis on <italic>in vivo</italic> data of CRC patients. For evaluation of the prognostic relevance of spinophilin expression in an external data set, we analyzed mRNA expression data from the TCGA dataset. In 162 available colon adenocarcinoma patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), we found that a lower expression of spinophilin is associated with poor patient survival (<italic>p</italic> = 0.038, Kaplan Meier curve Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). In our study cohort, low spinophilin expression levels did not significantly correlate with patient age, gender, location, clinical stage, primary tumor stage, distant metastases or microsatellite status (all <italic>p</italic>-values &#x0003e;0.05, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Univariate analysis identified advanced clinical stage (stage I+II versus III+IV) and low expression spinophilin expression as poor prognostic factors for overall survival (all <italic>p</italic>-values &#x0003c;0.05), whereas age, gender, location of the tumor and microsatellite status were not significantly associated with survival (data not shown). To test whether the prognostic value of low spinophilin expression is independent of other risk factors of poor survival, a multivariate analysis was performed using a Cox proportional hazard model. Multivariate analysis including all factors significant in univariate analysis (clinical stage and level of spinophilin expression) confirmed low spinophilin expression as an independent predictor for poor survival in CRC patients (hazard ratio = 3.02, 95% confidence interval =1.04-8.79, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.042). For a more detailed characterization of the possible biological impact of low spinophilin levels in CRC cells, we generated stably spinophilin-silenced CRC cell lines. For this purpose, we selected the spinophilin high expressing HCT116 and the spinophilin low expressing Caco-2 cell line (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). These two cell lines are also different with regard to their <italic>p53</italic> mutational status (HCT116: <italic>p53</italic> wild-type and Caco-2: <italic>p53</italic> mutated, respectively). Generating stably expressing spinophilin-directed shRNA cells, a relative reduction to about 60% expression levels could be detected (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Consecutively, we explored the growth behavior of the spinophilin-silenced cells using the WST-1 proliferation assay. In the <italic>p53</italic> wild-type HCT-116 cell line we observed a statistically significant increase of cellular growth in spinophilin-silenced cells over a 72 hours observational period (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). To substantiate these findings with a second independent method, we monitored cellular growth rates by using the xCELLigence system. This real-time growth assay continuously detects the well impedance as a measure of cell density. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> cellular growth (indicated by the cell index on the Y-axis) increases in cells with reduced spinophilin expression compared to the control cells. We further characterized the influence of spinophilin expression levels on well-established features of cancer stem cells. Anchorage-independent growth was assessed by soft agar colony formation assay. A significantly higher number of colonies in spinophilin-silenced cells compared to control cells in HCT-116 cells could be observed (<italic>p</italic> = 0.012, Wilcoxon test, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). To investigate whether differences of apoptotic activity are responsible for the differently observed growth rates and colony formation, we performed an annexin staining using a flow cytometer. The shRNA scrambled-control cell line showed no increased proportion of this apoptosis-related marker (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3A, B</xref>). In addition, we measured the full length and cleaved PARP protein expression by Western Blot (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S3C</xref>), the gene expression of the pro-apoptotic <italic>Bax</italic> gene and the anti-apoptotic <italic>Bcl-2</italic> gene, and the EMT-related markers E-cadherin and vimentin, but could not detect any significant differences (data not shown). To explore possible molecular down-stream effects of spinophilin-silencing, we observed higher levels of E2F-1, a well-known driving factor for cellular growth (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Using a second cell line, the <italic>p53</italic>-mutated Caco-2 cell line, we independently confirmed that lower spinophilin expression levels are associated with increased cellular growth rates and increased E2F-1 protein expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A and 3B</xref>). For phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein we received rather inconsistent findings with regard to activation of this protein (data not shown). To further clarify whether <italic>p53</italic> mutation status influence the behavior of CRC with varying levels of spinophilin expression, we added a survival analysis in the 162 TCGA dataset patients by stratifying them into four groups according to <italic>p53</italic>-mutational status and spinophilin expression (details see also in the Material and Methods section). However, we could not detect any influence of <italic>p53</italic> mutations when added to the spinophilin expression levels on a better separation of survival curves (data not shown). Next, we investigated the effect of spinophilin-silencing on self-renewal capacity using tumor sphere assays and analyzed the expression of the CD133 surface marker and proportion of the side population by FACS. As the HCT116 cell line did not generate tumor spheres in sufficient numbers to count and did not show any side population in FACS analysis, we performed this step with Caco-2 cells only. The number and size of primary (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>) and secondary (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>) tumor spheres were significantly higher in spinophilin-silenced cells (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c;0.05). We also observed a numerically increase of CD133 positive cells in the whole cell population (14.97% versus 8.23%) as well as in the sorted side population for spinophilin-silenced cells (3.27% versus 2.17%, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Detailed scatterplot images of the different subpopulations are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A-F</xref>. Consequently, exposing these cells to different concentrations of 5-FU for 48 hours, we observed a higher resistance to 5-FU in the spinophilin-silenced cells. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> shows the dose-response curves and corresponding IC50 values. In order to evaluate some molecular causes for the different spinophilin expression levels in tumor tissue, we analyzed the TCGA dataset with regard to copy number changes in the spinophilin gene region. For this purpose, we downloaded copy number information from the cBioportal for cancer genomics as well as copy number data as generated by the GISTIC algorithm. This algorithm attempts to identify significantly altered regions of amplification or deletion across sets of patients. It generates putative gene/patient copy number specific calls: &#x0201c;-2&#x0201d; is a deep loss, possibly a homozygous deletion, &#x0201c;-1&#x0201d; is a single-copy loss (heterozygous deletion), &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; is diploid, &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; indicates a low-level gain, and &#x0201c;2&#x0201d; is a high-level amplification. Of the 155 patients with all available data in our cohort (copy number changes and expression values), 22 (14.2%) had &#x0201c;-1&#x0201d; (i.e. single-copy loss) and 28 (18.1%) had &#x0201c;+1&#x0201d; (i.e. low-level gain). Interestingly, we could see a direct correlation with regard to spinophilin expression/copy numbers in tumor samples (R = 0.38, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Spinophilin expression and influence on survival and cellular growth</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> In 162 available patients of The Cancer Genome Atlas data set, a low spinophilin expression is associated with poor survival. <bold>(B)</bold> Silencing of spinophilin by shRNA in HCT116 cells leads to increased cellular growth rate in the WST-1 assay (0 to 72 hours, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="oncotarget-05-8492-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Cellular growth, anchorage-independent growth and molecular alterations</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> In the xCELLigence system, increase in the cellular growth is observed in HCT116 shRNA spinophilin (red, upper line) compared to HCT116 shRNA scrambled control (green, lower line) cells <bold>(B)</bold> Colony numbers in soft agar plates are significantly increased in the spinophilin-silenced HCT116 cells.

After treatment with these agents a significant up-regulation of spinophilin in these cell lines at a varying extent (up to 4 fold) was observed after 15&#x003bc;M 5-aza-dC or combined TSA treatment but not after TSA only treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). To explore the role of different levels of CpG methylation in the promoter region of spinophilin <italic>in vivo</italic>, we utilized bioinformatic tools to retrieve data for 19 CpGs sites in a CpG island in the promoter region of the spinophilin gene (Position: chr17:48226224-48228625, Band: 17q21.33, Genomic Size: 2402 bp, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S5A</xref>). We used data generated by an Illumina Infinium Methylation450 platform derived from the TCGA data set. We obtained methylation data of 31 patients out of the 162 in our cohort. In these patients, we found for at least two CpGs in this region a significantly negative correlation between spinophilin expression and DNA methylation extent (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure S5B-C</xref>).</p><fig id="F6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Spinophilin expression after de-methylation with 5-aza-dC</title><p>Four different cell lines, (A) HCT-116, (B) RKO, (C) Colo320 and (D) Colo201 cells showed an increase in spinophilin expression after 96 hours of treatment with 5-aza-dC or even enhanced by the histon-deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A.

This initiative has led to the discovery of some key molecules and pathways including the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in tumor angiogenesis and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with the therapy guiding <italic>KRAS/NRAS</italic> mutations. These and other molecules highly impacted the clinical practice of CRC treatment [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Nevertheless, due to the moderate survival rates of metastatic CRC, the race for identifying novel factors, whether useful as drug targets, prognostic markers or diagnostics, is still ongoing [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In this study, we report about the role of spinophilin, a previously recognized novel tumor suppressor gene, in CRC. First, we found using the internationally established TCGA dataset that low spinophilin levels are associated with poor survival in uni- as well as multivariate analyses. These findings match well with the previous report about spinophilin in CRC, where Estevez-Garcia and colleagues proposed a negative influence on survival and relapse-free time especially in stage III CRC patients treated with adjuvant fluoropyrimidine therapy [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In this well-designed study, the authors also report about lower response rates to therapy in patients with low spinophilin expression. In addition, using CRC cell lines (Colo205, HT29, SW480) with different <italic>p53</italic> mutational status (wild-type or mutated), which were different from the ones we used in our study, they also observed an increased growth in spinophilin-silenced cells in soft agar assays. A clinical or experimental observation holds true and gets substantiated when independent models and groups confirm the results [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, the findings in our study confirm that low spinophilin expression is associated with poor survival and, by using different cellular growth assays and cell lines, a loss of this protein drives cellular growth in CRC independent of the p53 mutational status. In our study, we further demonstrated that reduction of spinophilin leads to an increase of the transcription factor E2F-1. This mechanism of action seems to be similar as previously reported by Ferrer <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The higher proliferative state of tumors with low spinophilin expression might be one explanation for the poor clinical outcome in this group of patients. However, in a further attempt to characterize the cellular mode of action, we also identified that spinophilin-silenced cells are prone to form more tumor spheres under ultra-low attachment conditions than control cells. Furthermore, a higher number of CD133 positive cells in the whole population as well as in the side population could be identified. Both of these features, tumor sphere formation and CD133 positive cells/side population have been previously described as cancer stem cell features in CRC [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In our study, we also found a significant correlation between copy number changes and the levels of spinophilin expression. Estevez-Garcia and colleagues hypothesized in their study that spinophilin might increase the resistance to chemotherapeutic agents [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In line with this notion, we detected higher growth rates of 5-FU treated cells in the spinophilin-silenced cells, which support this hypothesis. Interestingly, we also observed an up-regulation of spinophilin in CRC cells after treatment of the DNA-demethylation agent 5-aza-dC. Estevez-Garcia <italic>et al</italic>. detected no DNA methylation in the promoter region of spinophilin gene. However, they used methylation-specific PCR, which only covers a limited number of CpG sites and is a rather qualitative method for DNA-methylation detection. In our study, we used genome-wide methylation data and found for at least two CpG sites a negative correlation between extent of methylation and spinophilin expression. According to our data, either the region of the promoter or some other enhancer regions of the spinophilin gene are affected by DNA methylation, which in turn can influence the expression level of this tumor suppressor in tumors. Another explanation for our observation might be an indirect effect of other trans-acting transcription factors that are activated by the DNA-demethylating agent and thus increase the transcription of the spinophilin locus. Clinically, this relationship of low spinophilin levels and aggressive behavior may be circumvented by restoration of spinophilin expression or, even easier to perform, the inhibition of down-stream affected factors like E2F-1 [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, further research to decipher additional modes of action and pre-clinical trials are necessary before the true value of spinophilin-targeting in clinical practice can be estimated.</p><p>In summary, we confirmed the previously identified association of low spinophilin expression and poor prognosis in CRC patients. In addition, we found that spinophilin might be involved in cancer stem cells, that the E2F-1 signaling is positively influenced and that DNA methylation in CRC cells might explain in part the differential expression of spinophilin in CRC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Patient cohort</title><p>For validation of spinophilin expression and its prognostic relevance in CRC tissue, we made use and analyzed data publicly available from the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/">http://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/</ext-link>) for CRC patients [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

For 151 patients among them, we obtained <italic>p53</italic> somatic mutation information from same study [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Analyses were carried out in R statistical environment (version 3.0.1) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http:///www.r-project.org/">http:///www.r-project.org/</ext-link>). All tests were two-sided and considered statistical significant at the 0.05 level. For prognostic studies, we checked for a relationship between spinophilin mRNA expression and overall survival as follows: Patients were grouped into percentiles according to mRNA expression. The log-rank test was employed to determine the association between mRNA expression and overall survival. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to generate overall survival curves. The cut-off to optimally separate the patients into low/high groups (log-rank test p-value minimum) was chosen. The cut-off value to optimally separate the patients in this cohort was determined at 0.34 (where 1 means 100% of the cohort). Based on the previous description that a loss of spinophilin led to tumor progression especially in a <italic>p53</italic>-mutated genotype [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], we considered whether adding <italic>p53</italic> mutation status added information to the prognostic value. For this purpose, we did this by letting the spinophilin cut-off level to vary between 0.25 and 0.75 and recording for each patient <italic>p53</italic> mutation status. This splits the cohort in four groups corresponding to low/high spinophilin expression and mutated/wild-type <italic>p53</italic> status. The log-rank test was again employed to determine the association between spinophilin mRNA expression/<italic>p53</italic> status and overall survival.</p><p>For testing the CpG methylation status of CpGs in a CpG island in the promoter region of the spinophilin gene (position: chr17:48226224-48228625, Band: 17q21.33, Genomic Size: 2402 bp) we used data generated by an Illumina platform (Infinium Methylation450 platform) derived from the TCGA data set. We obtained methylation data of 31 patients out of the 162 in our cohort for 19 CpG sites. The reason for the limited number of patients was that methylation profiling in the TCGA dataset was performed for some patients on an Infinium Methylation27 platform and for some patients ( n = 31) on an Infinium Methylation450 platform. Unfortunately, the Infinium Methylation27 package does not have a comprehensive coverage as the Infinium Methylation450 and the spinophilin promoter region was not targeted on the Infinium Methylation 27 platform. For quantifying the methylation levels, the analysis resulted in beta-values. A beta-value is generated by Illumina&#x02032;s technology. Beta values for each interrogated CpG locus are calculated as Beta = M/(M+U)+100, whereby M and U represent the mean signal intensities for replicate methylated (M) and unmethylated (U) probes on the array. Beta can take a value between 0 (no methylation) and 1 (highest degree of methylation).</p></sec><sec id="s4_2"><title>Cell culture</title><p>The human CRC cell lines Caco-2 and HCT-116, which are extensively used in this study, were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, CA, USA) and their origin was proven by DNA identity STR-analysis. Caco-2 cells were grown in MEM with Earle's Salts and L-Glutamine. For HCT-116 McCoy's 5A modified Medium (w/o L-Glutamine, 2,2g/L sodium bicarbonate) was used.

In more detail, after standard trypsinization 2x10<sup>4</sup> HCT-116 cells (shRNA spinophilin and shRNA scrambled control) per well were seeded in a 96-well culture plate. The cells were incubated in normal McCoy`s 5A modified Medium growth medium (Biochrom, Berlin Germany) for 48 hours and the WST-1 proliferation reagent (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim Germany) was applied according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After four hours the colorimetric changes were measured using a SpectraMax Plus (Molecular Devices, CA, US) at a wavelength of 450 nm with a reference wavelength at 620 nm. Three independent experiments in six technical replicates were performed. The same assay was used for testing the resistance of Caco2 cells to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). In detail, 24 hours after seeding the spinophilin-silenced and control cells to wells of a 96-well plate, eight different two-fold diluted concentrations of 5-FU including one untreated control were added to the cells (in the range of physiological levels between 0.625 to 40 &#x003bc;M).

Hoechst 33342 dye was excited by a 350-nm ultraviolet laser, and fluorescence emission was dual wavelength analyzed (Hoechst blue 440/40; Hoechst Red 695/40). In general, cells in a side population have distinguishing biological characteristics, commonly indicated by the ability to efflux chemotherapy drugs or other marker molecules (Hoechst 33342).
