In non-vascular and vascular land plants, convergent morphology in the form of roots, stems, and leaves arose. The morphology of some green algae includes an anchoring holdfast, stipe, and leaf-like fronds. Such morphology occurs in the absence of multicellularity in the siphonous algae, which are single cells. Morphogenesis is separate from cellular division in the land plants, which although are multicellular, have been argued to exhibit properties similar to single celled organisms. Within the single, macroscopic cell of a siphonous alga, how are transcripts partitioned, and what can this tell us about the development of similar convergent structures in land plants? Here, we present a <italic>de novo</italic> assembled, intracellular transcriptomic atlas for the giant coenocyte <italic>Caulerpa taxifolia</italic>. Transcripts show a global, basal-apical pattern of distribution from the holdfast to the frond apex in which transcript identities roughly follow the flow of genetic information in the cell, transcription-to-translation. The analysis of the intersection of transcriptomic atlases of a land plant and <italic>Caulerpa</italic> suggests the recurrent recruitment of transcript accumulation patterns to organs over large evolutionary distances. Our results not only provide an intracellular atlas of transcript localization, but also demonstrate the contribution of transcript partitioning to morphology, independent from multicellularity, in plants.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Plants include both the green algae and land plants. Multiple times, root, stem, and leaf-like structures arose independently in plant lineages. In some instances, such as the siphonous algae, these structures arose in the absence of multicellularity. It has been argued by some that the morphology of multicellular land plant organs similarly arises independently of cell division patterns. Here, we explore the partitioning of gene transcripts within what is debatably the largest single-celled organism in the world, the siphonous alga <italic>Caulerpa taxifolia</italic>. We find that within this giant cell specific transcripts localize within pseudo-organs (morphological structures that are not comprised of cells or tissue). The overall pattern of transcript accumulation follows an apical-basal pattern within the cell. Moreover, transcripts related to different cellular processes, such as transcription and translation, localize to specific regions. Analyzing the signatures of transcript accumulation in land plant organs and the pseudo-organs of <italic>Caulerpa</italic>, we find that groups of transcripts accumulate together in morphological structures across evolution at rates higher than expected by chance. Together, our results demonstrate a relationship between transcript partitioning and organism morphology, independent from multicellularity, throughout diverse plant lineages.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work is supported through a National Science Foundation grant (IOS-0820854) to NRS and a Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation Life Sciences Research Fellowship to DHC.

Siphonocladous chlorophytes have a chambered body plan compartmentalizing variable numbers of nuclei, as in <italic>Cladophora</italic>. Land plants (Embryophyta) are multicellular organisms, in which organs are composed of tissues and distinct cell types.

In its place, Kaplan and Hagemann <xref rid="pgen.1004900-Kaplan1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> argued for organismal theory, which they define as &#x0201c;[interpreting] the living protoplasmic mass as a whole, rather than considering its constituent cells as the basic unit.&#x0201d; In other words, the morphology in plants arises at the organismal level rather than as an emergent cellular property. Kaplan and Hagemann assert that &#x0201c;higher plants are also siphonous, but at a subtler, microscopic level.&#x0201d; Some of the siphonous features they argue land plants possess include: 1) cell division through a phragmoplast, 2) plasmodesmata, 3) the symplasm, 4) a multinucleate endosperm and megagametophytes, 5) distinct cytohistological zonations of the shoot apical meristem throughout the Embryophyta, 6) that cell lineage is often independent of morphology (e.g., in leaves), 7) and convergent morphology in multicellular red algae and land plants with different cell lineage patterns.</p><p>That land plants are truly siphonous is false: cell walls are a prominent features of land plants upon which morphology is dependent and land plants are multicellular organisms. However, it is useful to think about development in land plants from this unique perspective. That organ growth and morphogenesis are separate from cell division reduces the importance of cell-type specific transcript accumulation in these organisms. Transcriptomics and phylogenetics provide a mechanism to test hypotheses of cell versus organismal theory in siphonous green algae and land plants. Do the accumulation patterns of transcripts differ between single-celled and multicellular organisms with convergent morphology? Are groups of transcripts recurrently recruited to organs across large evolutionary distances regardless of whether an organism is multicellular?</p><p>Here, we provide a transcriptome of the giant coenocyte <italic>Caulerpa taxifolia</italic>.

Cell compartmentalization is partitioned in <italic>Caulerpa</italic>, despite its polynucleate condition, and transcripts are patterned according to the flow of genetic information, from transcription-to-translation in a basal-to-apical fashion. An analysis of the intersection of the transcriptomic atlases of a land plant (tomato, <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>) and <italic>Caulerpa</italic> demonstrates a limited, recurrent recruitment of genes with similar functions to morphological structures.

Due to read mapping ambiguity among <italic>de novo</italic> assembled transcripts, it is common to have the same read mapped to multiple contigs.

Four main densities in the variance attributable to accumulation patterns were discernable (arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004900-g002">
<bold>Fig. 2A</bold>
</xref>), and the results of a 4 cluster SOM largely overlap with the densities. Variance in accumulation among transcripts across organs was large, however, and the decision to specify 6 SOM clusters not only produced clusters with unique accumulation patterns and lower variance in abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004900-g002">
<bold>Fig. 2C</bold>
</xref>), but also yielded clusters with more interpretable GO enrichment categories (that is, significant GO enrichment consistent with known biology, such as photosynthetic GOs enriched in nodes with high pinnule transcript abundance). To verify that 6 GOs was indeed the maximum cluster number specifying unique transcript accumulation profiles without redundancy, we undertook partitioning of the PCA space into a variable number of SOM clusters over 100 iterations for each node number with random seeds. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was performed on genes maximizing separation of cluster identity using PCs 1&#x02013;5 (PC6 explained negligible amounts of variance and could not be incorporated into the LDA) using the lda function from the MASS package <xref rid="pgen.1004900-Venables1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The predict function (stats package) and table function (base package) were used to reallocate genes to predicted clusters (within MASS) using the linear discriminants. A high fraction of a node's originally assigned transcripts by SOM being reassigned correctly indicates little redundancy in node transcript accumulation patterns. Starting with 6 nodes, reassignment using LDA begins to drop before reaching a plateau of low reassignment rates, indicating that choosing 6 nodes maximizes the number of unique accumulation profiles represented by clusters without redundancy (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004900.s001">S1 Fig.</xref></bold> for results).</p><p>Analysis of intersection between tomato and <italic>Caulerpa</italic> transcriptomic atlases was undertaken using data from Chitwood et al. <xref rid="pgen.1004900-Chitwood1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.
