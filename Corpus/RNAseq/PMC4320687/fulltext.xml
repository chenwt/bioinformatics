id="P3">Immune responses are tightly regulated to ensure efficient pathogen clearance while avoiding tissue damage. Here we report that SET domain bifurcated 2 (Setdb2) was the only protein lysine methyltransferase induced during influenza virus infection. Setdb2 expression depended on type-I interferon signaling and it repressed the expression of the neutrophil attractant <italic>Cxcl1</italic> and other NF-&#x003ba;B target genes. This coincided with Setdb2 occupancy at the <italic>Cxcl1</italic> promoter, which in the absence of Setdb2 displayed reduced H3K9 tri-methylation. <italic>Setdb2</italic> hypomorphic gene-trap mice exhibited increased neutrophil infiltration in sterile lung inflammation and were less sensitive to bacterial superinfection upon influenza virus infection. This suggests that a Setdb2-mediated regulatory crosstalk between the type-I interferon and NF-&#x003ba;B pathways represents an important mechanism for virus-induced susceptibility to bacterial superinfection.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P4">Secondary bacterial pneumonia plays a predominant role in the morbidity of seasonal and pandemic influenza virus infection, thereby representing a significant clinical as well as socioeconomic challenge <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Virus-induced immune responses are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of bacterial superinfections, yet the molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood <sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Pathogen recognition by receptors such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, lead to the induction of two major pathways; type-I interferon (IFN) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B) signaling. The transcription of type I IFNs is regulated by the family of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) <sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Secreted IFNs bind to the ubiquitously expressed heteromeric receptor IFN&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; receptor 1 (IFNAR1) and IFNAR2, which results in the expression of a large number of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Many ISGs encode effector proteins, which mediate the defense against viruses and other pathogens <sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. The same triggering of TLRs can lead to the activation and nuclear translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B proteins, which in turn induce the expression of pro-inflammatory genes involved in antibacterial defense <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Type-I IFN and NF-&#x003ba;B signaling are subjected to multiple layers of regulation, which are required to maintain a balance between effective pathogen clearance, the prevention of tissue damage and disease tolerance <sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. This is of particular relevance in superinfections, where virus-induced host responses can lead to an increased susceptibility to bacterial infections through type I IFN-mediated interference with NF-&#x003ba;B signaling <sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Immune responses are shaped by chromatin modifications <sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Here, we have identified and functionally characterized the protein lysine methyltransferase (PKMT) SET domain bifurcated 2 (Setdb2, Uniprot: Q8C267) as an IFN-stimulated protein that modulates the expression of a subset of NF-&#x003ba;B target genes. Setdb2 belongs to the <italic>SUV39</italic> gene family, whose members share a Suvar 3-9/Enhancer-ofzeste/Trithorax (SET) domain that transfers methyl residues from S-adenosylmethionine to the amino group of target lysines thereby catalyzing H3K9 methylation <sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Setdb1, the closest related family member of Setdb2, is involved in pro-viral silencing, genomic stability and the onset of cancer <sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. To date, functional roles for Setdb2 have been implicated in embryonic development and cell division <sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. In this study we report a role for Setdb2 as a critical IFN-stimulated regulator of the immune system, which contributes to the molecular mechanisms of virus-induced susceptibility to bacterial superinfection.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="S1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S2"><title>Influenza virus infection induces Setdb2 expression</title><p id="P6">To identify novel regulatory immune mechanisms that are involved in virus-induced susceptibility to bacterial superinfection, we infected wild type (WT) mice with influenza virus and collected lung tissue at 18 hours after infection. At this early time point, the distribution of viral antigen was limited to a small percentage of epithelial cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref></bold>). We next performed a global expression profiling of lung tissue from infected and uninfected WT mice (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref></bold>). We identified more than 200 virus-induced genes with many of them being known ISGs <sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. A gene ontology (GO) analysis highlighted the enrichment of genes involved in IFN-mediated immune responses (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref></bold>), which included the GO terms interferon alpha and interferon beta signaling (Reactome:M973, p=0e<sup>0</sup>) and interferon-mediated immunity (Panther:BP00156, p=1.50e<sup>&#x02212;40</sup>) as well as chemokine signaling pathway (KEGG:M4844, p=4.85e<sup>&#x02212;14</sup>), toll-like receptor signaling pathway (KEGG:M3261, p=7.89e<sup>&#x02212;14</sup>), macrophage-mediated immunity (Panther:BD00155, p=5.00e<sup>&#x02212;12</sup>) and cytokine/chemokine-mediated immunity (Panther:BP00255, p=1.70e<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>). This was confirmed by the enrichment of transcription factor binding targets for <italic>Irf1</italic> (p-value 0e<sup>0</sup>), <italic>Irf8</italic> (0e<sup>0</sup>), <italic>Irf7</italic> (1.11e<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>) and <italic>Irf2</italic> (2.43e<sup>&#x02212;11</sup>) (<bold>Methods</bold>). Next, we analyzed the expression of the mouse orthologs of the previously annotated PKMTs <sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. This revealed Setdb2 as the only statistically significant PKMT that was induced upon influenza virus infection (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref></bold>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Type-I interferon signaling drives Setdb2 expression</title><p id="P7">We identified several putative IRF binding sites by motif scanning of the Setdb2 gene (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref></bold>, <bold>Methods</bold>). To study whether the induction of <italic>Setdb2</italic> depended on IFN signaling, we infected wild-type (WT) as well as <italic>Ifnar1<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup></italic>, <italic>Irf7<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup></italic> and <italic>Stat1<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup></italic> mice, each of them lacking key molecules required for IFN signaling, with influenza virus. We collected lung tissue at 18 hours after infection and detected increased expression of <italic>Setdb2</italic> in infected WT lungs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref></bold>). In contrast, the induction of <italic>Setdb2</italic> was strongly reduced in <italic>Ifnar1<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup></italic> lungs, indicating that type I IFN signaling is essential for <italic>Setdb2</italic> up-regulation <italic>in vivo</italic>. A reduction of <italic>Setdb2</italic> expression was also observed in <italic>Irf7<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup></italic> and <italic>Stat1<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup></italic> mice (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref></bold>). Similarly, infection of primary mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with influenza virus resulted in an IFNAR1-dependent up-regulation of <italic>Setdb2</italic> transcription (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref></bold>). To investigate protein expression, we raised a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the c-terminal region of mouse Setdb2 (clone 7H7F11, <bold>Methods</bold>). Consistent with RNA expression, we detected increased Setdb2 protein after infection of BMDMs in an IFNAR1-dependent manner (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref></bold>). Detection of the known IFN-stimulated protein Zbp1 (alias DAI) served as a control. Stimulation of BMDMs with IFN&#x003b2; (type I IFN), IFN-&#x003b3; (type II IFN) or IFN-&#x003bb; (type III IFN) revealed that Setdb2 and Zbp1 are induced by type I IFN as well as by type II IFN but not type III IFN (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref></bold>). The induction of Setdb2 by type II IFN was partially dependent on IFNAR1, indicating a secondary requirement for endogenous type I IFN <sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">Next, we elucidated the mRNA and protein expression profiles of Setdb2 after stimulation of BMDMs with the TLR2 agonist Pam(3)CSK(4) (PAM3), the synthetic viral RNA analog and TLR3 agonist polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) and the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS) <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Treatment of WT BMDMs resulted in up-regulation of <italic>Setdb2</italic> at the RNA and protein level (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref></bold>). Again, this induction was entirely dependent on type I IFN signaling, as <italic>Setdb2</italic> was not induced in <italic>Ifnar1<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup></italic> BMDMs. The induction of <italic>Setdb2</italic> and <italic>Zbp1</italic> upon PAM3 stimulation was TLR2-dependent (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref></bold>). In addition to Setdb2, stimulation of WT BMDMs with poly(I:C) led to induction of other PKMTs such as <italic>Setd1b</italic> and <italic>Prdm1</italic> (alias: <italic>Blimp1)</italic>, a well-studied regulator of B- and T-cells, that were however not altered upon influenza virus infection <italic>in vivo</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref></bold>). Elevated expression of <italic>Setdb2</italic> mRNA in WT BMDMs persisted for at least 24 hours (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref></bold>). Together, these data indicate that IFN signaling is required for the induction of Setdb2 both in viral infection and upon TLR stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Setdb2 modulates expression of NF-&#x003ba;B target genes</title><p id="P9">We generated <italic>Setdb2</italic> genetrap mice (<italic>Setdb2</italic><sup>GT/GT</sup>) to investigate the biological function of Setdb2 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref></bold> and <bold>Methods</bold>). Immunoblot analysis of spleen, lung and BMDMs showed a strong reduction of the Setdb2 protein in the hypomorphic <italic>Setdb2</italic><sup>GT/GT</sup> mice compared to WT controls (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref></bold>). Next, we compared the transcriptomes of poly(I:C)-stimulated WT and <italic>Setdb2</italic><sup>GT/GT</sup> BMDMs by RNAseq. This revealed a significant enrichment of known NF-&#x003ba;B target genes among the up-regulated transcripts in <italic>Setdb2</italic><sup>GT/GT</sup> BMDMs (p-value = 1.35&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Tables 4</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">5</xref></bold> and <bold>Methods</bold>). These NF-&#x003ba;B target genes represented a subset of genes including <italic>Cxcl1, Il12b, S100a8/9, Lcn2, Cxcl2, Chi3l1</italic> and <italic>Ltf</italic>, each of which has been implicated in antibacterial defense. Other established NF-&#x003ba;B regulated genes such as <italic>Il6</italic>, however, were not affected (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 4</xref></bold>). Upstream activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B cascade as measured by &#x00399;&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; degradation showed no difference between stimulated WT and <italic>Setdb2</italic><sup>GT/GT</sup> BMDMs (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref></bold>), suggesting that Setdb2 acts downstream of &#x00399;&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;-mediated NF-&#x003ba;B activation.</p><p id="P10">One of the genes found with particularly high levels of expression in poly(I:C) stimulated <italic>Setdb2</italic><sup>GT/GT</sup> BMDMs was <italic>Cxcl1.</italic> This encodes a key chemoattractant for neutrophils, a type of leukocyte shown to be critically involved in bacterial clearance in superinfection <sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Thus, we decided to focus on the effects of Setdb2-mediated regulation of <italic>Cxcl1</italic>. Indeed, stimulation with different TLR agonists resulted in the induction of significantly more <italic>Cxcl1</italic> transcripts in <italic>Setdb2</italic><sup>GT/GT</sup> BMDMs as compared to WT controls (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref></bold>). This finding was confirmed at the level of protein secreted by BMDM (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref></bold>). To investigate the effects of type I IFN signaling on <italic>Cxcl1</italic> expression, we stimulated BMDMs with poly(I:C) in the presence of IFNAR1-blocking antibodies. This led to diminished levels of <italic>Setdb2</italic> mRNA, which correlated inversely with the expression of <italic>Cxcl1</italic> mRNA (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref></bold>). These differences were seen not only in WT but also in <italic>Setdb2<sup>GT/GT</sup></italic> BMDMs, which may be due to the residual levels of Setdb2 in the <italic>Setdb2<sup>GT/GT</sup></italic> BMDMs and/or another IFN-I driven Setdb2-independent pathway. Finally, infection with influenza virus strain PR8 led to increased CXCL1 expression in <italic>Setdb2</italic><sup>GT/GT</sup> compared to WT BMDMs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e, f</xref></bold>). These data suggest that Setdb2 is a negative regulator of a subset of NF-&#x003ba;B target genes.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Setdb2 mediates H3K9 tri-methylation at the <italic>Cxcl1</italic> promoter</title><p id="P11">Methyltransferases of the SUV39 family preferentially methylate the histone substrate H3K9 <sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Setdb2 was shown to catalyze the addition of the repressive mark H3K9me3 <sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. We, therefore, hypothesized that Setdb2 would inhibit <italic>Cxcl1</italic> expression by introducing repressive marks in the <italic>Cxcl1</italic> promoter region. To test if Setdb2 was able to bind to the <italic>Cxcl1</italic> promoter, we used the Setdb2-specific mAb clone 7H7F11 to perform chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments.

Type I IFN and NF-&#x003ba;B signaling are two important pathways for this process and are subjected to multiple layers of crosstalk, many of which are still poorly understood.

The Setdb2-related SUV39 family members Suv39H1, Ehmt1 (alias: Glp) and Ehmt2 (alias: G9a) were shown to be involved in immunological processes such as the modulation of ISG expression, the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway and T cell differentiation <sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>.

Notably, single nucleotide polymorphisms in human <italic>SETDB2</italic> were shown to be associated with increased IgE production and atopic asthma <sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>, highlighting the proposed role of Setdb2 in regulating inflammation. This evolutionary strategy, however, may turn into a double-edged sword during bacterial superinfection, by causing impaired bacterial clearance and severe tissue damage. Previously, type I IFN signaling was shown to have a detrimental role in the pathogenesis of virus-induced susceptibility to bacterial superinfection <sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Accordingly, Setdb2 may be responsible and mediate at least parts of this important type I IFN-dependent mechanism.</p><p id="P19">Chromatin modifiers can be recruited to their targets through specific interactions with transcriptional regulators and/or chromatin-associated factors. We hypothesize that a similar mechanism facilitates the specific recruitment of Setdb2 to its target gene promoters to introduce repressive H3K9me3 chromatin marks. Yet, we cannot exclude the possibility that Setdb2 may recruit other methyltransferases or transcription factors. Likewise, the function of Setdb2 may be determined by mutually non-exclusive cellular and immunological parameters (e.g. cell type, inflammatory state, pathogen type) as well as by the complex epigenetic context of multivalent chromatin modifications <sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>.

In this study we observed increased CXCL1 expression in the lungs of influenza virus infected <italic>Setdb2</italic><sup>GT/GT</sup> compared to WT mice.

The increased CXCL1 expression in <italic>Setdb2</italic><sup>GT/GT</sup> mice manifested phenotypically only upon superinfection as elevated numbers of neutrophils in the lungs.
