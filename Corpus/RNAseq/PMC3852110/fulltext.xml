Human miR-146 family members are known as inflammation-inducible miRNAs involved in negative feedback regulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling.

In turn, knockdown of miR-146 itself had no major effects on the expression of known targets of MyD88-Traf6 signalling.

A balanced output of the vertebrate immune response is dependent on several regulatory mechanisms, in which microRNAs (miRNAs) have recently emerged as new players with critical importance
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Several human diseases, including cancer, autoimmune diseases, and chronic inflammatory disorders, have been associated with dysregulation of miRNA expression both in a positive or negative regulatory manner
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. MiRNAs are evolutionary conserved, genome-encoded small RNAs (~22 nucleotides) that down-regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by either translational repression or by mRNA degradation through binding to the 3&#x02032;-UTR of their target mRNAs
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. MiRNAs were found to have roles in a diverse range of processes ranging from development, cellular differentiation, hematopoiesis, apoptosis, and growth, to the functioning of the immune system
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The role of host miRNAs in bacterial infections has been addressed in several previous studies. MiRNAs were observed to be differentially regulated by Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated recognition of bacterial molecules. For instance, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of TLR4 and downstream NF&#x003ba;B activity induced miR-146, miR-147, and miR-155
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Mice deficient in miR-155 could not be protected by vaccination against <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> infection and showed strong defects in T-cell cytokine production
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In another study, <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> infection was found to induce rapid down-regulation of let-7 miRNA family members in macrophages, thereby leading to an upregulation of let-7 targets, the IL-6 and IL-10 cytokines
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. IL-10 production in LPS-stimulated macrophages was also found to be regulated by miR-98
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, miR-29 was found to suppress immune responses to <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> by targeting IFN-&#x003b3;
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The LPS-inducible miR-146 family comprises two members in human, miR-146a and miR-146b, which are transcribed from different genes on chromosome 5 and 10, respectively
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. They have the same seed sequence (i.e. the sequence essential for the binding of the miRNA to its mRNA target) and differ in their mature sequence by only two nucleotides at the 3&#x02032;end. Dysregulation of miR-146a and miR-146b has been observed in many types of malignant tumors and several studies implicate these miRNAs as metastasis suppressors
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. MiR-146a has also been implicated in different autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and Sj&#x000f6;gren&#x02019;s syndrome
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The first indication of the role of miR-146a/b in innate immunity came from work of Taganov et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], showing increased expression of these miRNAs in the human monocytic THP-1 cell line when triggered by LPS. Promoter analysis revealed that induction of the miR-146a gene by LPS, TNF&#x003b1;, and IL-1 is mediated by the NF&#x003ba;B transcription factor
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition, 3&#x02032;-UTR luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that the TLR signalling intermediates IRAK1 and TRAF6 are potential targets of miR-146a and miR-146b
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These data suggested that the miR-146 miRNAs function in a negative feedback pathway of TLR and cytokine signalling by targeting <italic>IRAK1</italic> and <italic>TRAF6</italic> mRNAs for down-regulation, a conclusion supported by recent analysis of miR-146a knockout mice
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. MiR-146a has also been shown to function as a negative regulator of interferon (IFN) signalling by targeting the IRF5 and STAT-1 transcription factors
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and to control the resolution of T-cell responses in mice
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>The zebrafish provides a useful model to study innate immunity, which is the primary line of defence against infections during the first few weeks of development, when functional adaptive immunity is not yet present
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The zebrafish model combines an efficient genetic toolbox with excellent possibilities for high resolution imaging of host-microbe interactions at the early life stages (embryos and larvae), when zebrafish are transparent
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Many zebrafish infection models for bacterial pathogens have recently been developed, among which the <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> and <italic>M. marinum</italic> models are the best characterized
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The major signalling pathways of the innate immune system are conserved within all vertebrates
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and the repertoire of zebrafish miRNAs is well described
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Since miRNAs are strongly conserved among all vertebrates, the advantages of the zebrafish model organism may be exploited to elucidate miRNA functions in the vertebrate host response to bacterial infections. As in mammals, the zebrafish miR-146 family has two members, named dre-miR-146a and dre-miR-146b, which are present within genes located on chromosome 13 and 21, respectively. The <italic>IRAK1</italic> and <italic>TRAF6</italic> homologs of both zebrafish and human contain putative target sites for miR-146 in their 3&#x02032;-UTRs, suggesting that miR-146 feedback control of TLR signalling is evolutionary conserved. Here we report on a microarray study of miRNA expression, which showed that miR-146a and miR-146b are commonly induced by infection of zebrafish embryos with <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> and by infection of adult fish with <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic>. We demonstrate the requirement of the MyD88-Traf6 pathway for the infection-triggered induction of miR-146a/b in the zebrafish embryo model. Furthermore, we used morpholino knockdown to suppress the function of miR-146a and miR-146b and analyzed the effects of this down-regulation by RNA deep sequencing (RNAseq) of embryos infected with <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>. While no major effects on known targets of the MyD88-Traf6 pathway were observed, apolipoprotein-mediated lipid transport emerged as a novel infection-inducible pathway under control of miR-146a/b.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Microarray analysis identifies infection-inducible miRNAs in zebrafish embryos and adults</title><p>In order to study the effects of bacterial infection on miRNA expression profiles in zebrafish we examined two infection conditions that are known from previous mRNA transcriptome studies to elicit a strong proinflammatory immune response: embryos at 8&#x000a0;hours post infection (hpi) with the <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> SL1027 strain and adult fish that were in the end stage of disease at 6&#x000a0;days post infection (dpi) with the <italic>M. marinum</italic> Mma20 strain
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Since embryos rely solely on innate immunity and adults also have adaptive immunity, the combination of these infection models allows determining the contribution of the two arms of the immune system to the induction of miRNAs
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. To quantify microRNA gene expression profiles we used a custom designed 8&#x000d7;15 k Agilent zebrafish array. <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> infection of one-day old embryos resulted in differential expression of probes for 15 miRNAs annotated in miRBase (8 up-regulated, 7 down-regulated), while the <italic>M. marinum</italic>-infected adults showed differential expression of probes for 57 miRNAs (37 up-regulated, 20 down-regulated) (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A,B). The miRNA platform also contains probes for predicted hairpin structures in the zebrafish genome that might cover additional miRNAs. A large number of these probes showed differentially expression in the adult infection study (235 up-regulated, 687 down-regulated), while a much lower number was affected by infection of embryos (27 up-regulated, 37 down-regulated). Since the biological relevance of these predicted small RNAs is currently unknown, we did not consider them further in this study, but focused on the known miRNAs annotated in miRBase. Several of these miRNAs were commonly up-regulated by both of the infection conditions, including miR-21 (mature miRNA and its star sequence), miR-29a, miR-29b, miR-146a, and miR-146b (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). Since zebrafish embryos have not yet developed adaptive immunity, it can be concluded that the context of innate immunity is sufficient to induce the expression of these miRNAs.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Microarray analysis of miRNA expression during bacterial infections of zebrafish embryos and adult fish.</bold> The Venn diagrams show the miRBase annotated miRNAs or miRNA star sequences (*) that were up-regulated <bold>(A)</bold> or down-regulated <bold>(B)</bold> during infection of zebrafish embryos with <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> SL1027 or infection of adult zebrafish with <italic>M. marinum</italic> Mma20. <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> infection of embryos was performed by micro-injection into the caudal vein at 28 hpf and miRNA expression was analyzed at 8 hpi in comparison with control embryos mock-injected with PBS.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. To confirm the induction of these miR-146 family members we analyzed miR-146a and miR-146b expression by TaqMan qPCR analysis. MiR-222, which showed unaltered expression in the microarray study, was used as a control for normalization. In agreement with the microarray data, miR-146a and b were specifically induced in embryos at 8&#x000a0;hours post injection (hpi) with the <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> SL1027 strain (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A). Their induction was also observed in infections with an attenuated LPS mutant (Ra) strain, SF1592 (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B). Furthermore, induction of miR-146a and miR-146b was detected in zebrafish larvae at an advanced stage of <italic>M. marinum</italic> Mma20 infection (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C). The increase of miR-146a expression in embryos infected with <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> could be completely blocked with a morpholino targeting this miRNA (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A,B) and this morpholino was effective even up to the larval stage in reducing <italic>M. marinum</italic>-induced miR-146a expression (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C). The <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>-induction of miR-146b in embryos could also be reduced by morpholino treatment, (Figure&#x000a0;

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], we next analyzed the separate effects of miR-146a and miR-146b knockdown in more detail over a critical period of leukocyte development from 26 to 32 hpf. During this period primitive myeloid cells first appear over the yolk sac, and subsequently invade the head. This first wave of primitive myeloid cells is rapidly followed by differentiation of the first erythro-myeloid precursor cells in the caudal blood island region. We performed L-plastin immunostaining with 2&#x000a0;h intervals over the period from 26 to 32 hpf. The total number of L-plastin-positive leukocytes showed a similar increase over this time course between control embryos and embryos injected with 146aMO1, 146aMO2, or 146bMO1 (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>E-I). 146bMO2 could not be included in this quantitative analysis because it affected embryo development. Nevertheless, L-plastin positive immune cells were still present in 146bMO2 morphants with mild (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>J) or severe phenotypes (Figure&#x000a0;

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], we hypothesized that miR-146 knockdown might have a similar effect.

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A). First we analyzed the basal expression differences between morpholino knockdown and the control in mock-injected embryos.

The induction of members of the miR-21, miR-29, and miR-146 families was in line with earlier microarray studies, which reported these along with some other miRNAs, like miR-9, miR-132, miR-147, and miR-155 as infection-inducible

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Therefore, miR-146a and miR-146b of zebrafish may function in feedback control of TLR signalling, like the human and murine counterparts
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. To study the pathway by which miR-146 expression is induced in zebrafish embryos upon infection we used embryos in which TLR signalling was disrupted by morpholino knockdown of <italic>traf6</italic> or by mutation of <italic>myd88</italic>. The induction levels of miR-146a and miR-146b upon <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> infection were reduced under conditions of <italic>traf6</italic> or <italic>myd88</italic> deficiency, but induction was not completely abolished. In the case of <italic>traf6</italic> deficiency, the residual induction of miRNA expression may be due to a partial morpholino knockdown effect.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Therefore, it is likely that both the MyD88-Traf6-dependent pathway and parallel MyD88-independent signalling routes contribute to the infection-induced expression of miR-146.</p><p>A recent study by Ghani et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] suggested miR-146a to be required for myeloid cell differentiation in mouse and zebrafish. They reported that miR-146a morpholino knockdown caused an almost complete absence of myeloid cells in zebrafish embryos at 1 dpf. However, in our analysis we found no evidence for an inhibitory effect of miR-146 deficiency on myeloid cell development. We used two morpholinos for miR-146a (one of which was the same as a miR-146a morpholino used by Ghani et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]), and verified the knockdown effect by TaqMan qPCR, which showed that the morpholinos effectively inhibited both the basal expression and the infection-induced expression. By immunostaining for the pan-leukocytic marker L-plastin we detected no differences in myeloid cell development between miR-146a morphants and controls over an elaborate time course between 26 and 32 hpf, which comprises the critical embryonic stages when myeloid cells differentiate and enter the circulation. Furthermore, no effect on neutrophil differentiation at 2 dpf was detected. For miR-146b we also did not observe an effect on leukocyte development with two different morpholinos targeting this miRNA. Ghani et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] used mRNA in situ hybridization for detection of L-plastin, which might explain the difference with our study in which we used a sensitive immunolabelling method, which is widely used for detection and quantification of myeloid cells in zebrafish embryos
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Our conclusion that myeloid development in zebrafish embryos is not inhibited by miR-146a or miR-146b deficiencies is in line with the phenotype of miR-146a knockout mice, which also were not impaired in myeloid differentiation but in fact showed hyperproliferation of myeloid cells leading to autoimmunity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Knockout mice of miR-146a are hyperresponsive to LPS, showing increased up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF and IL-6
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. We used <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> infection of zebrafish embryos, which results in strong pro-inflammatory gene induction, to analyze the knockdown effect of miR-146a and miR146b by RNAseq analysis. We used a combination of morpholinos against miR-146a and miR-146b in the RNAseq study to avoid that the two miRNAs might compensate for each other&#x02019;s loss-of-function, as their mature sequences differ only by two nucleotides. Several genes in the p53 pathway, including p53 itself, were up-regulated in miR-146 morphants as compared to controls under infected as well as non-infected conditions. This might be attributed to the well known off target effects of morpholino oligonucleotides
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. However, as miR-146 has been frequently linked with cancer, a direct effect on the p53 pathway cannot be excluded
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. In fact, one of the p53 pathway genes up-regulated by miR-146 knockdown, <italic>cdkn1a</italic> (p21), is an experimentally validated target of miR-146a in human
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. In total we found 73 genes which were significantly up-regulated in miR-146 infection as compared to control infection.

Expression levels of other known targets of miR-146 involved in innate immunity, such as <italic>irak1</italic>, <italic>traf6, irf5</italic> and <italic>stat1</italic>, were not affected, but this was not unexpected since miRNAs can act by translational inhibition.</p><p>The matrix metalloproteinase gene <italic>mmp9</italic> is one of the most strongly induced pro-inflammatory markers in <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> infection
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The combined morpholino knockdown of miR-146a and miR-146b led to slightly increased induction of this gene during <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> infection; however, this induction of <italic>mmp9</italic> was not accompanied by a general hyperinduction of other pro-inflammatory markers in the RNAseq analysis. <italic>MMP9</italic> is not a predicted target gene of miR-146 in human or zebrafish, but human <italic>MMP9</italic> was found to be down-regulated upon miR-146a/b overexpression in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and in THP-1 macrophages
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].

Likewise, the induction of zebrafish <italic>mmp9</italic> under miR-146a/b knockdown conditions might be an indirect consequence of effects on upstream signalling proteins. In agreement, we have previously shown that <italic>mmp9</italic> induction by <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> infection is mediated by Traf6, which is a known target of miR-146

However, in our study of <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> infection in zebrafish embryos, miR-146 knockdown did not have a strong impact on the induction of proinflammatory genes.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], while in the case of miR-146 knockdown only <italic>mmp9</italic> was slightly higher induced. Furthermore, hyperinflammation in <italic>ptpn6</italic> morphants impaired control of <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> infection
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], while miR-146 knockdown had no such effect (data not shown). These results support that in the early response of zebrafish embryos to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>typhimurium</italic> infection Ptpn6 functions as a much stronger negative feedback regulator than miR-146. This would be consistent with the idea that miRNAs function in a subtle fine-tuning of the immune response

A similar effect on LDL accumulation was observed by silencing miR-155, another important miRNA regulator of immune processes

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In a microarray analysis of miRNA expression in zebrafish, both of the miR-146 family members, miR-146a and miR-146b, were found to be inducible by <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> and <italic>M. marinum</italic> infections. The miR-146 family members were commonly induced during infections of embryos and adult fish, along with miRNAs of the miR-21 and miR-29 families, which also have been implicated in immunity and infection. The induction of these miRNAs in embryo infection models links them specifically with the innate immune response, as adaptive immunity is not yet functional at early developmental stages. We exploited the embryo model as an <italic>in vivo</italic> system to investigate the role of miR-146 in the innate immune response to <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> infection. Induction of miR-146a and miR-146b by infection was shown to be affected by deficiencies in Traf6 and Myd88, which are central intermediates of Toll-like receptor and cytokine signalling pathways. MiR-146 has previously been implicated in negative feed-back regulation of these pathways
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], similar to a number of signalling proteins, including the protein-tyrosine phosphatase Ptpn6
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. However, whereas knockdown of the <italic>ptpn6</italic> gene caused hyperinflammation in zebrafish embryos
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], knockdown of miR-146 in <italic>the S. typhimurium</italic> embryo infection model had no major effect on pro-inflammatory gene expression or on the expression of transcriptional regulators and signal transduction components of known immune response mediators.

The 15&#x000a0;k custom design was obtained from Edwin Cuppen and Eugene Berezikov (Hubrecht Institute, Utrecht, The Netherlands) and has been submitted into the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GPL 15403). The 15&#x000a0;k design contained a duplicate of 7604 probes of 60-oligonucleotide length. The probes consisted of 2x22 nucleotide sequences antisense to mature miRNAs separated by a spacer of 8 nucleotides (CGATCTTT) and with a second spacer with the same sequence at the end. From 7604 probes 546 were designed for left (5&#x02032;) and right (3&#x02032;) arms of the hairpins of zebrafish miRNAs that are known in miRBase, while the remainder 7058 probes corresponded to predicted hairpin structures in the zebrafish genome that might include additional miRNAs. Total RNA, including microRNA, was extracted from pools of 20&#x02013;30 embryos or from individual adult fish using the miRNeasy Mini Kit&#x000ae; (Qiagen). Three biological replicates were used for each condition. RNA labelling was carried out with the miRCURY&#x02122; LNA microRNA, Hy3&#x02122;/Hy5&#x02122; Power Labelling kit (Exiqon) using 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of total RNA according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. RNA samples from infected embryos or adults were labelled with Hy3 and hybridized against Hy5-labelled RNA samples from PBS-injected controls. The dual color hybridization of the microarray chips was performed according to Agilent protocol GE2_105_Jan09 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.Agilent.com">http://www.Agilent.com</ext-link>) for two-color microarray-based gene expression analysis except that hybridization and washing was performed at 37&#x000b0;C. The arrays were scanned with DNA Microarray Scanner G2505B from Agilent Technologies. The arrays were scanned twice with 10% PMT and 100% PMT laser power. Microarray data was processed from raw data image files with Feature Extraction Software 9.5.3.1 (Agilent Technologies). The XDR function was used to extend the dynamic range. Processed data were subsequently imported into Rosetta Resolver 7.1 (Rosetta Biosoftware, Seattle, Washington) and subjected to default ratio error modelling. Ratio results from control vs. infected replicates were combined using the default ratio experiment builder. Significance cut-offs for the ratios of infected versus control were set at 1.5-fold change at P&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;10&#x02009;-&#x02009;4. Significance cut-offs for DEseq analysis were set at: absolute fold change &#x02265;1.5 and adjusted P-value&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.1. The raw data have been submitted to GEO under accession number GSE45410.</p></sec><sec><title>Morpholino knockdown</title><p>Morpholino oligonucleotides (GeneTools) were diluted to the desired concentration in 1&#x000d7; Danieau buffer (58&#x000a0;mM NaCl, 0.7&#x000a0;mM KCl, 0.4&#x000a0;mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.6&#x000a0;mM Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, 5.0&#x000a0;mM HEPES; pH&#x000a0;7.6) containing 1% phenol red (Sigma-Aldrich) and approximately 1&#x000a0;nl was injected at the 1&#x02013;2 cell stage using a Femtojet injector (Eppendorf). For knockdown of miR-146a and miR-146b two morpholinos were used against each of them. The first morpholino for miR-146a (146aMO1: 5&#x02032;ACCATCTATGGAATTCAGTTCTCAG3&#x02032;) targets the miRNA guide strand and the second morpholino (146aMO2: 5&#x02032;GAGCCCAUAGAUGAACUUUUCAUGA3&#x02032;) overlaps with the star strand and the dicer cleavage site on the star strand (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1A). For miR-146b, the first morpholino (146bMO1: 5&#x02032;GACACCCTTGGAATTCAGTTCTCAA3&#x02032;) also targets the guide strand, and the second morpholino (146bMO2: 5&#x02032;CGTGGGCTGAATATAAAGCAGACAC3&#x02032;) overlaps with both dicer cleavage sites and part of the star strand (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1B). All miR-146 morpholinos could be used at a concentration of 0.75&#x000a0;mM without causing morphological defects, except146b-MO2, which was highly toxic. Another morpholino design for miR-146b was not recommended by GeneTools. For <italic>traf6</italic> knockdown we used a previously described morpholino
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. As a control the standard control morpholino (scMO) from GeneTools was used as previously described

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Fluorescence images were taken with a Leica MZ16FA stereo fluorescence microscope equipped with a DFC420C digital color camera. Histochemical detection of neutrophils was performed by Mpx activity staining using the Peroxidase Leukocyte Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) as previously described
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>RNAseq analysis</title><p>For RNAseq analysis, embryos were injected with a combination of 146aMO1 and 146bMO1, or with the scMO. Subsequently, at 28 hpf they were infected with <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> or mock-injected with PBS, and RNA was isolated from pools of at least 50 embryos at 8&#x000a0;hours post injection (hpi). Two independent experiments were performed for RNAseq analysis of biological duplicates. A total of 3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of RNA was used to make RNAseq libraries using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit v2 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, USA). In the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions two modifications were made. In the adapter ligation step 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l instead of 2.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l adapter was used. In the library size selection step the library fragments were isolated with a double Ampure XP purification with a 0.7&#x000d7; beads to library ratio. The resulting mRNA-Seq library was sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq2000 instrument according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s description with a read length of 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;50 nucleotides. Image analysis and base calling was done by the Illumina HCS version 1.15.1. Sequence reads were quality trimmed using the quality_trim module in the CLCbio Assembly Cell v4.0.6. Filtered reads were mapped to Ensembl transcripts (Zv9_63) using the ref_assemble_short module in the CLCbio Assembly Cell v4.0.6. Accumulation of transcripts to Ensembl genes was done by first converting the mapping files to a table with the assembly_table module in the CLCbio Assembly Cell v4.0.6. Secondly a custom script was used that sums all reads belonging to a transcript. Non-uniquely mapped reads were divided between transcripts according to their ratio of uniquely mapped reads. Finally, read counts of transcripts belonging to the same gene were summed to obtain count data at Ensembl gene level. Fold-change and differential expression significance values were calculated from gene level read counts using the DESeq package (version 1.8.3) available in Bioconductor (version 2.10). DESeq utilizes a negative binomial distribution for modeling read counts per gene and implements a method for normalizing the counts

Reactions were kept on ice for 5&#x000a0;min and then were transferred to the thermal cycler for incubations at 16&#x000b0;C and 42&#x000b0;C for 30&#x000a0;min each, followed by an incubation at 85&#x000b0;C for 5&#x000a0;min. Quantitative RT-PCR with 0.665&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l cDNA input per reaction was performed using a Custom TaqMan small RNA Assay for each miRNA and a TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystem) in a total of 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l per reaction. Cycle threshold values were calculated under the parameters of 40&#x000a0;cycles of 10&#x000a0;min at 95&#x000b0;C, 15&#x000a0;sec at 95&#x000b0;C and 60&#x000a0;sec at 60&#x000b0;C. All reactions were performed in triplicate. For normalization, miR-222, which showed no changes in response to bacterial challenge, was taken as reference.
