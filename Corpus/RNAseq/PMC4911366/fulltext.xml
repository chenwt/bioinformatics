However, whether tissue-specific methylation patterns are conserved across species is not known. We used comparative methylome analysis of base-resolution DNA methylation profiles from the liver and brain of mouse and zebrafish generated by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing to identify the conserved and divergent aspects of the methylome in these commonly used vertebrate model organisms. On average, 24% of CpGs are methylated in mouse livers and the pattern of methylation was highly concordant among four male mice from two different strains. The same level of methylation (24.2%) was identified in mouse brain. In striking contrast, zebrafish had 63 and 70% of CpG methylation in the liver and brain, respectively. This is attributed, in part, to the higher percentage of the zebrafish genome occupied by transposable elements (52% vs. 45% in mice). Thus, the species identity was more significant in determining methylome patterning than was the similarity in organ function. Conserved features of the methylome across tissues and species was the exclusion of methylation from promoters and from CpG islands near transcription start sites, and the clustering of methylated CpGs in gene bodies and intragenic regions. These data suggest that DNA methylation reflects species-specific genome structure, and supports the notion that DNA methylation in non-promoter regions may contribute to genome evolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>comparative epigenomics</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd><kwd>liver</kwd><kwd>brain</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Foundation for the National Institutes of Health<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000009</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">5R01DK080789</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">1R01DK099558</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="60"/><page-count count="15"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytosine methylation is a major epigenetic mark in many species, as it serves to significantly alter the accessibility of CpG sites across the genome (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Deaton and Bird, 2011</xref>). The methylome changes dramatically during development (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Singer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>), and there are marked differences in pattern of methylation across different cell types and in many pathologies, most notably, cancer. Indeed, many studies using model organisms demonstrate a required role for DNA methylation in regulating vertebrate development (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bird, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Messerschmidt et al., 2014</xref>) and in causing cancer (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Eden et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Gaudet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Howard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Mudbhary et al., 2014</xref>). The canonical functions for DNA methylation are to promote genomic imprinting (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 1993</xref>), X-chromosome inactivation (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Boumil and Lee, 2001</xref>), preservation of chromosome stability (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Crocitto, 1999</xref>) and transposon repression (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Slotkin and Martienssen, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Zemach et al., 2010</xref>); these functions are largely conserved across taxa. However, not all species methylate their genomes, and those that do exhibit a wide range of DNA methylation levels and patterns (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Zemach et al., 2010</xref>). Even when the same region of the brain is compared between closely related species (humans and chimpanzees), marked differences in methylation levels and the pattern of methylation have been reported (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Zeng et al., 2012</xref>). Whether the species-specific methylome difference reflects functional differences played by DNA methylation in different organisms or, instead, whether they mirror, and perhaps contribute to, genome evolution remains an open and important question.</p><p>Many studies on DNA methylation are based on the hypothesis that methylation serves to repress gene expression (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">McGhee and Ginder, 1979</xref>). There are, however, many exceptions to this pattern, and, indeed, it is now widely accepted that differences in promoter methylation play a regulatory role in only a few well publicized cases. In contrast, overwhelming evidence shows that, across cell types and species, 1000s of silenced genes have entirely unmethylated promoters and, conversely, many highly expressed genes have high levels of promoter methylation (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bestor et al., 2015</xref>). While CpG islands (CpGi) exert regulatory function on gene expression, their protection from DNA methylation is a conserved feature of CpGis (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Long et al., 2016</xref>). However, the picture is becoming more complex, as recent work has shown that enhancer methylation is correlated with gene expression in developing zebrafish and other vertebrates (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bogdanovi&#x00107; et al., 2016</xref>) and other studies show that moderately expressed genes do not have a strong correlation with methylation differences at upstream regulatory regions, but instead these genes are highly methylated throughout the gene body (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Elliott et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the understanding of how DNA methylation impacts gene expression is evolving.</p><p>Comparative methylome analysis across taxa has uncovered widely divergent methylation patterns across species (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Zemach et al., 2010</xref>), supporting the conclusion that methylation cannot be a universal mechanism of repressing gene expression, or, perhaps, that DNA methylation may serve different functions across the branches of the phylogenetic tree. In contrast, the high level of methylation of transposable elements (TEs) is a feature of DNA methylation that is conserved from plants to animals (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Zemach et al., 2010</xref>). This is proposed to be a central mechanism to repress the potentially catastrophic activation of these endogenous parasites (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Yoder et al., 1997</xref>). Comparative studies further supported the hypothesis that DNA methylation function is nuanced and variable. Moreover, the stark differences in DNA methylation between vertebrates and invertebrates limit studies on the functional consequences of methylome repatterning to vertebrate models such as mouse and zebrafish.</p><p>We reasoned that if DNA methylation is a central mechanism of regulating gene expression, then this should be reflected in conserved methylation patterns of genes that have similar expression patterns across species. The liver serves a fundamental role in metabolic homeostasis in all vertebrates, and this is reflected in a shared pattern of gene expression from humans to fish (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Lam et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Mudbhary et al., 2014</xref>). We selected this organ for comparative methylome analysis between mouse and zebrafish because there are striking similarities in liver cell composition and function (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Goessling and Sadler, 2015</xref>). Studies in zebrafish also show that accurate DNA methylation is essential for liver development and regeneration (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Sadler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Jacob et al., 2015</xref>) and that loss of methylation causes liver cancer (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Mirbahai et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Multiple approaches have been developed and used to characterize genome-wide DNA methylation (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Reid, 2010</xref>). Of these, reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) is a cost-efficient method to survey CpG methylation genome wide by sampling regions of the genome that are CpG rich for bisulfite sequencing (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Gu et al., 2011</xref>). A drawback to this approach is that it mainly covers CpG islands at the expense of other genomic regions, In order to represent more CpG sites and increase the coverage of all genomic regions interrogated, a recently published enhanced RRBS (ERRBS; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Akalin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2015</xref>) allows greater distribution across the genome of the mapped reads from bisulfite converted genomic DNA. Hepatic function and the population of hepatic cells is similar between zebrafish and mammals (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Goessling and Sadler, 2015</xref>) and we asked whether these similarities would be reflected by conserved features of the methylome. We used ERRBS to generate single-nucleotide resolution DNA methylation map of the mouse liver and compared this to a previously described methylome analysis of zebrafish liver generated by RRBS. We report marked interspecies differences in methylation patterns, and by comparing the methylation landscape between liver and brain of mouse and zebrafish, we found that the difference between species is much more significant than differences between tissues of the same species. Our findings suggest that genome structure is the primarily determinant of methylome patterning.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Sample Preparation</title><p>The four mouse samples (Mixed-1, Mixed-2, B6-1, and B6-2) that were used for bisulfite sequencing are all males and are from two different genetic backgrounds: B6-1 and B6-2 are C57BL/6 mice, whereas the mixed mice are on an undefined background including C57BL/6J and other strains. Total livers were isolated from them between 6 and 8 weeks old and frozen at -80&#x000b0;C for DNA isolation. Genomic DNA was extracted from each sample using the Qiagen DNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instruction. RNA was purified using Qiagen RNAeasy columns. The animal work was approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Brigham and Women&#x02019;s Hospital (mixed samples) and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (C57BL/6 samples).</p></sec><sec><title>Enhanced Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (ERRBS) Library Preparation and Sequencing</title><p>Bisulfite-converted DNA sequencing libraries were generated for each of the studied samples, which measure both 5hmC and 5mC in methylated fraction and 5fC, 5caC, and C in unmethylated fraction. In brief, 50 ng of high quality genomic DNA in 50 &#x003bc;l of DNase-free water was used as starting material. The whole library preparation includes enzyme digestion of genomic DNA which enriched CpG rich regions, Phenol:chloroform clean up, End-repair, A-tailing, adapter ligation, size selection, bisulfite conversion, enrichment PCR, and quality control.

These amplified libraries were sequenced on the Hiseq2000 platform for 50 cycles single end read runs at the Epigenomics Core facility in the Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College (New York, NY, USA). Image capture, analysis and base calling were performed using Illumina&#x02019;s CASAVA 1.8. Data is available in GEO, accession numbers are GSM2136660, GSM2136661, GSM2136662, and GSM2136663.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA Sequencing Library Preparation and Sequencing</title><p>For each of the mouse samples, Mixed-1, Mixed-2 and an additional mixed background age-matched mouse from the Brigham and Women&#x02019;s facility (Mixed-3), RNAseq libraries were prepared according to Illumina&#x02019;s TruSeq RNA sample preparation version2 protocol. The 3 samples were sequenced using Illumina&#x02019;s HiSeq 2500 platform (100bp paired-end sequencing) generating &#x0223c;64 million reads, &#x0223c;60 million reads and &#x0223c;53 million reads for samples Mixed-1, Mixed-2, and Mixed-3, respectively.</p><p>The sequencing quality was assessed using FASTQC (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Andrew, 2010</xref>) and the reads were quality trimmed using Trimmomatic (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>; for low <italic>Q</italic>-scores, adapter contamination and systematic sequencing errors). After quality trimming, only the fragments that retained the forward and reverse reads were kept, any reads with a length less than 36 bp after quality trimming were discarded. For all three samples, the quality trimming step resulted in a &#x0223c;3% data loss.</p><p>The reads were then aligned to the Mus Musculus GRCm38.p4 reference genome assembly using TopHat (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2013</xref>) version 2.1.0. Overall alignment rates were 97% for Mixed-1, 98% for Mixed-2, and 97% for Mixed-3. The resulting BAM alignment files were then passed through Cufflinks (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Trapnell et al., 2012</xref>) version 2.2.1 in order to calculate gene level FPKM values.</p></sec><sec><title>Read Alignment and Methylation Calls</title><p>Enhanced reduced representation bisulfite sequencing reads were mapped on the mouse genome (mm10) with the use of the BSMAP mapping tool (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Xi and Li, 2009</xref>). The percentages of DNA methylation levels based on bisulfite conversation yield were computed at the single-nucleotide scale. We simulated a range of genome coverage from 5 to 20 and applied statistical analysis of differential methylation which demonstrated that only positions represented by at least 10&#x000d7; coverage (i.e., CpG<sub>10</sub>) yielded a dataset that had sufficient statistical power for differential methylation calls and allowed for a maximal number of CpG sites to be analyzed, similar to analysis carried out by others (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Akalin et al., 2012</xref>). We were able to establish the DNA methylation state for 7,492,706 Cytosine positions, including 1,519,053 Cytosine positions from CpG dinucleotides at CpG<sub>10</sub> across all four mouse liver samples. DNA methylation levels of the different genomic elements were computed as a mean of percentages of DNA methylation levels for all CpG dinucleotides, for which data were available in these regions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methylation Comparison and Statistical Analysis</title><p>Percent methylation values for CpG dinucleotides were calculated by dividing the number of methylated Cs by sequencing depth on that base. For representation as a histogram, percentages were grouped within a 10-percentile range from 0 to 100% methylation. The methylation score for each of CpG dinucleotides that were covered by at least 10 reads in all samples (Mixed-1, Mixed-2, B6-1, and B6-2) was determined and then we used Pearson correlation distance and Ward&#x02019;s agglomeration method to determine how similar methylation levels were for each CpG across these samples. Hierarchical clustering of the four samples was performed using the hclust function in R-3.2.1<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn01">1</xref></sup>. Locally weighted polynomial regression (Lowess) was performed in methylation status scatterplots between each two samples to check their relationships. RRBS datasets for zebrafish brain (GSE59916), liver (GSM1456413; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Chatterjee et al., 2014</xref>), and mouse brain (GSM1069659) were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was adopted for testing the methylation pattern difference between mouse and zebrafish. The mouse in the brain study is the C57BL/6 strain, brain tissue was collected at 11 weeks. The zebrafish liver methylome was a pool of five male and five female liver harvested from adult fish and the zebrafish brain methylome was from a pool of two males and two females (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Chatterjee et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To annotate the genomic feature associate with each CpG<sub>10</sub> site, both gene information (promoter, exon, intron, and intergenic) and the list of CpG islands were retrieved from UCSC table browser<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn02">2</xref></sup>. Specific loci were visualized using the epigenome browser<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn03">3</xref></sup> (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). CpG shores were defined as 2,000 bp flanking regions on both upstream and downstream of given CpG islands (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Irizarry et al., 2009</xref>). Regions &#x0003e;2 kb away from CpG islands are defined as &#x0201c;open sea.&#x0201d; If a CpG shore overlapped with another island, the shores were trucked. If multiple shores were overlapping, they were merged into a single shore. Based on refseq annotation, CpG dinucleotides were classified into promoter, intron, exon, and intergenic regions. The statistical test used for the distribution of different genetic elements was Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. TSS regions were defined as the 2,000 bp window centered on the transcript start site (TSS) of genes. In practice, the length of TSS regions is not equal. For global viewing, we calculated the average methylation status (mCpG/CpG) and CpG density within each subset of TSS regions and divided into 40 bins equally in the TSS plot.</p></sec><sec><title>Integration of DNA Methylation and Gene Expression</title><p>Each CpG<sub>10</sub> site was categorized by its methylation status as hypomethylated (&#x0003c;20% of reads are methylated) or hypermethylated (&#x0003e;80% of reads were methylated). We displayed the relative expression of genes with methylated and unmethylated CpGs overlapping with promoter regions and gene bodies in according to two common definitions: 5 kb upstream of the TSS and the &#x000b1;2 kb of the TSS which includes CpGs in gene bodies. Within each region, all methylated and unmethylated CpG were counted to generate methylated and unmethylated gene lists. Then, genes were ranked based on the number of CpG sites. Gene expression was represented by FPKM values and FPKM values were log transformed to display in the heat map.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Mouse Liver Methylome Mapped by ERRBS</title><p>Many studies in mice and humans have described widespread methylome differences in the same organ under different physiological and pathological states (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bird, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Spiers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). To determine whether differences between background strains or housing conditions altered the hepatic methylome, we compared ERRBS datasets from two male mice on a mixed background (mixed-1, mixed-2) and two males on a pure Black-6 (B6-1, B62) background. Mice from different strains were housed in vivariums at different institutions.

Given that most promoters are not methylated (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A,B</xref></bold>), it is difficult to envision how methylation could be a fundamental mechanism that regulates gene expression, except in cases that depart from this pattern and have high methylation levels across their promoters. To examine this further, we counted the number of CpG<sub>10</sub> within -5 kb upstream of the TSS and &#x000b1;2 kb TSS regions that were either methylated (&#x0003e;80% of reads methylated) or unmethylated (&#x0003c;20% of reads as methylated), and those with the highest number of methylated CpG<sub>10</sub> were counted as &#x0201c;hypermethylated&#x0201d; genes and those with the highest number of unmethylated CpG<sub>10</sub> were counted as &#x0201c;hypomethylated&#x0201d; genes (Supplementary Table 1). Genes with no CpGs were excluded. In both gene lists, we found CpGs are enriched in the TSS regions, but methylation status is different. Examples of genes in both categories are shown in <bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3</xref></bold>. We noted that there are far fewer CpGs in genes categorized as hypermethylated compared to hypomethylated genes (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). This indicates that regions with lower CpG content are higher methylated than those with more CpGs, consistent with the finding of others (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We carried out RNAseq analysis on samples from the Mix-1 and Mix-2 livers used for ERRBS as well as of a third sample from a third male mouse from the same background and queried the expression of genes annotated as high and low methylated. We showed the top 100 genes from the methylated and unmethylated gene lists of -5 kb upstream of the TSS in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref></bold>. To include CpG methylation information in gene bodies, we also count methylated and unmethylated genes based on &#x000b1;2 kb TSS regions (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S4</xref></bold>). Overall, we found in both categories there are more genes in the unmethylated list that are expressed at higher levels than those in the methylated category (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S4</xref></bold>) However, there are numerous exceptions, as many of the genes categorized as methylated were expressed at high levels, and vise versa, many of the genes which had very low methylation level were expressed also at relative low levels. Together, these data are consistent with findings across a range of species where there is a modest trend in the correlation between promoter methylation and gene expression, but clearly shows that methylation is neither necessary nor sufficient to suppress expression of many genes in the mouse liver.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>FIGURE 8</label><caption><p><bold>More hypermethylated genes are expressed at lower levels than hypomethylated genes.</bold> Top 100 genes ranked in hypermethylated (&#x0003e;80%) and hypomethylated (&#x0003c;20%) gene list were plotted with expression values.

Although a significant number of non-CpG loci can also be detected by RRBS, the overlap between RRBS and whole genome bisulfite sequencing is much greater for CpG loci than non-CpG loci. A study on human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) by whole genome sequencing detected 830,000 CpG sites (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Ziller et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, whole genome bisulfite sequencing across human cell types detected 250,000 non-CpG loci while RRBS detected 213,000 non-CpG loci with an overlap of 52,000 loci (&#x0003c;25%; <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Ziller et al., 2011</xref>). These observations support the use of RRBS as an excellent method for measuring CpG methylation.</p><p>This being said, RRBS has limited coverage of intergenic regions and CpGi shores, which are important genomic features. ERRBS is enhanced RRBS, which has been used to resolve DNA methylation patterns in human and other animals (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2015</xref>). It is an optimized RRBS by two ways: (1) biochemically, fragments size selection is optimized to capture more CpG sites by the combination of two enzymes, Taq&#x003b1;I and MspI, and (2) bioinformatically, alignment algorithm is optimized to increase mapping efficiency (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Akalin et al., 2012</xref>). When compared to RRBS, ERRBS resulted in a higher number of CpGs represented in the data generated and increased coverage of all genomic regions interrogated (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). So examining regions of the genome not covered by this method could potentially yield a new perspective on the comparative methylome. A caveat to all bisulfite based methylome approaches is the end is the inability to discriminate between 5mC and 5hmC, however, given that 5hmC represents only a small fraction of all methylated CpGs, this is more of a concern when the direct role of specific CpGs is under investigation. Additional consideration for the ERRBS and RRBS datasets is that the distribution of mapped reads is not entirely random. However, considering the considerable advantage in sequencing depth compared to whole genome bisulfite sequencing, (E)RRBS allows analysis of CpGs methylation in each major genomic element and provides an excellent approach for comparative analysis of the methylome landscape.</p><p>The current study is among the first comparisons of the methylome from the same tissue of mouse and zebrafish. A previous study focusing on NMI distribution and function among several vertebrates, including mouse and zebrafish, identified more NMIs that were shared between liver and testis in zebrafish compared to mouse (18854 vs. 16680, respectively), and an expanded number of unique NMIs in the zebrafish liver compared to those that were unique to zebrafish testis (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Long et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, many genes marked as unique NMIs in testis or liver were differentially expressed in these two tissues in mouse, human chicken and platypus samples (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Long et al., 2013</xref>). Another study comparing the methylation profile of whole zebrafish and mouse embryos found very high levels of CpG methylation in both (74% in zebrafish and 80% in mouse; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2010</xref>) and showed a similar pattern of methylated CpGs across gene bodies, repeats and TEs (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2010</xref>). The differences between our findings of greatly divergent methylation levels between the mouse and fish hepatic and brain methylomes could be attributed to a difference in tissue studied, as the mouse embryo may have more CpG methylation than a differentiated tissue, or in the method used to interrogate the methylome. Indeed, a comparison between the methylation patterns in the whole early zebrafish embryo to that of adult differentiated muscle revealed that about 70% of CpGs were hypermethylated in muscle, a slightly lower level than observed in pre-gastrula embryos at the sphere and 256 cell stage (&#x0003e;90%; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Potok et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bogdanovi&#x00107; et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, our finding that CpG methylation in zebrafish liver and brain has ranges from 63 to 69% demonstrates that the zebrafish genome during both embryonic development and in differentiated tissues is highly methylated.</p><p>A second observation from our work is that the zebrafish genome has a much higher level of CpG methylation compared to the mouse genome. This is probably attributed to an increased prevalence of intergenic regions in zebrafish than that in mouse, as annotated intergenic regions tend to be enriched for methylated CpGs in both mouse and zebrafish (see <bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref></bold> and <bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref></bold>). This observation is also in line with the presence of more TEs in intergenic regions, in the zebrafish genome than that in the mouse genome (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Kapusta et al., 2013</xref>). Considering the genome size and repeat sequence proportion individually, TEs comprise 51.8% of the zebrafish genome and 45.3% in the mouse genome (<bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref></bold>). The finding that the fraction of the genome occupied by TEs is higher in zebrafish can be attributed to the huge amplification of DNA transposons in zebrafish. In fact, the zebrafish is the only vertebrate studied which displays such a dramatic and recent amplification of TEs (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chalopin et al., 2015</xref>). It is likely that the zebrafish genome is loaded with potentially active elements, (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Lam et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Hagemann and Hammer, 2006</xref>) which can rapidly amplify their population across the genome and DNA methylation serves as a primary mechanism to silence these. We propose that the high level of DNA methylation in zebrafish is a consequence of this TE-enriched genome and CpG islands, as a mechanism of limiting transposition. Indeed, we find that most of the methylated CpGs in the intragenic region map to the TEs in zebrafish (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref></bold>). In contrast, the mouse genome is dominated by L1 and SINEs, which are also active but most of the progenitors have accumulated inactivating mutations (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Kapusta et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, it is very likely that the difference in methylation results from the different evolutionary dynamics of TEs in these two genomes (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chalopin et al., 2015</xref>). These findings underscore the concept that the major role for DNA methylation is not only to play prominent role of DNA methylation in regulating gene expression, but also repress expression of repetitive sequences.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>CZ fulfilled major work of this study, including data analysis, making figure and writing manuscript.
