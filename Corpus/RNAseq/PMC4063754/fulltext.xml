Certain biological phenomena, such as X chromosome inactivation and parental imprinting, affect ASE most drastically by completely shutting down the expression of a whole set of alleles. Other more subtle effects on ASE are likely to be much more complex and dependent on the genetic environment and are perhaps more important to understand since they may be responsible for a significant amount of biological diversity. Tools to assess ASE in a diploid biological system are becoming more reliable. Non-diploid systems are, however, not uncommon. In humans full or partial polyploid states are regularly found in both healthy (meiotic cells, polynucleated cell types) and diseased tissues (trisomies, non-disjunction events, cancerous tissues). In this work we have studied ASE in the medaka fish model system. We have developed a method for determining ASE in polyploid organisms from RNAseq data and we have implemented this method in a software tool set. As a biological model system we have used nuclear transplantation to experimentally produce artificial triploid medaka composed of three different haplomes. We measured ASE in RNA isolated from the livers of two adult, triploid medaka fish that showed a high degree of similarity. The majority of genes examined (82%) shared expression more or less evenly among the three alleles in both triploids. The rest of the genes (18%) displayed a wide range of ASE levels. Interestingly the majority of genes (78%) displayed generally consistent ASE levels in both triploid individuals. A large contingent of these genes had the same allele entirely suppressed in both triploids. When viewed in a chromosomal context, it is revealed that these genes are from large sections of 4 chromosomes and may be indicative of some broad scale suppression of gene expression.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding was provided partly by the NIH, ORIP, Division of Comparative Medicine (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dpcpsi.nih.gov/orip/CM/index">http://dpcpsi.nih.gov/orip/CM/index</ext-link>) grants R24-OD-011120 and R24-OD-011199.

Among plants in general, and particularly in many food crops, polyploidy also plays a major role in enhancing phenotypic variation and is often associated with increased vigor and the gain of desirable traits <xref rid="pone.0100250-Doyle1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In plants made polyploid through hybridization, homoeologous genes (ancestrally homologous genes incorporated in an allopolyploid organism) can have uneven allele specific expression levels or overall gene expression levels that differ greatly from the parents <xref rid="pone.0100250-Yoo1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. These homoeologous genes bring together their accompanying regulatory elements which interact with the rest of the regulatory machinery upon hybridization to unevenly affect allele expression and may lead to extensively altered phenotypes <xref rid="pone.0100250-Madlung1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In order to understand the impact of allopolyploidization on a molecular genetic level, it will be necessary to study ASE on a genome-wide scale.</p><p>In addition to better understanding of plants important to our food supply, understanding ASE in polyploid states is important to human health. In many cases cancerous cells contain multiple extra chromosomes leading to partial or full polyploidy <xref rid="pone.0100250-Beroukhim1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Nondisjunction events also result in partially duplicated chromosomes and are mostly incompatible with life in humans, but in other cases lead to large phenotypic disruptions <xref rid="pone.0100250-McFadden1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. All of these situations are related to the more basic question of how ASE is affected by the elevation of a diploid genome to a polyploid state.</p><p>In such a situation it may be that alleles of each gene are expressed at the same levels in the polyploid environment as in the diploid such that the total gene expression is greater than that of a parent. Alternately there could be some form of dosage compensation such as silencing of individual alleles or of an entire haplome (genetically distinct set of chromosomes). There may be a bias for one haplome, or it could be random. In order to sufficiently answer these questions it is necessary to study the whole genome where all alleles can be distinguished, but this has proven to be problematic. It is a problem common to many polyploid biological systems and has been faced before largely in plant studies but also some animals <xref rid="pone.0100250-Madlung1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0100250-Mochida1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Several studies have addressed the basic issue of ASE in polyploid systems in plants, and a recent review provides an excellent summary of these findings <xref rid="pone.0100250-Madlung1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In general a wide array of expression patterns have been observed in hybrid systems <xref rid="pone.0100250-Madlung1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100250-Adams1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100250-Mochida1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In some cases expression from each allele may be additive. For other genes, however, the expression is dominated by one allele. These effects may be tissue-specific, responsive to environmental cues, or they may be biased toward one parent. In general these observations have been made on small gene sets. High throughput studies include some use of microarrays <xref rid="pone.0100250-Rapp1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100250-Incio1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and a recent analysis of allopolyploid (AD) cotton using RNAseq <xref rid="pone.0100250-Yoo1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Examples of polyploid animals are rare especially among vertebrates, but several examples exist among amphibians and teleost fish. An especially notable example is that of the <italic>Squalius alburnoides</italic> complex. This is a naturally occurring inter-generic hybrid population descended from <italic>Squalius pyrenaicus</italic> females and males of an extinct species in which individuals may contain between 2&#x02013;4 genome copies <xref rid="pone.0100250-Pala1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100250-Pala2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. A mechanism of dosage compensation is employed by this fish is the silencing of specific alleles, but not of an entire haplome <xref rid="pone.0100250-Pala1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>The ability to measure ASE in these situations is vital to better understand global mechanisms of allele dosage compensation and to disentangle gene interaction networks. Thus, we have generated a model in which three haploid genomes with sufficient genetic diversity to allow determination of allele specific gene expression were combined to experimentally produce triploids. We used the small laboratory fish medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>) to produce two triploid individuals through nuclear transfer of a diploid F<sub>1</sub> nucleus to a recipient ovum, thus incorporating haplomes from three disparate medaka strains. We then developed a computational methodology to derive allele-specific expression values from RNAseq data obtained from isolated liver RNA from the triploid and parental diploid fish. In the triploid medaka, we find that alleles are expressed at similar levels in most cases, but allele suppression is not uncommon and occurs consistently in the two triploid fish. In some cases, the suppressed alleles are completely silenced and in these cases the silenced allele is almost never derived from the maternal genome component stemming from the mother of the F<sub>1</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>In order to produce artificial triploid fish, diploid hybrid F<sub>1</sub> embryos were first produced through the natural mating of two genetically different strains (the Houiken Niigata-II, or HNI-II, strain originates from a wild population in northern Japan and the Sokcho, or SOK, strain originates from a wild population in east Korea). Then diploid hybrid nuclei from the developing embryonic blastomeres were transplanted into unfertilized eggs of a third medaka strain (the orange-red or OR strain is derived from a commercially available variety originated from a southern Japanese wild population). The resulting triploid embryos have three genetically distinct sets of chromosomes (haplomes). Through this technique two triploid fish were produced for this study (from now on referred to as trpA and trpB) that incorporated genetic material from three divergent strains of medaka (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100250-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Both individuals were phenotypically female, and developed as apparently healthy adults, but were infertile.</p><fig id="pone-0100250-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0100250.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Parent strains and variant calling.</title><p>(A) Parent strains and gender of donor genomes (images provided by MS).

In diploid organisms SNPs can be used to discriminate expression levels of two alleles, but in the triploid case it is uncommon for a single SNP position to discriminate all three alleles. Instead we identified SNPs that were found to have only one possible nucleotide in one strain that did not overlap with the observed nucleotide possibilities in the other two strains at the same position in the same transcript.</p><p>Short read data for the three parental strains were aligned using the STAR aligner <xref rid="pone.0100250-Dobin1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://code.google.com/p/rna-star/">https://code.google.com/p/rna-star/</ext-link>). The STAR aligner was utilized since it is fast and can accurately handle several mismatches, indels and/or splice junctions. Since the reference sequences were transcripts, the ability to align over splice junctions was disabled, but alignment over short indels was still allowed. Short read samples had between of 54 to 61% of the reads alignedalign (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0100250-t001">Table 1</xref>). The reference sequences in ENSMBL arewere largely based on high throughput sequencing of the Hd-rR strain of medaka which, like the OR strain, also originates from the southern Japanese population. This was further supplemented with data from the HNI strain that is similar to the HNI-II strain and also originates from northern Japan. Therefore it is nottherefore surprisingsurprise these two strains had the most reads aligned and fewest dSNPs and indels detected. The SOK strain, originating from south Korea has the fewest reads aligned and most dSNPs and indels. Even so, using the STAR short read aligner that can work around mismatches and indels, the number of SOK reads aligned is not drastically different from the number of OR and HNI-II reads aligned (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0100250-t001">Table 1</xref>). We detected 9,913 putative indels throughout the full set of transcripts.

During our filtration process it is possible some reads lose their mate while in cases where the reads overlap significantly, they are merged into one read. Therefore it is more useful to use the term fragments (the sum of pairs and single reads) as opposed to reads or pairs.

These positions however included many that did not provide useful information for the following reasons: one or more strains are heterozygous such that none can be completely distinguished from the other two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100250-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, position 47), the coverage in one strain is too low to make a confident call of observed sequence (annotated by VarScan as an N; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100250-g001">Figure 1B</xref> position 998), or all three strains agree with one another but disagree with the reference. Excluding these cases left 109,581 informational sites which can distinguish the expression of one allele from the other two. For the sake of brevity, and convenience, we call these sites discriminatory SNPs (dSNPs) throughout this report. In order to measure ASE values for all three alleles in a gene, the dSNP number was further reduced to a final total of 83,173 dSNPs that occurred in transcripts containing at least one dSNP representative of each parental strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100250-g001">Figure 1B</xref> discriminatory SNPs). The reference sequences we used were primarily based on data from the OR strain, and thus this strain had the fewest dSNPs detected.</p><p>Another departure from normal diploid determination of ASE is that each parental strain had a different set of dSNPs that distinguish it, and therefore we cannot simply count the reads attributable to each parental haplome. This is largely due to the wide variability in the number of dSNPs for each parental strain for some transcripts. For example, in a given reference transcript one haplome may be represented by only 1 or 2 dSNPs while another may have 20; this situation would bias read counts toward the haplome having 20 dSNPs. A second reason for not performing standard read counting is the large variability in coverage depth possible over the length of a transcript. Each dSNP can only sample the expression signal from one haplome at one position along the transcript. Thus, it may be misleading should the position of the dSNP coincide with a very low or very high depth of coverage for a given transcript.</p><p>Our strategy was to use the depth of coverage information at dSNP positions to identify the fraction of that coverage depth that was attributable to the haplome for which each dSNP was specific. Then the coverage fractions attributable to each haplome were integrated to give a single ASE value for that haplome. In order to derive ASE values from these single positions, fractional expression values are combined from dSNPs in the same gene. We were therefore constrained to the 4,282 transcripts (of 24,662 annotated in ENSEMBL version 65) that had at least one dSNP representative of each of the three haplomes. The final set of 83,173 dSNPs are present in these 4,282 transcripts resulting in an average of 19.4 dSNPs per transcript.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Determination of ASE from Normalized Coverage Depth</title><p>Short reads aligned to a reference transcriptome generally result in uneven depth of coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100250-g002">Figure 2A</xref> raw coverage). Many factors may contribute to this phenomenon and it is commonly observed in all RNAseq data. For example the expression of alternative splice forms, where two expressed splice forms may provide the common exons and thus more reads in an additive fashion, while differently incorporated exons would only be expressed at the level of each splice form. Additionally, annotated genes often include only some of the splice forms or possible exons that actually make up a locus thus making an accurate measure of gene expression more difficult. Another factor that may affect coverage variability in some transcripts stems from the inability of short read aligners to distinguish between equally good alignment locations. Some subsequences of the reference can be very common and thus give the short read aligner a difficult choice. In these situations it is common to simply not report alignments to these regions, to randomly select one, or to report alignments to all regions. Thus, choices made in these areas can result in more or less reads aligned to them. To circumvent this problem in our analyses we chose to assess the fractional expression at dSNP sites in each transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100250-g002">Figure 2A</xref> fractional expression at dSNPs). Herein the fractional expression values were multiplied by the geometric mean of coverage depth of the transcript in which they occur in order to obtain an allele specific expression value for each dSNP position. We chose the geometric mean of coverage depth as a measure of gene expression in order to mitigate the effects of transcript length and lessen the bias in apparent expression value due to spikes in coverage.

We generated an artificial set of short read data from the full set of medaka transcripts. To generate these synthetic reads, we produced a strain-specific set of transcript sequences wherein the strain-specific SNP nucleotides were substituted into the reference sequence. The total number of reads generated for each transcript was the same as that found by mapping short reads from trpA to the reference sequences, and we kept the allele balances consistent with those measured in trpA. For 91% of the transcripts in this data set (3,891 out of 4,282), we obtained a correlation of greater than 0.8 when comparing measured to actual allele expression values, with the bulk of these (3,684, 86%) having a correlation coefficient of 0.90 or greater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100250-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>We ruled out several factors that were speculated to adversely affect the analysis in these 9% of cases including overall expression, numbers of dSNPs per transcript, and frequently found sub-sequences.

The randomness of generated reads likely had a role in the poor correlation of some transcripts in cases where the three alleles had known values very close to one another. Presume for example the known values were 255, 260, and 265 for the three alleles. These quantities of reads would have been generated from random locations along the length of the strain-specific references to represent each allele. Some noise therefore is introduced and the reconstructed ASE values may have been 11, 12, and 11.

We are interested in dividing genes into groups that may be differentially expressed in the triploid environment from those that seem to be expressed at similar levels to the average of parental expression. To this end we select a threshold of 2-fold change either up or down in gene expression for each triploid with respect to the average parental gene expression. The coefficient of variation (c<sub>v</sub>) is used here as a normalized measure of dispersion of the allele specific expression values. A low c<sub>v</sub> indicates the three alleles for a given gene have relatively equal expression to one another. As the c<sub>v</sub> rises the expression of the three alleles becomes more divergent. The highest possible c<sub>v</sub> is 1.73 which corresponds to the condition where one allele shows some expression while the other two alleles are totally shut down. The data indicate a significant clustering of genes have a c<sub>v</sub> of &#x0223c;0.86. This corresponds to the situation in which one allele is not expressed (zero or near-zero expression levels) while the other two alleles make up the bulk of expression. We use this as a second arbitrary threshold to divide our data. These boundaries are shown in four quadrants of plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100250-g005">Figure 5</xref> A and B. Quadrant 0 represents transcripts in which ASE values are relatively equal to one another and in which the overall gene expression is similar to that of the parental strains (3,166 transcripts in trpA and 3,415 transcripts in trpB with 2,918 shared between them).

The vertical axis of (A) indicates the coefficient of variation (c<sub>v</sub>) of ASE values for each transcript in trpA, while (B) indicates the same quantity for trpB. c<sub>v</sub> values near 0 indicate that the three alleles are expressed at near equal levels, and increasing c<sub>v</sub> values indicate a greater dispersion of allele-specific expression.

This resulted in 1,593 transcripts in trpA and 1,447 transcripts in trpB for which the resultant p-value was less than 0.01. These sets of transcripts which deviate from equal allele expression were then broken down into groups indicative of exceptionally high or low expression of one allele.</p><p>In order to identify high or low expressing alleles, we chose to use the median of allele expression in each transcript as a basis for comparison since it is more resistant to outliers than the median.

We selected an arbitrary boundary of 2-fold above or below the median as a threshold for selection as a high or low expressing allele. Six separate categories indicate one of each of the three alleles were expressed at 2-fold above, or below the median expression of the three alleles in a given gene (these categories are: HNI Up, HNI Down, OR Up, OR Down, SOK Up, and SOK Down).

In fact 3,353 transcripts are in the same category in both triploids.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Allele-specific Suppression is a Common Feature</title><p>Overall, most genes seem to be expressed at similar total levels in triploid fish as those in the parental strains. In the case of an imbalance the data suggest it is more common for one allele to be suppressed than it is for one allele to dominate expression of the gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100250-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0100250.s002">Figure S2</xref>). A similar feature in which certain genes are effectively diploidized has been observed in triploid individuals of the naturally occurring intergenic hybrid <italic>S. alburnoides</italic> complex <xref rid="pone.0100250-Pala1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100250-Pala2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100250-Matos1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. There does not seem to be a global preference for any given allele in transcripts based on either differential gene expression or allele specific gene expression. On the other hand, in both triploids, a majority of transcripts wherein one allele has been suppressed to expression levels at or near zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100250-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0100250.s002">Figure S2</xref> coefficient of variation near 0.87) are in only two categories: HNI down and OR down (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0100250.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Whatever mechanism is active in this regulation, it appears as though it has a bias for the donor female-derived haplome. In both triploids the male-derived haplome (HNI-II) is the most drastically suppressed and it is followed by the haplome of the recipient ovum (SOK). On the contrary, the donor female-derived haplome (OR) was nearly unaffected by drastic allele suppression. This could be reflective of some form of allele suppression that favors the donor maternal genome. This may be somehow associated with the different packing states of the chromatin since the diploid nucleus taken from the blastula cell had been in an active state whereas the chromatin of the recipient ovum may have still been in a more dormant and packed form. Thus it may be that the donor female haplome was able to impose some allele silencing regime on the male haplome and the recipient female haplome.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>ASE Imbalances are Similar between Triploid Fish</title><p>ASE analysis of two experimentally produced medaka triploids shows a consistent pattern of allele-specific gene regulation between the two triploid individuals. Of the 4,282 transcripts in our analysis, 3,353 are in the same ASE imbalance categories in both triploid fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100250-g006">Figure 6</xref>). This implies common regulatory mechanism(s) may direct ASE in both fish. This is surprising since polyploidy is not commonly found in medaka populations, thus there is no expectation for the existence of selective pressures to develop a regulatory mechanism that would act consistently on ASE in the medaka genome in a polyploid state. In some cases in plants particular crosses have predictable patterns of ASE dominance/suppression <xref rid="pone.0100250-Doyle1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and in <italic>S. alburnoides</italic> the pattern of suppression is different between, yet consistent within, geographical populations <xref rid="pone.0100250-Pala2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In both of these cases, however, the similarities are due to preferential suppression of one whole haplome whereas we do not see evidence of this in the medaka triploids.</p><p>Some chromosomes have large regions in which one allele is predominantly affected in a similar manner. Specifically, chromosomes 6, 7, 9 and 19 each have large regions in which most of the allelic imbalances observed resulted from suppression of the HNI allele in both triploid fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100250-g006">Figure 6</xref>). We explored the possibility the four chromosomes might have been related through duplication in the teleost-specific whole genome duplication event <xref rid="pone.0100250-Santini1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. However, according to a recent analysis, these chromosomes are thought to have originated from separate ancestral chromosomes <xref rid="pone.0100250-Kasahara1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, so it is unlikely that they have a common set of ancestral regulatory regions. One possible explanation is that the triploid fish are genetically very similar and so the possible regulatory schemes are likely limited. The three parental strains are genetically very homogeneous due to the closed colony breeding in which genetic bottlenecks also occur. Additionally these artificial triploid fish could share a common parentage. Donor blastula cells and host ova were pooled during the nuclear transfer proceedure and it is possible the donor nuclei for both triploids were derived from sister blastula cells leading to a very similar set of genetic material from both HNI-II and SOK strains.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Improvements Could Expand the Available Gene Set</title><p>In the current study we limited ourselves to producing ASE values for transcripts in which each allele was represented by at least one SNP. We were thus limited to a set of 4,282 transcripts out of 24,662 possible transcripts representing 4,181 of 19,687 genes that were annotated in the medaka genome (ENSEMBL version 65). One way it may be possible to expand the data set is to incorporate cases where one allele lacks dSNPs. In this case the ASE value of the remaining allele can be extrapolated from the calculated values of the two alleles with dSNPs. Doing this would expand the number of transcripts in our analysis by 1,728 or 40%.</p><p>One of the limitations on the number of transcripts amenable to ASE analysis was the variant calling step. We set very conservative thresholds when calling consensus sequences using VarScan, which likely precluded many lowly expressed transcripts from inclusion into our analysis. It is likely that many more variants could be reliably identified using an approach that specifically targets the genome and provides more even coverage, such as exome sequencing <xref rid="pone.0100250-Meynert1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. With a more robust and complete set of SNPs, it should be possible to significantly increase the number of genes in the analysis.</p><p>Another limitation of our method is that RNA-seq reads from three divergent strains were aligned to one common reference. This may cause a bias in relative expression levels since too many sequence differences occuring near one another may be a barrier to read alignment for those that do not originate from the same species or strain as the reference <xref rid="pone.0100250-Stevenson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. We ultimately used the STAR aligner which is permissive and can accurately align short reads over mismatches and indels and this aligner proved capable of greatly increasing the number of dSNPs able to used compared with others we employed (i.e., Bowtie).use. Additionally using the STAR aligner we found the balance of overall allele expression to be nearly equal (Figure S3) with only slight biases remaining against the most distant medaka strain. A more accurate yet more restrictive procedure is outlined in a recent report by Stevenson et. al. where only sites without such clusters of sequence variants are considered for ASE <xref rid="pone.0100250-Stevenson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>In summary, this complex data set has revealed several interesting biological features of the molecular-genetic activities of experimentally produced triploid medaka. The data made available by RNAseq based polyploid ASE analysis provide a highly detailed basis for the future analysis of genetic regulatory networks. This was enabled by the method we describe here for determining allele-specific expression in polyploid organisms on a large scale. Much of the software developed was created in such a way as to accommodate any ploidy number so as to be applicable to the more common diploid and/or the rare/exceptional higher-ploidy organisms with little modification. We expect this will expand our ability to understand the importance of ASE in other biologically and medically interesting systems.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement Regarding Animal Subjects</title><p>The research presented here complies with the applicable EU and national German legislation governing animal experimentation, especially the Tierschutzgesetz der Bundesrepublik Deutschland (German Federal Law of Animal Protection).

The resultant short reads were filtered for quality using a custom filtration pipeline. In general, steps include removing adapter sequence, trimming away low quality regions, and merging overlapping reads. Less than 5% of reads were lost during filtration and the parental strain short read libraries each consisted of approximately 64 million reads, while each of the triploid fish libraries consisted of around 200 million reads (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0100250-t001">Table 1</xref>). Short read libraries have been deposited in the sequence read archive (SRA) under BioProject accession: PRJNA246137 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>SNP Calling</title><p>Reads from each of the three parental strains were separately aligned to the reference transcript sequences (Medaka cDNA &#x02018;all&#x02019; not &#x02018;<italic>ab initio</italic>&#x02019; records from ENSEMBL v 65) using STAR version 2.3.0e (linux 64-bit pre-compiled binary) <xref rid="pone.0100250-Dobin1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> to produce output files in the SAM format which were converted to sorted BAM files using samtools (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0100250.s006">Protocol S1</xref>). Each sample was aligned separately to produce three output files in total. These files were then converted to BAM format, sorted, and finally converted to mpileup format using samtools version 0.1.18 <xref rid="pone.0100250-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.

We selected conservative constraints such that a position must have an overall coverage depth of 15x to be considered at all. Reads must have an read quality of 25 or more at the position of the variant to be considered. In order to call a variant, it must be supported by 20% of the reads that cover it and in lower coverage cases a minimum of 5 reads must support it. These two settings specifically should serve to minimize the likelihood of erroneous calls from sequencing errors. Further, a p-value (calculated via Fisher&#x02019;s Exact Test and indicates the likelihood of the call) must be below 0.01. Lastly a strand filter is applied to help identify variants that could be the result of PCR over-amplification.

In order for a position to be considered different in one strain, that strain had to be homozygous for the difference, and the observed nucleotides in the other strains had to be supported by the same constraints as were described in the SNP calling section above. The discriminatory SNPs (dSNPs) were then annotated with Ensembl transcript and gene IDs and grouped by transcript.

The first step involves normalizing to control for sample size variations and scaling coverage. The first step appropriately scales overall transcript expression values to enable comparisons between samples. In the second step the values of discriminating SNPs are integrated to estimate the contribution of each genome to the overall expression of a given gene.</p><p>Short reads from triploid samples were mapped using the STAR aligner, and the resulting SAM output was converted to mpileup format as previously described (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0100250.s006">Protocol S1</xref>). Then a perl script was used to extract the depth of coverage for each position in the reference sequences in each sample, and calculate the geometric mean of the depth of coverage for each transcript as a measure of the expression value. Only positions for which the coverage depth is greater than 0 are considered, therefore we define the covered length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0100250.e001.jpg"/></inline-formula> to be the subset of positions in the transcript that have a coverage depth of 1 or greater. The geometric mean of the coverage depth over each transcript (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0100250.e002.jpg"/></inline-formula>) with covered length (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0100250.e003.jpg"/></inline-formula>) and coverage depth at each position (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0100250.e004.jpg"/></inline-formula>) is described below.<disp-formula id="pone.0100250.e005"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0100250.e005.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>We then use the geometric mean of coverage depth in a transcript as a measure of transcript expression.</p><p>Because the amount of data generated varies by sequencing lane and sample, we next normalized the data to control for variations in overall sample size. Briefly, the geometric mean of each transcript expression value across samples is taken as a representative transcript expression value. Then the transcript expression values in each sample are divided by their associated representative expression values. The median of these quotients in a given sample is then taken as the size factor with which to adjust each individual transcript expression value in that sample. This method is the same as is described by the authors of the DESeq package <xref rid="pone.0100250-Anders1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> with the exception that instead of total read counts here we use the geometric mean of read depth as our transcript expression value.</p><p>Next the fractional expression is measured at dSNP sites.

The selection of these transcripts was based on the allelic expression patterns observed in the tri-hybrids. The selected targets are representative of different extreme possibilities of allelic usage in this &#x0201c;three allelic&#x0201d; context (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0100250.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Specific primers for each of these transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0100250.s003">Table S1</xref>) were designed based on the sequences alignment of the three alleles (OR, HNI-I, SOK) with Bioedit v7.2.0.</p><p>From an aliquot of each RNA sample, first-strand cDNA was synthesized with RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas). Amplification of each target transcript was performed for each sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0100250.s003">Table S1</xref>) according to the following PCR conditions: pre-heating at 95&#x000b0;C for 5 min, 35 cycles at 95&#x000b0;C for 30 s, 55&#x000b0;C or 57&#x000b0;C for 30 s and 72&#x000b0;C for 45 s and a final extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min. The PCR products were Sanger sequenced and the sequences analyzed (Sequencher ver. 4.0, Gene Codes Corporation, Inc.) in order to validate the SNP calling between the three parental lines and the presence of expression derived from any single allele, any two, or all three alleles in the tri-hybrids.</p></sec><sec id="s4k"><title>Synthetic Data Set</title><p>The synthetic data were generated to match the calculated ASE values of trpA. The total number of reads generated per transcript were the same as found by aligning short reads from trpA to the reference. The fraction derived from each strain was determined by multiplying this total, by the fraction of total expression attributed to each strain. For example, if for a given transcript, the ASE values of HNI-II, OR, and SOK were 10, 20, and 30 respectively and the total number of fragments aligned to that transcript were 500, then the number of reads generated for HNI-II, OR, and SOK variants would be <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0100250.e016.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0100250.e017.jpg"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0100250.e018.jpg"/></inline-formula> respectively. In order to generate the fragments contributed by each strain we created strain-specific reference sequences with the strain-specific SNPs substituted in to the reference transcript sequence. Then the required number of fragments were generated as paired 100 bp reads with a fragment size of 250 bp taken at randomized start positions along the transcript length. This short read data set was then analyzed using the same software pipeline.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0100250.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>Genes selected for dSNP confirmation.</bold> Genes selected for confirmation of dSNPs were taken from all 4 quadrants and are shown here as red circles overlaid on a background of grey points showing the change in gene expression vs. the dispersion of allele specific expression in trpA.
