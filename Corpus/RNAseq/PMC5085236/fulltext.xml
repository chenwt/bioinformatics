Maleimide derivatives such as SB-216763 act as GSK-3 inhibitor targeting cell proliferation, cell death and cell cycle progression.</p><p>Herein, the two arylindolylmaleimide derivatives PDA-66 and PDA-377 were evaluated as potential chemotherapeutic agents on canine B-cell lymphoma cell lines. Canine lymphoma represents a naturally occurring model closely resembling the human high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). PDA-66 showed more pronounced effects on both cell lines. Application of 2.5&#x003bc;M PDA-66 resulted in a significant induction of apoptosis (approx. 11 %), decrease of the metabolic activity (approx. 95 %), anti-proliferative effect (approx. 85 %) and cell death within 48h. Agent induced mode of action was characterized by whole transcriptome sequencing, 12 h and 24 h post-agent exposure. Key PDA-66-modulated pathways identified were cell cycle, DNA replication and p53 signaling. Expression analyses indicated that the drug acting mechanism is mediated through DNA replication and cycle arrest involving the spindle assembly checkpoint.</p><p>In conclusion, both PDA derivatives displayed strong anti-proliferation activity in canine B-cell lymphoma cells. The cell and molecular PDA-induced effect characterization and the molecular characterization of the agent acting mechanism provides the basis for further evaluation of a potential drug for canine lymphoma serving as model for human NHL.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>PDA</kwd><kwd>arylindolylmaleimides</kwd><kwd>canine lymphoma</kwd><kwd>transcriptome sequencing</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Canine lymphoma represent approx. 24 % of all occurring canine neoplasms and 83 % of all canine hematopoietic neoplasms [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Compared to human lymphoma, the canine tumor shows a higher incidence with 13-33 cases per year in 100,000 dogs [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Concerning tumor development, progression and disease pattern lymphoma in dogs presents highly similar to human high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and thus is considered to serve as a comparative animal model of human NHL [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Without treatment, most dogs suffering from malignant lymphoma die within four to six weeks [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In dogs, combination chemotherapy protocols are superior in multicentric lymphoma and conventional CHOP-based chemotherapy induces remission in approx. 80 % to 95 % [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, the majority of dogs undergoing chemotherapy suffer disease recurrence within 12 months. Further, the recurrent lymphoma cells are described to be highly resistant to the initial chemotherapeutic protocol [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Conventional chemotherapeutic protocols are currently being completed by addition of inhibitory agents targeting specific pathways e.g. GSK-3 or PI3K. These pathways are reported to be altered in different neoplasias such as leukemia [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Arylindolylmaleimides are synthetic molecules, consisting of a maleimide group conjugated to a bicyclic indole ring and an additional aromatic or heterocyclic component [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. PDA-66 and PDA-377 are two arylindolylmaleimides representing analogues of the GSK-3-specific inhibitor SB-216763 characterized by differences in their chemical substitutions [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Application of PDA-66 to human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines induced significant anti-proliferative effects leading to apoptosis but did not inhibit GSK-3 significantly at protein level [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Previously, PDA-66 was reported to have a depolymerizing effect on tubulin assembly <italic>in vitro</italic> inducing microtubule destabilization in differentiated human neural progenitor cells [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, the effects of PDA-66 and PDA-377 on lymphoma cells have not been characterized before.</p><p>Aim of this study was to characterize the influence of PDA-66 and PDA-377 on the two canine B-cell lymphoma cell lines CLBL-1 and CLBL-1M at cellular and molecular level. Due to the similarities in presentation and biologic behavior of lymphomas in dogs and humans, therapeutic protocols of these compounds in dogs could bear high transfer potential to the human disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>PDA-66 and PDA-377 inhibit proliferation and metabolic activity of canine B-cell lymphoma cell lines</title><p>PDA-66 demonstrated a strong effect on CLBL-1 and CLBL-1M proliferation.

Different dosages and incubation times were compared to DMSO-treated control cultures. The DMSO concentration (&#x02264; 0.1 %) in the control groups was chosen to be equivalent to the highest DMSO concentration of the PDA group in order to compensate for putative solvent effects. Nevertheless, such low concentrations of DMSO are described to cause no cell toxicity [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Consistent with previous findings, PDA-66 and PDA-377 led to a significant decrease in cell count, metabolic activity, and induced anti-proliferative effects in canine B-cell lymphoma cells. Furthermore, an induction of apoptosis and late apoptotic/dead cells was detected in the exposed lymphoma cells. Compared with PDA-377, PDA-66 showed a stronger cytotoxic effect inducing death of all lymphoma cells after 48 h at a concentration of 2.5 &#x003bc;M. In fact, inhibition to 70 % proliferation and apoptosis of 10 % was observed at 24 h post 2.5 &#x003bc;M PDA-66 application. Although inhibitory effects of 1.0 &#x003bc;M PDA-66 on cell proliferation and metabolic activity were also observed, the cells maintained a comparable growth rate to DMSO-treated control. Previous studies on human ALL cell lines have shown a significant inhibition of proliferation starting at a concentration of 0.5 &#x003bc;M PDA-66 [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In the ReNcell VM human neural progenitor cell line (hNPC), proliferation can be stopped by application of 3 &#x003bc;M PDA-66 while human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 8.48 &#x003bc;M and lung cancer cells (A549) with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 4.97 &#x003bc;M were less sensitive to PDA-66 [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Comparative transcriptome analysis was performed for the more potent compound (PDA-66) at 12 h and 24 h post application of dosages of 1.0 &#x003bc;M and 2.5 &#x003bc;M. Low-dose-treated groups did not show major gene expression differences compared to controls while high-dose application induced distinct effects. Early modulated genes and pathways (12 h PDA-66 high-dose) mapped to three main pathways: cell cycle, DNA replication and p53 signaling pathway. However, the gene sets assigned to the p53 and cell cycle pathway largely overlap. The effect of PDA-66 on cell cycle and DNA replication was more pronounced at 24 h, indicating a time-dependent effect in both cell lines. Minor differences in transcript abundance of ribosomal proteins were detected between the CLBL-1 and CLBL-1M 24 h high-dose groups. The deregulated pathways (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>) showed slightly different levels of significance. These observed subtle differences only seen in the 24 h high dose reaction of the two cell lines could be caused by clonal selection as the cell line CLBL-1M was generated by <italic>in vivo</italic> inoculation of CLBL-1. However, the general response of both cell lines and the major addressed pathways are comparable indicating a common acting mechanism of the compounds.</p><p>Expression analyses showed that especially genes, for which peak transcription is described in late G2/M phase are significantly elevated in the treated cells, while G1 and S-phase-associated genes were significantly depleted (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This observation strongly suggests that PDA-66 induces a cell cycle block, which arrests the cells and ultimately leads to apoptosis. Three cell cycle checkpoints are known in mammalian cells: the G1 checkpoint, the G2-M DNA damage response checkpoint (DDR) and the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Though our RNAseq data clearly excluded an arrest at G1 phase, we detected the transcriptional enrichment of genes related to both DDR and SAC. While the enrichment of TP53I3 (tumor protein p53 inducible protein) transcripts points to an activation of TP53 mediated DDR, the enriched MAD2, CDC20 and BUB1B transcripts represent key components of the SAC [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, significant differential transcript abundance for tubulin isoforms was solely detected in the 24 h treatment groups, and different isoforms showed different directions of change (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> insert). It has been described previously that PDA-66 has a depolymerizing effect on tubulin assembly <italic>in vitro</italic> and acts as microtubule-destabilizing agent by its indole core [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, an autoregulatory mechanism of tubulin transcription has been proposed whereby tubulin mRNA expression/stability is negatively regulated by soluble unpolymerized tubulin dimers accumulating within the cell [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Taken together the enrichment of G2/M phase-specific transcripts and the later perturbation of tubulin isoform expression suggest a cell cycle arrest at the SAC rather than DDR. Such a SAC arrest was recently also reported on a different indole-containing anti-cancer agent [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that PDA-66 as well as PDA-377 significantly inhibit the proliferation and metabolic activity of two canine lymphoma cell lines and induce apoptosis as previously demonstrated for human neuroblastoma, lung carcinoma and ALL cells, also with dose-dependent G2 arrest [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Our results show that PDA-66 possesses potential anti-cancer activity through SAC activation.</p><p>The characterization of PDA-induced effects on canine lymphoma cells provides a basis for further <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. Early pharmacokinetic studies in mice revealed that i.p. application of 100 mg/kg PDA-66 once daily was well tolerated. One hour after injection plasma concentrations between 4 and 7 &#x003bc;mol/L were achieved rapidly decreasing exponentially to nearly zero after five hours (data not shown).</p><p>However, an application in dogs with spontaneously occurring lymphoma could allow evaluating the compound in presence of an immune system. Consequently, single or combination therapy with PDA-66 in dogs can provide valuable information before compound testing in humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Arylindolylmaleimides PDA-66 and PDA-377</title><p>PDA-66 and PDA-377 were synthesized and kindly provided by the Leibniz Institute for Catalysis (Rostock, Germany).

Simultaneously, a picture of each attempt was captured every 15 min during the whole incubation time and single pictures were combined to a Live cell imaging video.</p></sec><sec id="s4_7"><title>Pappenheim staining</title><p>Cells were treated with DMSO, 1.5 &#x003bc;M PDA-66 and 2.5 &#x003bc;M PDA-377 for 72 h. Glass slides were prepared with 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> cells with Cytospin 3 centrifuge (Shandon, Frankfurt/Main, Germany). Briefly, slides were stained in May-Gr&#x000fc;nwald working solution (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for 6 min, rinsed with tap water, then stained 20 min in Giemsa working solution (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and rinsed thoroughly with tap water. The slides were air dried at room temperature before analysis. To evaluate morphological changes of the cells slides were analyzed by EVOS&#x000ae; XL Core Imaging System (AMG, Washington, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4_8"><title>Transcriptomic analyses</title><p>Due to the more pronounced effect of PDA-66 at cellular level, the transcriptome characterization was only performed for PDA-66.</p><p>CLBL-1 and CLBL-1M cells were treated with 0.025 % DMSO, 1.0 &#x003bc;M (low-dose) and 2.5 &#x003bc;M (high-dose) PDA-66. At 12 h and 24 h, cells were harvested and total RNA was extracted using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sample names are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Each treatment condition was prepared and sequenced in triplicates. For the preparation of sequencing libraries, 2 &#x003bc;g total RNA with RNA integrity numbers &#x0003e; 8 were used. Poly-A RNA was enriched and ligated to sequencing adapter using the NEBNext Ultra RNA preparation Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Sequencing was conducted on an Illumina NextSeq500 (Illumina, San Diego, USA) as single reads with 75 bp length. A total of 480 million reads were generated, which were mapped to the canine genome (Broad CanFam3.1/canFam3, Sep. 2011) using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Read counts were generated for annotated genes (EMBL gene ID nomenclature) using the R package GAGE [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Annotations referring to non-protein coding RNAs were censored from the final read count list.</p></sec><sec id="s4_9"><title>Bioinformatic analyses and statistics</title><p>Significant differences of metabolic activity between treatment and the DMSO control were calculated using Dunnett's multiple comparison test. The statistical analyses of cell count and apoptosis/necrosis were done using student's <italic>t-test</italic> (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, USA). Results are shown as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD). Differences were considered statistically significant if * <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c; 0.05.</p><p>Differential gene expression analysis from RNAseq data was conducted using the BioconductorR package edgeR [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Genes with less than 1 read count per million in more than 18 samples were censored. On average 4.5 million (STDEV: 745,000) mapped reads per sample were used for differential gene expression analyses. Each cell line/treatment group (n=3) was compared to the respective mock-treated (DMSO) control cells (n=3). Treatment groups were high-dose.12 h, high-dose.24 h, low-dose.12 h, low-dose.24 h. After multidimensional scaling and plotting of the data one CLBL-1 DMSO-treated control sample was identified as outlier and was censored, so that the CLBL-1-12h-DMSO group consisted of only two independent samples. In addition to the comparison of each treatment group within the two cell lines, genes that responded differently to 12 h and 24 h high-dose treatment in CLBL1 versus CLBL-1M were identified using the generalized linear model functionality of edgeR [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Genes with a false discovery rate-corrected <italic>p</italic>-value (FDR) of less than 0.001 were considered as significantly deregulated and were mapped to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways for functional enrichment analyses using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) Functional Annotation Tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/">http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY TABLE AND VIDEOS</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="oncotarget-07-35379-s001.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e1248" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="oncotarget-07-35379-s002.mp4" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e1250" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="oncotarget-07-35379-s003.mp4" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e1252" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to acknowledge the financial support of Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC) to Wen Liu.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn fn-type="con"><p><bold>Authors' contributions</bold></p><p>WL carried out cell count and Annexin V/PI analyses, Pappenheim staining, cell treatment and RNA extraction for whole transcriptome analysis, performed partial statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript.
