The median survival is 9-12 months, with neither chemotherapeutic nor targeted agents showing any substantial survival benefit in clinical trials in children with these tumours<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. We report the identification of recurrent activating mutations in the <italic>ACVR1</italic> gene, which encodes a type I activin receptor serine/threonine kinase, in 21% of DIPG samples. Strikingly, these somatic mutations (R206H, R258G, G328E/V/W, G356D) have not been reported previously in cancer, but are identical to those found in the germline of patients with the congenital childhood developmental disorder fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP)<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, and have been shown to constitutively activate the BMP/TGF-&#x003b2; signalling pathway. These mutations represent novel targets for therapeutic intervention in this otherwise incurable disease.</p><p id="P3">Recent high-throughput sequencing approaches have revealed a striking prevalence of K27M mutations in the genes encoding the histone variants H3.3 (<italic>H3F3A</italic>) or H3.1 (<italic>HIST1H3B</italic>) in the childhood brain tumour DIPG<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. This K-to-M substitution confers a trans-dominant ablation of global H3K27 trimethylation, which likely profoundly alters gene expression through de-repression of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) target genes<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Despite these advances in our understanding of the distinct biology of these tumours<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, approaches for desperately-needed specific novel therapeutic interventions are not clear, and little has been reported of the additional mutations accompanying these changes.</p><p id="P4">We carried out whole genome sequencing (WGS) on a unique series of 20 pre-treatment biopsy samples of DIPG, for which the patients underwent a safe stereotactic procedure<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, and whole exome sequencing (WES) on a further biopsy case as well as five samples obtained at autopsy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Histone H3 K27M mutations were observed in 23/26 (88%) cases, comprising 15/26 (58%) <italic>H3F3A</italic> and 8/26 (31%) <italic>HIST1H3B</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). These were not found in concert with mutations in the chaperones <italic>ATRX/DAXX</italic> as has been described for supratentorial paediatric glioblastoma (pGBM)<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. There was also an absence of other known glioma-related molecular abnormalities such as <italic>IDH1/2</italic>, <italic>BRAF, FGFR1</italic> mutations and gene fusions. The mutational spectrum of the untreated biopsy cases was not significantly different from the autopsies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>), although the treatment-na&#x000ef;ve samples had a low overall mutation rate, with a mean of 14.8 somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) per sample (range 0-25), significantly lower than observed in the radiation-treated autopsy cases (mean=32.0, range 14-50, p=0.004, t-test). There was a similarly significantly lower overall mutation rate in untreated samples taken at biopsy compared with autopsy cases (mean=0.76 <italic>vs</italic> 1.2 mutations per Mb, p=0.023, t-test).</p><p id="P5">11/26 (42%) DIPGs harboured somatic <italic>TP53</italic> mutations, with a further six cases (23%) shown to have SNVs in <italic>PPM1D</italic>, regulator of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK)-p53 signalling in response to cellular stress, and an additional case with a somatic <italic>ATM</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>), revealing non-overlapping targeting of a DNA damage response pathway in 18/26 (69%) DIPG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). We further identified non-overlapping recurrent alterations in the PI3-kinase pathway targeting <italic>PIK3CA, PIK3R1</italic> and <italic>PTEN</italic> through SNVs and microdeletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>), in addition to amplification of <italic>MET</italic> (1/26, 4%) as previously described<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, and truncating mutation of <italic>NF1</italic> (1/26, 4%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). We also identified novel recurrent somatic mutations in <italic>IGF2R</italic> (2/26, 8%), although these mutations are concurrent with others in the pathway, so their significance is unknown. In total, 12/26 (46%) DIPG cases harboured some form of alteration predicted to activate the RTK/PI3K/MAPK pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Heterozygous somatic coding mutations in the gene <italic>ACVR1</italic>, which encodes the activin A type I receptor ALK2, were observed in 7/26 (27%) cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). These were restricted to the specific codons 328 (c.983G&#x0003e;T, p.G328V, two cases; c.983G&#x0003e;A, p.G328E, two cases), 258 (c.772C&#x0003e;T, p.R258G, one case), and 356 (c.1067G&#x0003e;A p.G356D), all within the serine/threonine kinase domain; and 206 (c.617G&#x0003e;A, p.R206H, one case), within the glycine-serine (GS)-rich domain. Screening an extended series of 26 DIPG biopsy samples by Sanger sequencing identified further recurrences of these mutations, and an additional variant at position 328 (c.982G&#x0003e;T, p.G328W) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Overall, we identified 11/52 (21%) DIPG samples to harbour mutation in <italic>ACVR1</italic> at four different codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). These mutations appear highly specific to DIPG. SNVs in the <italic>ACVR1</italic> coding region are present in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>) database at an overall frequency of 20/5965 (0.3%), with no individual tumour type harbouring more than 2% frequency, and no mutations observed at any of the residues described in the present study, suggestive of a &#x02018;passenger&#x02019; effect in other cancers.</p><p id="P7"><italic>ACVR1</italic> mutations were found to co-segregate with the less common <italic>HIST1H3B</italic> K27M mutation in the canonical histone H3.1 variant (p&#x0003c;0.0001, Fishers exact test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>), as well as wild-type <italic>TP53</italic> (p=0.0103, Fishers exact test). There was also an association between H3.1 mutation and chromosome 2 gain (on which <italic>ACVR1</italic> is found at 2q24.1, p=0.0009, Fishers exact test). <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutations appear to mark a distinct subset of DIPG patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). There was a marked predominance of females in the <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutant tumour group (1.75:1 <italic>vs</italic> 0.64:1, p=0.05, Fishers exact test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>), as well as a relatively restricted age of onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>), compared to wild-type. Patients whose tumours harboured <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutations also had a longer overall survival (median=14.9 months vs 10.9 months) p=0.05, log-rank test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>), although outcome remained very poor. There were no significant differences in histology between the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>). WGS biopsy samples exemplifying this genotype with concurrent <italic>ACVR1</italic> and <italic>HIST1H3B</italic> mutations harboured an additional 10-19 somatic SNVs, and 0-9 SVs respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Remarkably, these somatic mutations in <italic>ACVR1</italic> are at identical residues to those described in the germline of patients with autosomal dominant congenital childhood developmental disorder fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP, OMIM:135100)<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. This debilitating disease is characterised by heterotopic ossification of soft connective tissue resulting in severe skeletal abnormalities<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Patients with classical clinical features of FOP carry heterozygous R206H mutations in the glycine and serine residue (GS) activation domain<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, whilst atypical patients with a less severe phenotype have been shown to harbour either R258S<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, G328E/R/W<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, G356D<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, or other heterozygous mutations in the GS and kinase domains<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. This latter series of mutations may be exposed at the interface with the GS domain and abrogate interactions with the negative regulator FKBP12<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. These mutations have been shown to constitutively activate the bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-dependent transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2; pathway in the absence of ligand binding, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">To investigate the specific role of <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutations in the context of DIPG, we assembled a panel of four DIPG patient-derived primary cultures (and one thalamic paediatric GBM culture harbouring an <italic>H3F3A</italic> K27M mutation), representing two <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutations (R206H and G328V) and three wild-type lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). RNAseq data demonstrated in these models that the mutant allele was expressed in approximately half the reads, also evidenced by Sanger sequencing of cDNA from patient sample NCHP_DIPG011 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). Treatment with the selective ALK2 inhibitor LDN-193189<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> resulted in marked inhibition of cell viability in all cells, with GI50 values ranging from 0.86 &#x02013; 2.1 &#x003bc;M, approximately 10-fold lower than the less potent parent compound dorsomorphin, with a trend towards increased sensitivity in the mutant cultures (p=0.10, F-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). Transfection of <italic>ACVR1</italic> wild-type thalamic GBM and DIPG cells (both <italic>H3F3A</italic> K27M) with FLAG-tagged mutations conferred an increased signalling through phospho-Smad 1/5/8, particularly for R206H, and to a lesser extent for G328E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). ACVR1 mutation may only be one mechanism by which this pathway is activated in DIPG, however, as high basal levels of phospho-Smad 1/5/8 were also observed for the <italic>H3F3A</italic> K27M mutant, <italic>ACVR1</italic> wild-type cells used in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). This may explain the lack of a more robust genotype-dependent response to the inhibitor, and also expand upon the population of patients which may benefit from targeting the receptor.</p><p id="P10">There are no reports to our knowledge of coincident FOP and DIPG, although the clinical features of both typical and atypical cases of FOP can commonly include neurological symptoms and have been reported in children to include cerebellar and brain stem abnormalities<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, including demyelinated lesions in the pons both of patients and mouse models<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. It will nonetheless be a challenge to identify the mechanism by which the temporal and spatial context of BMP/TGF-&#x003b2; pathway activation confer such differing clinical phenotypes. In experimental models of FOP, <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutations are associated with defects in stem cell maintenance, reprogramming and differentiation, offering links with cancer-related cellular processes. First generation ALK2 inhibitors such as dorsomorphin<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and LDN-193189<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> have been shown to downregulate intracellular BMP/TGF-&#x003b2; signalling and reduce heterotypic ossification, opening the tantalising possibility of CNS-penetrant compounds showing a similar potential in a childhood brain tumour otherwise devoid of efficacious treatment options.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S1" specific-use="web-only"><title>ONLINE METHODS</title><sec id="S2"><title>Tumour cohort</title><p id="P11">DIPG samples and matched peripheral blood were available from 21 patients who underwent a stereotactic biopsy at the Neurosurgery Department of Necker Sick Children&#x02019;s Hospital in Paris, France, 20 of whom were subjected to whole genome sequencing.
