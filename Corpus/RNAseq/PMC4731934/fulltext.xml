Despite large numbers of reported lncRNAs, reference annotations are likely incomplete due to their lower and tighter tissue-specific expression compared to mRNAs. An unexplored factor potentially confounding lncRNA identification is inter-individual expression variability. Here, we characterize lncRNA natural expression variability in human primary granulocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We annotate granulocyte lncRNAs and mRNAs in RNA-seq data from 10 healthy individuals, identifying multiple lncRNAs absent from reference annotations, and use this to investigate three known features (higher tissue-specificity, lower expression, and reduced splicing efficiency) of lncRNAs relative to mRNAs. Expression variability was examined in seven individuals sampled three times at 1- or more than 1-month intervals. We show that lncRNAs display significantly more inter-individual expression variability compared to mRNAs. We confirm this finding in two independent human datasets by analyzing multiple tissues from the GTEx project and lymphoblastoid cell lines from the GEUVADIS project. Using the latter dataset we also show that including more human donors into the transcriptome annotation pipeline allows identification of an increasing number of lncRNAs, but minimally affects mRNA gene number.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A comprehensive annotation of lncRNAs is known to require an approach that is sensitive to low and tight tissue-specific expression.

They are considered to participate primarily in mRNA gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and to play roles in development and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. LncRNAs may be medically relevant as prognostic factors, disease markers, and drug targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. To date, it is known that lncRNA genes are abundant in the genomes of human ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gencodegenes.org/stats.html">http://www.gencodegenes.org/stats.html</ext-link>), mouse ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gencodegenes.org/mouse_stats.html">http://www.gencodegenes.org/mouse_stats.html</ext-link>), other vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and simple model organisms such as <italic>C. elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Although large numbers of lncRNAs have been identified, they have not yet been completely annotated in any organism. Human lncRNAs annotated by the GENCODE project comprise the largest public dataset containing 15,877 lncRNA genes (version 21: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gencodegenes.org/stats/archive.html#a21">http://www.gencodegenes.org/stats/archive.html#a21</ext-link>). Many human annotation projects use cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], however, some also use primary tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. An incomplete annotation may arise from two known features of lncRNAs - low abundance and tight tissue-specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Notably, lncRNA annotations differ not just between tissues, but also between closely related cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Thus, a comprehensive map of all lncRNA genes in the human genome would require systematic and deep analysis of all human body cell types. A recent attempt to define the human lncRNA landscape used several thousand normal and malignant samples and identified almost 47,000 new lncRNA genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], supporting earlier predictions that lncRNAs may outnumber protein-coding genes in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Relatively small numbers of mammalian lncRNAs have been assigned a function. A new functional lncRNA database lists only 181 human transcripts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lncrnadb.org/">http://www.lncrnadb.org/</ext-link>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]). While it is possible that some lncRNA transcription is a consequence of the local chromatin state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], the gap between annotation and proven functionality reflects the considerable challenges in the analysis of non-coding compared to coding transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. A deeper knowledge of lncRNAs as a transcript class has followed from genome-wide characterizations of their biology and genomic features with mRNAs as a reference point (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]). Both types of transcripts are transcribed by RNAPII, possess histone modifications typical of active or inactive genes and can be spliced, capped, and polyadenylated (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]). However, in addition to the basic lack of an open reading frame and functional translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], some studies have identified characteristics that differentiate lncRNAs from mRNAs. In comparison to mRNAs, lncRNAs are generally found to be more lowly-expressed, show higher tissue-specificity and be enriched in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Many lncRNAs initiate from enhancer-like promoters that lack H3K4me3 histone modifications typical of standard mRNA promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], or from repetitive transposable elements normally absent from standard mRNA promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In terms of genome and biology features, lncRNAs are usually shorter with fewer exons and show inefficient co-transcriptional splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and reduced stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. They also show low sequence conservation and evolve faster than mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p><p>One lncRNA feature not yet fully investigated in comparison to mRNAs that may influence identification and functional characterization is their natural expression variation. Protein-coding and lncRNA expression and transcript structure have been shown to be dependent on genetic variation in the human lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Analysis of protein-coding gene expression in whole human blood shows expression variation attributable to inter-individual (for example, age, BMI) and lifestyle (fasting status, smoking) differences, and technical issues such as sampling time, collection and preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. In this study we use human primary granulocytes, a relatively pure cell type routinely obtained in clinics from healthy individuals and potentially useful diagnostically, to assess natural variability of lncRNA expression. We first prepared an RNA-seq dataset from 10 healthy individuals to define a human granulocyte transcriptome, not previously available. From this we annotated 6,249 lncRNA transcripts arising from 1,323 previously reported and 268 novel lncRNA loci. We show that examining granulocytes from multiple donors allows the identification of less well expressed, less efficiently spliced, and more granulocyte-specific lncRNAs. We then estimated lncRNA expression reproducibility and variability in granulocyte RNA-seq data from seven healthy individuals sampled in three replicates with approximately 1-month intervals. This inter- and intra-individual comparison demonstrated that although lncRNA expression is reproducible between replicates from the same individual, it is significantly more variable between individuals compared to mRNAs. Analysis of multiple tissues from the GTEx project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] and lymphoblastoid cell lines from the GEUVADIS project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] supports this conclusion and also shows that higher natural expression variability compared to protein-coding genes is a general feature of lncRNAs. Using the latter dataset we show that natural expression variability markedly influences lncRNA identification as the number of identified lncRNAs increases with the number of donors analyzed and does not reach saturation even with 120 donors. Together, the data show that high expression variability of lncRNAs is an important general feature, which not only additionally distinguishes them from mRNAs, but also will make it necessary to consider the number of individuals in strategies to comprehensively annotate and assign putative functions to lncRNAs in the human genome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Defining the human granulocyte lncRNA transcriptome</title><p>To annotate lncRNAs in human granulocytes we collected samples from five male and five female healthy individuals of varying ages under standardized sampling conditions and sequenced polyadenylated (PolyA+) RNA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>, Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1A and Supplemental Methods,&#x000a0;Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>A). Ribosome-depleted RNA-seq, used for expression and splicing efficiency analysis, was performed for seven donors (4 male donors, 3 female donors) at three time points. To annotate lncRNAs we aligned the PolyA+ RNA-seq data with STAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] to obtain 757 million uniquely-mapped reads of which 187.6 million were spliced (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>B, C) and performed <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assembly using Cufflinks and Cuffmerge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The term &#x02018;<italic>de novo</italic>&#x02019; is used for transcripts/loci identified in this transcriptome assembly pipeline. Only multi-exonic transcripts longer than 200 base pairs (bp) were retained and several filtering steps applied to remove potential assembly artifacts (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). We next extracted multi-exonic transcripts overlapping exons annotated as protein-coding in GENCODE-v19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] and RefSeq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] and used them later to generate a <italic>de novo</italic> protein-coding granulocyte mRNA annotation. We discarded annotated GENCODE-v19 pseudogene transcripts. To remove potential protein/peptide-coding transcripts, we estimated transcript protein-coding capability using RNAcode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] and CPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. We adjusted the criteria for the output of the protein-coding potential estimation pipeline (RNAcode score &#x0003c;18, CPC score &#x0003c;1.6) by analyzing well-known lncRNAs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>D). We validated these criteria by applying the pipeline to the above public annotations; this identified the majority of annotated lncRNAs as non-protein-coding, whereas the majority of mRNAs were identified as protein-coding (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>:Figure S1E). To avoid confusion in later expression analysis we removed all lncRNAs overlapping a protein-coding gene in sense direction (for example, intronic lncRNAs) from our analysis. The final <italic>de novo</italic> lncRNA granulocyte annotation comprised 1,591 lncRNA loci (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>) expressing 6,249 lncRNA transcripts (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>) with a mean of 3.9 transcript isoforms per locus, consistent with previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. <italic>De novo</italic> lncRNA transcripts contained 13,058 unique exons from 5,612 non-overlapping exonic regions. Protein-coding mRNAs were <italic>de novo</italic> annotated in preference to using the public annotations to avoid technical bias when comparing lncRNAs to mRNAs and to assess the quality of our annotation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2). The <italic>de novo</italic> granulocyte mRNA annotation comprised 10,092 mRNA loci (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>) expressing 132,864 transcripts (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>) with a mean of 13.2 transcripts per locus, consistent with previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. We assigned <italic>de novo</italic> annotated lncRNAs into three position-based classes relative to the nearest protein-coding gene (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). The majority of lncRNA loci (42&#x000a0;% comprising 659 loci) are intergenic, while 33&#x000a0;% (530 loci) are antisense and 25&#x000a0;% (402) are bidirectional.

Exon comparison with the three public annotations showed that we identified 5,694 new unique exons from 2,986 non-overlapping exonic regions. This shows that granulocytes have a specific lncRNA landscape that needs to be defined prior to granulocyte transcriptome analysis. To further assess the novelty of the annotated granulocyte <italic>de novo</italic> lncRNA loci we examined the MiTranscriptome lncRNA annotation based on 7,256 RNA-seq libraries from different human tissues, tumors, and cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Together, this shows that while 83&#x000a0;% of the lncRNA loci identified in this study can be found in one of the four above lncRNA annotations, 268 (17&#x000a0;%) are not found (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). To test the reliability of our granulocyte <italic>de novo</italic> lncRNA annotation we first determined that over 80&#x000a0;% of transcripts were supported by at least one exonic overlap with a spliced EST (human ESTs, UCSC table browser) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3A). Second, the MiTranscriptome lncRNA annotation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] provided an additional validation as 78&#x000a0;% of our granulocyte <italic>de novo</italic> annotated lncRNAs were supported by an exonic overlap with a spliced MiTranscriptome lncRNA (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3B) with a median of 51&#x000a0;% exonic coverage of granulocyte <italic>de novo</italic> lncRNAs by MiTranscriptome lncRNAs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3C). Public lncRNAs annotations had less overlap with our annotation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3B) and showed poorer exonic coverage (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3C) and thus provided support for fewer of our granulocyte <italic>de novo</italic> lncRNA transcripts. In contrast, <italic>de novo</italic> mRNAs were well covered by public mRNA annotations and MiTranscriptome (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3B, D), indicating that the poor lncRNA coverage may arise from incomplete annotation of this transcript type in public annotations.

These data were aligned as in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and expression levels calculated for <italic>de novo</italic> annotated granulocyte transcripts. A transcript was considered granulocyte-specific if its expression in granulocytes was at least three-fold higher than in all other cell types. We found granulocyte-specific expression of 32.5&#x000a0;% (1,927) <italic>de novo</italic> annotated lncRNA transcripts and 4&#x000a0;% of <italic>de novo</italic> annotated mRNA transcripts (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S9A).

The same analysis performed for GENCODE-v19 transcripts that are annotated from multiple sample types shows a decreased percentage of lncRNAs (9.0&#x000a0;%) and mRNAs (1.5&#x000a0;%) identified as granulocyte-specific, but a similarly large difference (six-fold) between the two transcript types (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S9C). Analysis of tissue-specific expression performed separately for the three lncRNA transcript classes described above, shows that &#x02018;in PA&#x02019; lncRNAs were more similar to GENCODE-v19 transcripts being depleted for granulocyte-specific transcripts compared to the bulk population (dashed green line, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), while &#x02018;not in PA&#x02019; and &#x02018;isoform not in PA&#x02019; transcripts showed equal or increased granulocyte-specificity.</p><p>Expression level is another feature strongly differentiating lncRNAs and mRNAs. We calculated RPKMs of granulocyte <italic>de novo</italic> lncRNA and mRNA transcripts in the PolyA+ data used for the <italic>de novo</italic> annotation, which showed that lncRNA transcripts are 10-fold less abundant than mRNAs (0.65/6.14, respectively; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). We noted that lncRNA/mRNA expression difference was slightly reduced (seven-fold median difference) when analyzing ribosomal-depleted datasets, indicating lncRNA under-representation in PolyA+ RNA (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S11A). Comparing the three lncRNA transcript classes showed that &#x02018;in PA&#x02019; transcripts display highest expression and &#x02018;not in PA&#x02019; have lowest expression among the three classes in both PolyA+ (see inset, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>) and ribosomal-depleted (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S11F) data.</p><p>The third feature that may influence lncRNA identification is their reduced polyadenylation efficiency, as this would lower abundance in the PolyA+ fraction usually used for transcript identification. Given our above observation of poorer lncRNA representation in PolyA+ versus ribosome-depleted datasets, we compared transcript abundance in these granulocyte datasets to estimate the enrichment of lncRNAs and mRNAs in the PolyA+ fraction (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). While mRNAs showed a median 2.6-fold enrichment, lncRNAs showed a significantly lower median 1.6-fold enrichment (dashed green line, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). We tested if this difference was influenced by low lncRNA expression levels by splitting transcripts into expression bins (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S12A). This showed that independently of absolute expression levels, lncRNAs show significantly lower PolyA+ enrichment compared to mRNAs. Comparing the three lncRNA transcript classes demonstrated that &#x02018;not in PA&#x02019; and &#x02018;isoform not in PA&#x02019; transcripts showed significantly lower PolyA+ enrichment than &#x02018;in PA&#x02019; transcripts (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>).</p><p>Inefficient splicing is a fourth feature likely to reduce full-length lncRNA transcripts in the PolyA+ fraction. We used granulocyte ribosomal-depleted RNA-seq to calculate the splicing efficiency of every splice site in lncRNA and mRNA transcripts and defined transcript splicing efficiency as that of its most efficiently processed splice site (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S13A, B). This shows that splicing is significantly less efficient for lncRNAs compared to mRNAs with a median splicing efficiency of 88.13&#x000a0;% (dashed green line, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>) and 99.02&#x000a0;%, respectively. This splicing efficiency difference is independent of expression level and also persists at the locus level, that is, independently of the transcripts number per locus (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figures S12B and S13C). The inefficient splicing of lncRNAs is supported by the experimental validation of lncRNA spliced products described above, which identified abundant unspliced isoforms together with spliced isoforms (see examples in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figures S5B, S5C, S7A, and S13B, E). Comparing the three lncRNA transcript classes showed that &#x02018;not in PA&#x02019; transcripts have lower splicing efficiency than the bulk population analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). The similar splicing efficiency in classes &#x02018;isoform not in PA&#x02019; and &#x02018;in PA&#x02019; arises from transcripts sharing some splice sites. The reduced splicing of lncRNAs &#x02018;not in PA&#x02019; was confirmed by analysis on the locus level (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S13D).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Reproducibility of <italic>de novo</italic> lncRNA and mRNA expression. <bold>a</bold> Study overview.

Transcripts detectable in each of seven donors (average RPKM of three replicates &#x0003e;0.2) show inter-individual reproducibility. Five expression bins were used: (1) 0.5&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;RPKM &#x02264;1; (2) 1&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;RPKM &#x02264;2; (3) 2&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;RPKM &#x02264;4; (4) 4&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;RPKM &#x02264;8; and (5) RPKM &#x0003e;8 (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;transcript number per bin). Chromosomes X, Y were discarded</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13059_2016_873_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p>In addition to these four RNA biology features, we examined four genomic features. This showed that compared to mRNAs, lncRNAs transcripts have significantly fewer exons, their transcription starts are less CG-rich but more repeat-rich, and their exons contain more repeats (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figures S11B-E and S12C). With the exception of the median exon number, these features were more extreme in &#x02018;not in PA&#x02019; and &#x02018;isoform not in PA&#x02019; lncRNAs than in the class of &#x02018;in PA&#x02019; lncRNAs. Together this shows that new granulocyte lncRNAs identified in this study have less mRNA-like features that further distinguish them from mRNAs compared to the bulk lncRNA population. To support this claim we performed the same analysis for MiTranscriptome mRNAs and lncRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], which also shows that lncRNAs not in public annotations have less mRNA-like features (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figures S14 and S15). Thus we show that features such as tight tissue-specificity and low expression, reduced enrichment in PolyA+ selected RNA and reduced splicing efficiency, not only distinguish lncRNAs from mRNAs, but by reducing their representation in the analyzed transcriptome make their identification more challenging.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>LncRNAs are reproducibly expressed within one donor but vary between donors</title><p>We next investigated reproducibility of lncRNA expression in healthy individuals to assess if this could also influence the lncRNA discovery. To estimate expression reproducibility within or between donors, we examined expression in granulocytes from seven donors sampled at three time points spaced by at least 1&#x000a0;month (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>A). These 21 samples were subject to ribosome-depleted RNA-seq (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>B) aligned with STAR and expression levels were determined of all <italic>de novo</italic> annotated lncRNAs and mRNAs. We first tested if annotated transcripts were reproducibly expressed within one donor, that is, the three time points for each donor should show consistent lncRNA expression (RPKM &#x0003e;0.2) or absence (RPKM &#x02264;0.2) of expression (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> top). This analysis was performed separately for transcripts with different expression levels. Expression levels for each donor were calculated by averaging RPKMs from the three time points and a transcript was placed into a bin according to its maximal expression level among the seven donors. We counted the number of reproducibly-expressed transcripts and found that lncRNAs are less reproducible in bins 1 and 2, but above RPKM &#x0003e;2 almost all <italic>de novo</italic> annotated lncRNAs and mRNAs (99&#x02013;100&#x000a0;%) were reproducibly detected within one donor. In contrast, comparing expression between the seven donors showed consistent lower expression reproducibility of lncRNAs compared to mRNAs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, bottom). In the three highest expression bins, mRNAs showed 100&#x000a0;% reproducibility while lncRNA transcripts only reached 95&#x000a0;%. In summary, this qualitative analysis shows that, above an expression threshold (RPKM &#x0003e;2), lncRNAs are as reproducibly expressed as mRNAs within replicates from one donor. However, lncRNAs show less reproducible expression than mRNAs between different donors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>LncRNAs show high expression variability between donors</title><p>We quantitated the extent of expression variability between the seven donors by calculating the standard deviation of granulocyte <italic>de novo</italic> lncRNA and mRNA expression (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a, b</xref>). As RPKM is a parametric value and ranges from 0.2 (the used expression cutoff) to several thousand, we normalized standard deviation of expression for each gene between donors by the mean of expression among the seven donors (thus calculating the value also known as the coefficient of variation). We performed this analysis calculating variability of expression for each transcript separately (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), and expression of the whole locus disregarding identified exon structures (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S10). Both analyses showed that lncRNAs display significantly higher variability than mRNAs (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02013;16</sup>).

In addition, both inter- and intra-individual expression variability of lncRNAs exceeded that of mRNAs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S16).

We controlled for this by distributing transcripts and loci into expression bins (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S17). This showed that while variability anti-correlates with expression level for both lncRNAs and mRNAs, lncRNAs analyzed at the transcript or loci level show consistently more expression variability than mRNAs, independent of absolute expression level. We additionally plotted expression variability against mean expression between all donors for lncRNA and mRNA transcripts and loci (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S18A, B). This showed that the trend lines of the anti-correlation between variability and expression level are clearly distinct for lncRNAs and mRNAs at both transcript and loci level, with lncRNAs displaying higher variability. Thus, high natural expression variability is not an artifact of the general low expression of lncRNAs. To identify the number of lncRNA and mRNA transcripts and loci significantly variable between donors we applied an ANOVA test (<italic>aov</italic> function in R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]) to expression values in all the 21 (that is, seven donors sampled three times) ribosomal depleted RNA-seq samples.

This trend persisted when applying an ANOVA test to expression over whole loci (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>, 15.5&#x000a0;% and 4.4&#x000a0;% for lncRNA and mRNA loci, respectively).

Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref> shows an example of a significantly variable lncRNA expressed from chromosome 15. Among the four displayed tracks donors 3 and 4 show higher expression, consistent among three replicates, while donors 1 and 2 show low expression consistent among replicates. Since 25&#x000a0;% of <italic>de novo</italic> annotated lncRNAs are bidirectional and likely share a promoter with an mRNA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), we examined if this class resemble mRNAs in having less expression variability. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref> shows that bidirectional lncRNA transcripts more closely resembled mRNAs and were significantly less variable than antisense or intergenic lncRNAs and this trend was also observed in all expression bins and over the whole locus (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S20A-C).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Publicly annotated lncRNAs show less expression variability</title><p>To further confirm high lncRNA expression variability and to investigate its impact on lncRNA identification, we analyzed expression variability of publicly annotated (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S21A, B) and of MiTranscriptome (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S22A, B) lncRNAs and mRNAs in our granulocyte RNA-seq data. All annotations confirmed high lncRNA expression variability compared to mRNAs. However, the extent of the lncRNA/mRNA difference was reduced when analyzing public annotations compared to the MiTranscriptome annotation and our <italic>de novo</italic> granulocyte annotation, which both identified numerous novel lncRNAs. We then estimated expression variability separately for the three lncRNA classes described in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, and found that transcript types &#x02018;not in PA&#x02019; and &#x02018;isoform not in PA&#x02019; showed significantly higher variability between the seven donors, compared to &#x02018;in PA&#x02019; transcripts (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>) and this trend was observed in all expression bins (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S23A) and also when analyzing expression over whole locus for &#x02018;new&#x02019; and &#x02018;known&#x02019; lncRNA loci (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S23B, C). To test this further, we analyzed expression variability of MiTranscriptome lncRNAs classified according to their presence in public annotations (as described in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S14D).

Since LCL are a different cell type to granulocytes, we created a <italic>de novo</italic> LCL annotation via our pipeline (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S24A). From the list of 462 samples, we used RNA-seq data from 20 unrelated donors (2 female donors and 2 male donors from each population with a total of 522 (26.1 million reads/donor) million uniquely mapped reads and 177.8 million spliced reads) grouped into five pools (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>I). The resulting LCL lncRNA transcriptome consisted of 2,611 lncRNA loci (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>) formed by 8,560 lncRNA transcripts (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>) with a mean of 3.3 transcripts per locus (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). The lncRNA transcripts contained 17,009 unique exons from 9,379 non-overlapping regions. We also annotated 12,241 <italic>de novo</italic> mRNA loci formed by 124,799 transcripts, with a mean of 10.1 transcript per locus. The overlap of LCL and granulocyte <italic>de novo</italic> lncRNA transcriptomes comprised only 536 loci (21&#x000a0;%) whereas the <italic>de novo</italic> mRNA transcriptomes overlapped by 9,357 loci (76&#x000a0;%), which is consistent with lncRNA high tissue-specificity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). The increase in lncRNA loci number from 1,591 in granulocytes, to 2,611 in LCL may reflect increased transcriptional activity of LCL compared to primary granulocytes or the two-fold increase in donor number used for annotation (see data below). Comparison of the LCL <italic>de novo</italic> lncRNA annotation to public annotations and MiTranscriptome showed that 2,316 (89&#x000a0;%) of LCL lncRNA loci are covered by the four lncRNA annotations while 295 (11&#x000a0;%) are not found (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>).

It is likely that such a lncRNA has a low chance of discovery when analyzing few individuals. We hypothesized that adding more individuals to the identification pipeline may increase the chance of identifying highly variably expressed lncRNAs. At the same time, given the relatively low inter-individual expression variability of mRNAs, we would expect to identify a relatively constant number of mRNA loci.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Increasing donor number identifies more lncRNA loci. <bold>a</bold> Example of a highly variable LCL lncRNA locus lcl1580 not in public annotations.

We picked 120 GEUVADIS LCL donors (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>A), unified the data by sampling 25 million paired-end reads from each donor and created 30 pools, each with four donors (two male and two female donors) with a total of 100 (25&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;4) million reads. From the 30 pools we created 30 LCL <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assemblies using Cufflinks. We randomly picked 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25 (using three replicates of random picking), and 30 assemblies, which corresponded to 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 donors, respectively, and applied Cuffmerge and the <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome annotation pipeline to each group of assemblies (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S31A, B and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>B). Only one pool (100 million reads) was fed at a time into the assembly pipeline, thus the sensitivity of Cufflinks was unchanged. In addition, assemblies but not reads were merged at this stage. Different number of assemblies fed into our annotation pipeline produced multiple lncRNA/mRNA annotations with different numbers of loci and transcripts. We plotted the number of mRNA and lncRNA loci (averaged from the three replicates described above) versus the number of donors used (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>C). This showed that while lncRNA loci number (green lines) grew three-fold with increasing donor number, from 1,382 loci obtained from four donors to 4,166 obtained from 120 donors, the number of mRNA loci (blue lines) shows a much lower level of increase from 12,085 (four donors) to 12,857 loci (120 donors). This supports the hypothesis that adding more individuals to the identification pipeline increases the number of lncRNA loci but not the number of mRNA loci.</p><p>In contrast to the loci analysis, the number of transcript isoforms increased with similar kinetics for both lncRNAs and mRNAs (approximately seven-fold increase from four to 120 donors; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S31C). The difference between lncRNAs and mRNAs is that an increasing donor number allows identification of an increasing number of transcript isoforms inside a stable number of mRNA loci, while lncRNAs retain a low median number of transcripts per locus and increase the number of loci annotated in the genome (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S31D). Note that we did not expect to find non-annotated mRNAs loci since the mRNA <italic>de novo</italic> identification pipeline was limited to annotated mRNA genes. If the analysis did identify non-annotated mRNA loci they would be recognized among lncRNA candidates that were filtered by the pipeline step that estimated transcript protein-coding capability. However, this step only removed a low-level increase from 83 (four donors) to 198 (120 donors) loci (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S31E). The slight increase in mRNA loci number with increasing donor number (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>) likely arises from high inter-individual expression variability of a small number of mRNAs in LCLs. The larger increase in lncRNA loci number also arises from identifying more highly variable annotated lncRNAs when analyzing more donors, but also potentially by identifying novel lncRNA loci.</p><p>Assembling transcriptomes from pools of 100 million paired-end read does not increase Cufflinks sensitivity (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S31A), but including more donors into the identification pipeline naturally increased the number of transcriptome assemblies merged and therefore the total amount of the RNA-seq data analyzed (from 1 to 30&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>8</sup> sequencing reads). To control that this strategy did not only lead to the identification of marginally-expressed lncRNAs we plotted the RPKM of lncRNAs added to annotation with the addition of more donors (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S32). This shows that median level of expression (in at least one donor used for identification) of newly-identified lncRNAs is RPKM of approximately 1, which means that 50&#x000a0;% of the newly-identified lncRNA transcripts are well-expressed (RPKM &#x0003e;1). This median level also does not decrease for transcripts that are only found with large donor numbers. In addition, we analyzed the dynamics of lncRNA identification with increasing the donor number in different expression bins (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S33). This shows that lncRNAs from high-expression bins contribute substantially to the overall increase in lncRNA loci and transcript number. For example, four donor annotations identified 314 lncRNA transcripts initiating from 152 different loci in bin4 (that is, at least one donor used for identification expresses the transcript with 4&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;RPKM&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;8), while annotating from 120 donors identified 3,518 bin4-lncRNA transcripts initiating from 610 loci. Thus, while marginally-expressed lncRNAs are identified by adding more donors to the analysis, they only constitute a fraction of the newly-identified transcripts. Both controls show that identification of an increasing number of lncRNAs cannot be solely attributed to stochastic sampling sensitivity and identification of lowly-expressed transcripts, but likely arises from genuine expression variability between individuals.</p><p>We next asked if the lncRNA loci identified with increased donor numbers were new or known loci (as defined in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) and what were the dynamics of their identification. To do this we plotted the normalized number (the number of loci at 120 donors set to 100&#x000a0;%) of known (dark gray) and new (light gray) lncRNA loci versus donor number (Figure S34 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S34 and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>C). For comparison the same plot shows the dynamics of mRNA (dashed blue line) and all lncRNA (dashed green line) identification from the data in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>. This shows that although the number of known lncRNA loci increases with donor number from 948.5 (four donors,) to 2,103 (120 donors), the number of novel lncRNA loci shows a more striking increase from 433.7 to 2063 loci (2.2-fold and 4.8-fold, respectively; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S34) (note that non-integer loci numbers arise from averaging three replicates). While mRNA loci identification plateaued with four donors, the known lncRNA loci identification curve starts to plateau with &#x0003e;80 donors, but the new lncRNA identification curve does not plateau up to 120 donors.</p><p>Finally, we used the most comprehensive <italic>de novo</italic> annotation from 120 donors as a reference transcriptome to build a &#x02018;donor saturation curve&#x02019; to test how well this annotation can be recreated using fewer individuals. We counted the number of reference 120 donor lncRNA and mRNA loci identified (defined by &#x0003e;50&#x000a0;% coverage, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S35A, top, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>D) using a reduced number of donors. The resulting curve saturates for mRNAs, but does not saturate for lncRNAs even with 120 individuals. Only 27&#x000a0;% of lncRNA loci identified with 120 donors were identified using four donors, this increased to 50&#x000a0;% at 20 donors and thereafter continuing to rise. The difference between known and new lncRNA loci was consistent with observations in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S34. We also assessed how well the exon structure of mRNAs and lncRNAs from the reference 120 donor annotation was recreated by annotations obtained using fewer donors (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S35B). Median exonic coverage of mRNAs was above 90&#x000a0;% just using four donors, whereas lncRNAs require 80 donors to reach similar levels of exonic coverage. In summary, these analyses show that increasing the donor number will identify more lncRNA loci, however, the donor number required is vastly in excess of that required for mRNAs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>An appreciation of the need to define the lncRNA landscape of the whole human genome is increasing with the number of known lncRNAs genes and with an understanding of the unique qualities of their biology. Although the GENCODE annotation comprises the largest public dataset with 15,877 lncRNA genes (version 21: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gencodegenes.org/stats/archive.html#a21">http://www.gencodegenes.org/stats/archive.html#a21</ext-link>), later studies that used several thousand normal and malignant samples from numerous individuals identified four-fold more lncRNA genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Why the number of lncRNAs continues to rise apparently in excess of protein-coding gene number, is not yet clear. In this study we set out to annotate the lncRNA transcriptome of freshly harvested human granulocytes with the goal of investigating lncRNA inter-individual expression variability and determining how this influences lncRNA identification.</p><p>The resulting human granulocyte transcriptome obtained from 10 healthy individuals identified 1,591 lncRNA loci with a mean of 3.9 transcripts per locus. The same granulocytes express approximately six-fold more mRNA loci each with approximately three-fold more transcripts. The reduced activity of lncRNA loci relative to protein-coding loci has been noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Comparing the granulocyte <italic>de novo</italic> annotation to the most commonly used public annotations (GENCODEv19: 23,898 lncRNA transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], RefSeq: 8,236 lncRNA transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], Cabili: 21,630 lncRNA transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]) that together contain 19,762 non-overlapping lncRNA loci, shows that one-third of granulocyte <italic>de novo</italic> lncRNA transcripts are not present and one-third added a new isoform to public-annotated loci. A comparison with the recent massive MiTranscriptome lncRNA annotation containing 46,331 new lncRNA loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], showed that 268 granulocyte lncRNA loci (17&#x000a0;% of the annotated granulocyte lncRNA transcriptome) were not previously reported. With the caveat that different annotation pipelines may influence identification, this shows that human granulocytes have a specific lncRNA landscape that needs to be defined prior to transcriptome analysis, rather than relying on integrative lncRNA landscapes from multiple cell types.</p><p>The identification of numerous new human granulocyte lncRNA loci is surprising in view of the extremely large numbers present in public annotations or datasets. Because of this we investigated if specific lncRNA biology features contribute to their under-representation in public databases by assessing if they were more prominent in new loci or isoforms. We first investigated four known features, that is, very tight tissue-specific expression, lower expression level, inefficient enrichment in PolyA+ selected fractions, and inefficient splicing (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]). In each case we demonstrated a significant difference for these features between lncRNAs and mRNAs and, in addition, demonstrated that these features are more prominent in new lncRNA loci and transcript isoforms. For example, reports from different species show that lncRNAs compared to mRNAs have tight tissue-specific expression and also are generally more lowly expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. We found that while only 4&#x000a0;% of mRNA transcripts display granulocyte-specific expression, 32&#x000a0;% of lncRNA transcripts, and 57&#x000a0;% of novel lncRNA transcripts were granulocyte-specific. Similarly, lncRNA expression levels were 10-fold less abundant than mRNAs, as reported in many species (see above references), however expression of novel &#x02018;not in PA&#x02019; lncRNA transcripts was 13-fold less abundant. We could also show that lncRNA enrichment in the PolyA+ fraction relative to total ribosomal-depleted fraction was reduced compared to mRNAs (respective median enrichments of 1.6-fold and 2.6-fold) in agreement with findings that a proportion of lncRNAs are not polyadenylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>] and that this reduction was 1.6-fold greater for novel &#x02018;not in PA&#x02019; lncRNA transcripts. A relatively new feature reported for imprinted <italic>cis</italic>-repressor lncRNAs such as <italic>Airn</italic> and <italic>Ube3a-ats</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] and for some lncRNAs in human K562 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] that could also affect the abundance of full-length transcripts in PolyA+ RNA fractions, is inefficient splicing. We accessed splicing efficiency of lncRNAs and mRNAs in our granulocyte data and showed that compared to mRNAs, lncRNAs are less efficiently spliced with a broad distribution of splicing efficiency. Median lncRNA splicing efficiency was reduced by 10.9&#x000a0;% compared to mRNAs, however, novel lncRNA transcripts showed 22.9&#x000a0;% reduction. We confirmed the inefficient splicing of lncRNAs and the greater reduction in novel lncRNA using the independent MiTranscriptome annotation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Together this analysis shows not only that lncRNAs share several non-mRNA-like biology features, but also that these features are more prominent in new lncRNA loci and transcript isoforms and thus are likely to reduce lncRNA representation in public annotations.</p><p>The last feature examined that could influence the incomplete representation of lncRNAs in public databases is that of natural expression variation. We used the granulocyte annotation with seven donors sampled at three time points separated by at least 1&#x000a0;month, to estimate the natural expression variability of lncRNAs relative to mRNAs. This analysis shows that lncRNA expression is unexpectedly highly variable among a population and, while relatively stable over time within an individual, lncRNA expression variation is significantly larger than that of mRNAs independent of expression level. We find that when considering all the 6,249 <italic>de novo</italic> annotated granulocyte lncRNA transcripts only 40&#x000a0;% (2,490) are robustly expressed, while 17&#x000a0;% (1,069) display significant inter-individual variable expression even within the small sample size of seven donors. Importantly, we show that high natural expression variability is not a consequence of the generally low expression of lncRNAs, as lncRNA transcripts/loci in all expression bins were more variable than mRNAs and also displayed higher percentage of significant inter-individual variable expression assessed by ANOVA test. The high inter-individual variability of lncRNA expression was unique enough to allow unsupervised grouping of replicates sampled over several months according to each of the seven donors. We verified high lncRNA inter-individual expression variability by demonstrating a similar difference for MiTranscriptome annotated transcripts expressed in granulocytes. We also analyzed an independent public RNA-seq lymphoblastoid cell dataset from GEUVADIS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. This LCL dataset derived from 462 donors displayed an overall higher median expression variability for both mRNAs and lncRNAs than the granulocyte dataset consisting of seven donors; however, the relative two-fold difference between lncRNAs and mRNAs loci and transcripts was similar. In each of the three above analyses we could show that novel lncRNA transcripts display higher expression variability than known lncRNA transcripts. Lastly, we demonstrated that high lncRNA inter-individual expression variability relative to mRNAs is a general phenomenon in human tissues, by analyzing multiple tissues from the GTEx project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Interestingly, although we analyzed the same number of donors per tissue we found different absolute levels of lncRNA and mRNA expression variability, with skeletal muscle displaying the highest and LCL, nerve, and thyroid displaying the lowest variability level. As an important control, analyzing LCL in the GTEx dataset using the MiTranscriptome annotation showed similar levels of expression variability as that obtained by analyzing the GEUVADIS LCL dataset using our <italic>de novo</italic> LCL annotation. Overall, these expression variability analyses of public datasets, in additional to our granulocyte analysis presented here, confirm our conclusions and support the general nature of increased lncRNA natural expression variability compared to mRNAs.</p><p>Comparison of lncRNA and mRNA expression variability was performed as a small part of two previous studies. One LCL study analyzing splicing variability of protein-coding genes found a small number (183) of GENCODE lncRNAs with consistent higher expression variability than mRNAs, even in the absence of replicates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. The second study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] reported a similar relative impact of inter-tissue and inter-individual variability to total variance in gene expression for highly expressed (median RPKM &#x0003e;2.5 among 1,641 analyzed samples comprising 43 body sites from 175 individuals) GENCODE-v12 lncRNAs and mRNAs. This implies, given the known increased inter-tissue variability of lncRNAs, that inter-individual variability of lncRNAs is also greater in its absolute value than that of mRNAs. This study additionally reported enrichment of lncRNAs among genes showing differential expression between individuals of different populations. Thus, the findings from both these studies are consistent with our demonstration here of higher natural expression variation of lncRNAs compared to mRNAs.</p><p>High lncRNA inter-individual expression variability highlights another striking biology feature that distinguishes lncRNAs from mRNAs. The finding that expression variability is more prominent in new lncRNA loci and reduced in reference lncRNA annotations also indicates it can influence identification. Thus public annotations based on limited numbers of human donors or derived from single animal or plant inbred strains, may have reduced representation of variably expressed lncRNAs. We demonstrate this with the GEUVADIS LCL RNA-seq data derived from one cell type, by showing that adding more donors to the analysis identifies more lncRNA genes in the human genome. The number of lncRNA loci increased continuously, with novel lncRNA showing a more striking increase than known lncRNAs. The MiTranscriptome study that used a donor number per tissue comparable to our LCL analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] identified three-fold more novel lncRNAs than present in the three commonly used public databases (see above references). Our results also indicate that a granulocyte lncRNA annotation based on 10 donors, is most likely at the lower part of the donor saturation curve for this cell type. Moreover, our finding that the identification of novel lncRNA loci does not plateau even with 120 donors indicates that comprehensive annotation of lncRNAs in the human genome requires as many individuals as possible. The identification of high lncRNA intra- and inter-individual expression variability has implications for identifying lncRNAs and assessing their function and potential medical use. LncRNAs that lack consistent expression in some individuals are unlikely to be necessary for normal cell function, but may be functional in an age, environment, lifestyle, or disease related manner as shown for some protein-coding genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. At the same time, it cannot be assumed that a robustly expressed lncRNA has an important function in the cell type in which it is expressed. For example, the developmentally important <italic>Airn</italic> lncRNA retains robust expression after performing its silencing function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Our results support the view that functional studies require an understanding of basic lncRNA biology in different individuals before they can be interpreted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>].</p><p>The basis of increased inter-individual expression variation of lncRNAs relative to mRNAs is unknown. It may be relevant that, together with a lower conservation and faster evolution rate, human lncRNAs are recently evolved loci, harboring more SNPs than protein-coding genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. LncRNAs may also be more susceptible to environmental and lifestyle factors that contribute to mRNA expression variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Studies of protein-coding genes and lncRNAs in LCLs prepared from different population groups conclude that both expression strength and alternative splicing contribute to expression variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. How this contributes to differences in lncRNA and mRNA expression variability is not known. Bidirectional lncRNAs that likely share a promoter with a neighboring protein-coding gene are regulated similarly to neighboring protein-coding genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>] and we show that compared to intergenic or antisense lncRNAs, expression variability of bidirectional lncRNAs is more similar but still greater, than that of mRNAs. Inter-individual alternative splicing may contribute as some lncRNA loci display unusually high alternative splicing and variable exon structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. However, this is not supported by our observation that expression variation over the whole locus is similar to that of transcript isoforms. LncRNA genes are considered to be similar to mRNA genes as both are transcribed by RNAPII (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]). However, details of their promoters or enhancers that could explain the five non-mRNA-like features highlighted here (tight tissue-specificity, low expression, inefficient PolyA+ selection, inefficient splicing, and high inter-individual expression variation) have not yet been investigated. Some potential gene regulatory features (chromatin-modification patterns, splicing signals) are similar for lncRNAs and mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Some publications identified non-mRNA-like features in lncRNAs while others stress mRNA-like features, particularly of intergenic lncRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>] (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]). The analysis of healthy granulocytes presented here supports the view that a lncRNA subpopulation shows distinct non-mRNA-like features, which now includes high inter- and intra-individual expression variability. Non-mRNA-like features of lncRNAs may have use in their classification, as it is likely to be relevant for their function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. We show here that in healthy granulocytes only 40&#x000a0;% (2,490) of lncRNA transcripts are robustly expressed, while 17&#x000a0;% (1,069) of lncRNA transcripts show significant variable expression. The biological significance of robust or variable expression is not yet clear and both classes of lncRNAs may be useful for some studies. However, explanations of lncRNAs in terms of their evolution and function or proposals of their use as biomarkers or therapeutic targets first require an understanding of the robustness of their expression in healthy tissues.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We demonstrate here by analysis of human granulocyte RNA-seq data from multiple individuals that lncRNAs show unusually high natural expression variability compared to mRNAs. We use this dataset to generate a list of robustly and variably expressed granulocyte lncRNAs that will be of use in future applications. We also show that higher expression variability of lncRNAs is a general phenomenon inherent to diverse human tissues and cell lines that is of yet, unknown biological significance. High natural expression variability of lncRNAs, in addition to their tight tissue-specificity, low expression, inefficient PolyA+ selection, and inefficient splicing, identifies a set of five non-mRNA-like features that distinguish part of the lncRNA population from mRNAs and, also reduces their representation in reference annotations. We show that high inter-individual expression variability offers one explanation for the incomplete annotation of lncRNAs in many genomes. Our analysis shows that increasing the number of individuals analyzed will identify more lncRNA loci in the human genome, however, the donor number required is vastly in excess of that required for mRNAs. The finding of high expression variability of lncRNAs and its effect on identification provides novel guidelines for lncRNA annotation and additional considerations for design of functional studies and personalized medicine approaches.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec16"><title>Sample collection from healthy donors</title><p>Ten volunteers (five men, five women; age range: 27&#x02013;62 years) without obvious disease were recruited to donate blood.

We pooled the samples into five groups with a similar number of aligned spliced reads (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>I) and performed transcriptome assembly following the pipeline described for granulocytes. As the RNA-seq datasets were not strand-specific we used strand-specific PolyA+ RNA-seq of GM12878 from the ENCODE project (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>H) in the pipeline where needed. Quality assembly (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S24B) was assessed as for granulocytes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>GTEx RNA-seq data analysis</title><p>Aligned (as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]) RNA-seq data from the GTEx project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gtexportal.org/home/">http://www.gtexportal.org/home/</ext-link>) were downloaded from dbGaP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>) as described in (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gtexportal.org/static/misc/GTEx_Poster_CommunityMeeting_TY.pdf">http://www.gtexportal.org/static/misc/GTEx_Poster_CommunityMeeting_TY.pdf</ext-link>) after we applied and were granted data access. We downloaded RNA-seq data for nine tissues (namely lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL), adipose, artery, cerebellum, heart, lung, muscle, nerve, and thyroid), from 10 male and 10 female individuals each (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>J). The aligned RNA-seq datasets were unstranded and ranged from 14.8 to 85.4 (average 52.1) million paired-end reads each. We calculated RPKM of MiTranscriptome annotated multi-exonic lncRNAs and mRNAs in all samples and performed variability analysis between 20 individuals per tissue.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Donor saturation curve</title><p>One hundred and twenty out of 462 GEUVADIS RNA-seq samples containing more than 25 million reads were picked for the analysis from 12 unrelated women and men from each of the five population groups. A total of 25 million reads were randomly sampled from each RNA-seq sample using DownsampleSam.jar (Picard tools <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html#DownsampleSam">http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html#DownsampleSam</ext-link>). Donors were grouped into 30 groups each with two women plus two men from the same population and the reads from the four donors were pooled using MergeSamFiles.jar (Picard tools <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html#MergeSamFiles">http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html#MergeSamFiles</ext-link>) to produce 30&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;100 million read pools. Cufflinks was used to assemble a transcriptome from each pool (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Supplemental Methods) resulting in 30 transcriptome assemblies. Of these 30 assemblies, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30 assemblies were used to annotate <italic>de novo</italic> LCL transcriptomes from different number of donors (4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120, respectively) and to define the relation between the number of loci (Y axis) and the number of donors/assemblies (X axis). We randomly picked the needed number of assemblies from the list of 30. The random picking was performed three times for each number of assemblies (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S31B), except when all 30 assemblies were used for the last point.
