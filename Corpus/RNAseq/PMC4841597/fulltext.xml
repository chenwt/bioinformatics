GPR142 is a GPCR selectively activated by amino acids L-Tryptophan (L-Trp) and L-Phenylalanine with expression highly enriched in pancreatic islets in mouse and man [<xref rid="pone.0154452.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>](Lin et al., submitted) and was proposed to couple through Gq/11 signaling [<xref rid="pone.0154452.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. L-Trp and synthetic GPR142 agonists were reported to stimulate insulin secretion and improve glucose tolerance [<xref rid="pone.0154452.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], suggesting an important role of this receptor in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. However, in the only report examining GPR142 mediated Gq signaling published to date [<xref rid="pone.0154452.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], the receptor transcript (AB196529) was cloned from fetal brain and has a different predicted open reading frame from the transcript cloned from human pancreatic islets (XM_005257305.2)(Lin et al., submitted). Therefore, whether the GPR142 isoform expressed by islet cells couples through Gq bears reexamination. Furthermore, detailed studies of biological activities of this receptor, including potential signaling through additional G&#x003b1; subunits and the contributions of specific signaling pathways responsible for GPR142 agonists&#x02019; insulin secretagogue activities, have not been reported.</p><p>Insulin secretagogues such as sulfonylureas and glinides have been widely used to treat patients with type 2 diabetes, but can increase the risk of hypoglycemia since they trigger insulin release from pancreatic islets independent of ambient glucose levels [<xref rid="pone.0154452.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Glucose-dependent insulin secretagogue mechanisms, such as DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 analogs [<xref rid="pone.0154452.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], have emerged as preferred treatment alternatives due to their reduced hypoglycemic risk. As a novel insulin secretagogue mechanism, it is important to determine whether GPR142 agonists stimulate insulin secretion only in the presence of high ambient glucose, which is essential for a desired safety profile for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.</p><p>In this study, we performed a comprehensive survey of GPCR signaling pathways in a cell-based system using both L-Trp and a synthetic GPR142 agonist. We found GPR142 agonists activate both Gq and Gi-coupled signaling. While both Gq and Gi signaling contribute to GPR142-stimulated phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), only Gq is required for the dynamic mass redistributuion (DMR) signal observed upon GPR142 activation. Functional studies in pancreatic islets reveal that stimulation of insulin secretion by GPR142 activation is mediated through Gq-coupled signaling and strictly glucose-dependent. Together, our data indicate GPR142 agonism represents an attractive approach for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cell lines and G protein inhibitors</title><p>HEK293 cells obtained from ATCC were used to generate HEK293-human GPR142 and HEK293-mouse Gpr142 stable cell lines.

Animals were allowed ad libitum access to standard rodent chow and water. All animal procedures were approved by the HD Biosciences (Shanghai) and Covance Shanghai&#x02019;s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Animals were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation followed by subsequent cervical dislocation. Pancreatic islets were isolated by injection of collagenase XI solution (0.5 mg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich) into the common bile duct, excision of the pancreas, digestion at 37&#x000b0;C for 17 minutes, and Dextran density gradient separation. Isolated islets were cultured overnight in RPMI-1640 medium containing 11 mM glucose, 10% FBS, and 2 mM glutamine.

However, the requirement for Gq signaling in the function of the GPR142 transcript isoform expressed in pancreatic islets has not been definitively demonstrated by specific inhibitors of Gq function. Furthermore, whether GPR142 activation triggers intracellular calcium mobilization, a prototypic response of Gq signaling, is also unknown. To examine G protein-coupled signaling downstream of GPR142, we generated HEK293 cell lines overexpressing either human or mouse GPR142 and measured intracellular levels of D-myo-inositol 1-phosphate (IP-1), a downstream metabolite of D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP-3), in these cells. Both L-Tryptophan (L-Trp), a natural ligand for GPR142, and a synthetic and selective GPR142 agonist compound A (N-[(3-methylimidazol-4-yl)methyl]-1-[5-methyl-4-(2-thienyl)pyrimidin-2-yl]-5-propyl-pyrazole-4-carboxamide) [<xref rid="pone.0154452.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>](example 49), were able to trigger IP-1 accumulation after compound treatment for one hour in cells with heterologous expression of GPR142 but not in untransfected control HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154452.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Intriguingly, we were not able to detect significant intracellular calcium flux during acute GPR142 agonist treatment (&#x02264; 2 minutes) using the Fluorescent Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR) technology even at concentrations several orders of magnitude higher than what was sufficient to induce IP-1. Importantly, in the same cellular system the positive control adenosine triphosphate (ATP) elicited dose-dependent calcium flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154452.g002">Fig 2</xref>)[<xref rid="pone.0154452.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. To assess potential involvement of other G&#x003b1; subunits, including Gs and Gi, we measured intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. L-Trp or CpdA did not induce cAMP accumulation in GPR142-expressing cells in the absence of the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin (data not shown), while in the presence of forskolin, GPR142 activation by L-Trp or CpdA suppressed cAMP accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154452.g003">Fig 3</xref>). These data suggest that GPR142 activate Gi-coupled signaling but doesn&#x02019;t signal through Gs. We used specific inhibitors for Gq and Gi signaling to further examine pathways downstream of GPR142 activation. Addition of UBO-QIC (also known as FR900359), a cyclic depsipeptide isolated from <italic>Ardisia crenata</italic> that specifically inhibits Gq/11-coupled signaling events [<xref rid="pone.0154452.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], completely abolished IP-1 accumulation caused by L-Trp or CpdA in GPR142-expressing cells, while pretreatment of Pertussis toxin (PTX), a protein-based AB5-type exotoxin that catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation and inactivation of Gi subunits, did not significantly affect IP-1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154452.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Conversely, pretreatment with PTX blocked the ability of GPR142 agonists to suppress cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154452.g003">Fig 3</xref>).

Utilizing a Gq-specific inhibitor UBO-QIC, we provide definitive evidence that Gq signaling downstream GPR142 activation is responsible for IP accumulation, leads to ERK phosphorylation, mediates whole-cell changes manifested as a robust DMR signal, and is critically required for potentiation of glucose-dependent insulin secretion in pancreatic islets. In addition, we describe a novel finding that GPR142 agonists stimulate Gi signaling when the receptor is recombinantly expressed in HEK293 cells, which significantly contributes to ERK phosphorylation, but does not significantly impact whole-cell responses detected by DMR or affect GPR142&#x02019;s insulin secretagogue activity in pancreatic islets.</p><p>Activation of Gq subunits promotes phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated generation of second messengers diacylglycerol (DAG) and IP-3. DAG stimulates the activity of different isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC), while IP-3 triggers the release of calcium from endoplasmic reticulum stores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154452.g008">Fig 8</xref>). These signaling events in &#x003b2; cells upon activation of other GPCRs have been shown to play key roles in promoting insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner [<xref rid="pone.0154452.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Our findings that the insulin secretagogue activity of GPR142 agonists is only evident under high ambient glucose conditions and can be fully blocked by a Gq inhibitor are consistent with Gq coupling of the receptor. It is intriguing that GPR142 agonists induced robust IP accumulation but had minimal effect on calcium flux in the HEK293 cell system we used. It&#x02019;s possible that the kinetics of receptor signaling led to the different activities in these two assays, since we could only examine acute calcium fluxes with FLIPR technology, while the IP signal is allowed to accumulate over time after GPR142 agonist treatment. Alternatively, it&#x02019;s possible that calcium flux downstream of GPR142 activation integrates both Gq signaling and outputs of other pathways, leading to a net result of no overt increase in calcium in the cellular system we examined. There&#x02019;s precedence in the literature that Gi-coupled GPCRs could inhibit calcium currents through either G&#x003b1; or G&#x003b2;&#x003b3;-dependent mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0154452.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154452.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Further mechanistic exploration will be needed to better elucidate the signaling mechanisms of this receptor.</p><fig id="pone.0154452.g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0154452.g008</object-id><label>Fig 8</label><caption><title>Proposed model of GPR142 mediated signaling pathways in &#x003b2; cells.</title><p>Stimulation of GPR142 triggers activation of Gq signaling and IP-3 formation, which is critical for enhancement of glucose-dependent insulin secretion. Activation of GPR142 can also result in the activation of Gi and suppression of cAMP, the contribution of which to GPR142 function remains to be determined. Activation of both Gq and Gi signaling by GPR142 agonism result in the phosphorylation of ERK, which may contribute to the previously reported beneficial effects on &#x003b2; cell survival and/or proliferation for GPR142 agonists [<xref rid="pone.0154452.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0154452.g008"/></fig><p>The novel finding that GPR142 can also trigger Gi signaling is supported by the observation that, in the HEK293 cell system, GPR142 agonists suppress forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation, which in turn can be abrogated by the Gi inhibitor PTX. Further, PTX partially attenuates GPR142 agonists&#x02019; effects on ERK phosphorylation. However, whether Gi-coupled signaling plays a physiological role in GPR142 function in native cell types with endogenous expression of this receptor is unknown. In recombinant cell systems, the relative stoichiometry of receptor to G proteins may be different from that in native cells. Under conditions where the receptor is in excess, e.g. when overexpressed in a recombinant cell line, the formation of ternary complexes of the agonist-occupied receptor with additional heterotrimeric G proteins may be favored. In fact, it has been previously reported for various GPCRs that increases in receptor density can lead to cellular responses not found under conditions of lower receptor expression [<xref rid="pone.0154452.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition, the relative expression levels of various &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, and &#x003b3; subunits are cell type-dependent, resulting in different repertoires of heterotrimeric G proteins in different cell types. This may also have a significant impact on the formation of ternary complexes upon agonist-receptor binding. Indeed, 8 different &#x003b1; subunits of the Gi/Go class, as well as 5 &#x003b2; subunits and 12 &#x003b3; subunits have been described, altogether comprising a large number of possible heterotrimeric G proteins of the Gi/Go family [<xref rid="pone.0154452.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>It&#x02019;s also worth noting that recently reported cell type-specific RNAseq data from pancreatic islets suggest GPR142 mRNA is expressed in both &#x003b2; cells and non-&#x003b2; endocrine cells [<xref rid="pone.0154452.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Thus, it&#x02019;s formally possible that GPR142 activation could trigger Gi signaling in non-&#x003b2; cells, such as the Somatostatin-producing &#x003b4; cells, in turn having an indirect effect on &#x003b2; cell insulin secretion via intra-islet paracrine signaling. However, our data show the Gi inhibitor PTX does not affect the ability of GPR142 agonists to stimulate insulin secretion, clearly indicating that Gq signaling activity plays a predominant role in GPR142-mediated stimulation of insulin secretion in primary mouse islets. In addition to pancreatic islets, GPR142 transcript is also enriched in murine gastric ghrelin cells [<xref rid="pone.0154452.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Interestingly, several other nutrient-sensing GPCRs that couple to both Gq and Gi signaling, including Free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2/GPR43) and Free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFAR4/GPR120) were reported to preferentially couple to Gi in gastric ghrelin cells and suppress ghrelin secretion, potentially due to a high enrichment of several Gi/o subunits in this cell type [<xref rid="pone.0154452.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Whether the function of GPR142 in gastric ghrelin cells is mediated by Gi signaling remains to be determined, although a recent report showing L-Trp stimulating, rather than inhibiting, ghrelin secretion [<xref rid="pone.0154452.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] suggests GPR142-mediated Gi signaling may not account for this activity.</p><p>ERK phosphorylation has been linked to cell survival and proliferation in multiple cell types, including pancreatic &#x003b2; cells [<xref rid="pone.0154452.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0154452.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The receptor for the incretin hormone glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) was recently reported to promote &#x003b2; cell survival via phospho-ERK-dependent activation of Tcf1 [<xref rid="pone.0154452.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Our report is the first to demonstrate that GPR142 agonists induce ERK phosphorylation via both Gq- and Gi-dependent mechanisms. As GPR142 agonists have also been linked to potential beneficial effects on &#x003b2; cell health, including improved survival and increased proliferation in vitro [<xref rid="pone.0154452.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], it will be interesting to determine the role of the ERK phosphorylation, Tcf1, as well as contributions of Gq and Gi signaling to these effects.</p><p>In summary, our data indicate GPR142 agonism as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment diabetes has minimal risk for hypoglycemia. Moreover, cellular assays reflecting Gq signaling events as well as the whole-cell DMR assay may be used for high-throughput screening approaches. Further investigation of additional second messengers upon GPR142 activation may be warranted to delineate the signaling events responsible for the receptor&#x02019;s additional physiological functions and pharmacological potential.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Alexander M.
