However, it still remains unclear how and why proportions of reproductive pathways vary under different environmental stress conditions. We hypothesized that oxidative stress mediates alterations of developmental pathways. In apomictic plants we expected that megasporogenesis, the stage directly after meiosis, would be more affected than later stages of seed development. To simulate moderate stress conditions we subjected clone-mates of facultative apomictic <italic>Ranunculus auricomus</italic> to 10 h photoperiods, reflecting natural conditions, and extended ones (16.5 h). Reproduction mode was screened directly after megasporogenesis (microscope) and at seed stage (flow cytometric seed screening). Targeted metabolite profiles were performed with HPLC&#x02013;DAD to explore if and which metabolic reprogramming was caused by the extended photoperiod. Prolonged photoperiods resulted in increased frequencies of sexual vs. aposporous initials directly after meiosis, but did not affect frequencies of sexual vs. asexual seed formation. Changes in secondary metabolite profiles under extended photoperiods affected all classes of compounds, and c. 20% of these changes separated the two treatments. Unexpectedly, the renowned antioxidant phenylpropanoids and flavonoids added more to clone-mate variation than to treatment differentiation. Among others, chlorophyll degradation products, non-assigned phenolic compounds and more lipophilic metabolites also contributed to the dissimilarity of the metabolic profiles of plants that had been exposed to the two different photoperiods. The hypothesis of moderate light stress effects was supported by increased proportions of sexual megaspore development at the expense of aposporous initial formation. The lack of effects at the seed stage confirms the basic assumption that only meiosis and sporogenesis would be sensitive to light stress. The concomitant change of secondary metabolite profiles, as a systemic response at this early developmental stage, supports the notion that oxidative stress could have affected megasporogenesis by causing the observed metabolic reprogramming. Hypotheses of genotype-specific responses to prolonged photoperiods are rejected.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>apomixis</kwd><kwd>FCSS</kwd><kwd>light stress</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd><kwd><italic>Ranunculus</italic></kwd><kwd>reproduction mode</kwd><kwd>secondary metabolites</kwd><kwd>seed formation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001659</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">Ho 4359/1-1</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="76"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Sexual reproduction is common in eukaryotes compared to asexual reproduction, notwithstanding relatively high costs. Meiosis, the key step of eukaryotic sex, can break up favorable gene combinations; furthermore, sexual reproduction requires a mating partner (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Maynard Smith, 1978</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bell, 1982</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Otto, 2009</xref>). As yet, the benefits of sex are still not understood well. About 20 different hypotheses exist that attempt explaining the phenomenon (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Birdsell and Wills, 2003</xref>). One often voiced advantage for asexual reproduction is that favorable gene combinations can be transferred faithfully to the offspring (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Otto, 2009</xref>). Apomixis in plants, the asexual reproduction via seed, has evolved in many angiosperm lineages and occurs in nearly 300 genera (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.apomixis.uni-goettingen.de">http://www.apomixis.uni-goettingen.de</ext-link>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Hojsgaard et al., 2014b</xref>). Gametophytic apomixis reduces reproductive costs, because it combines the development of an embryo sac out of an unreduced cell of the ovule (apomeiosis) with the parthenogenetic development of the egg cell without fertilization (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Asker and Jerling, 1992</xref>). Nevertheless, also in apomictic plants sexual reproduction can occur within the same generation, which means that the reproduction mode is facultative (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Aliyu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Cosendai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Dobe&#x00161; et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Hojsgaard et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2014a</xref>).</p><p>It is still unclear which factors influence the frequency of sex in the facultative apomictic plants. In terms of a long-term effect, sexual production might help to eliminate deleterious mutations (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Muller, 1964</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000f6;randl, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Hojsgaard and H&#x000f6;randl, 2015</xref>), but robust hypotheses for a short-term benefit of sex are lacking still. The influence of various abiotic factors on flowering, such as temperature, length of the photoperiod, and drought stress, has been reported repeatedly (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Keller and K&#x000f6;rner, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Lokhande et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Sakai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Kurepin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Amasino, 2010</xref>). Experimental studies in several grass species provided evidence that a prolonged photoperiod leads to an increase in sexual embryo sac frequencies compared to apomeiotic ones (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Evans and Knox, 1969</xref>: <italic>Themeda</italic>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Gupta et al., 1969</xref>; <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Saran and Dewet, 1976</xref>: <italic>Dichantium</italic>; <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Quarin, 1986</xref>: <italic>Paspalum</italic>). These results concur with observations that different kinds of environmental stress can increase the proportion of sexual offspring in various asexual/sexual eukaryotes (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bernstein, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Nedelcu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">&#x00160;arhanov&#x000e1; et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Speijer et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The physiological background of these phenomena, however, is still unclear. In plants, asexual reproduction is heritable and under control of the same genes that regulate the sexual pathway. The reproductive phenotype is mostly determined by temporal or spatial de-regulation of genes acting during female reproduction (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Koltunow and Grossniklaus, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Grimanelli, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Galla et al., 2015</xref>). Variation in meiotic vs. apomeiotic embryo sac formation was suggested to be caused by dosage-effects of apomeiosis-controlling alleles and hence seems to be genotype-specific (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Ozias-Akins and Van Dijk, 2007</xref>). The second step of reproduction, i.e., fertilization vs. parthenogenetic development of the egg cell, is under independent genetic control (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Ozias-Akins and Van Dijk, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Grimanelli, 2012</xref>). In facultative apomicts, proportions of functional megaspores, meiotically formed embryo sacs and finally sexually formed seeds can differ significantly within the same clone, implicating that also other processes influence gametogenesis and seed formation (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Hojsgaard et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2014a</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Hojsgaard and H&#x000f6;randl, 2015</xref>).</p><p>A causal explanation for stress-dependent variation of reproduction modes, and for stage-specific stress-sensitivity, is still missing. So far, expression studies of female gametophytes of apomictic <italic>Boechera</italic> species, a close relative to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, revealed changes in the expression patterns of several hundred genes when sexual development switches to apomixis. The majority of transcripts comprised metabolism and developmental genes besides transcription factors with strongly stage-specific expression profiles (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Sharbel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et al., 2014</xref>). The <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et al. (2014)</xref> study specifically points out that genes that are involved in the biosynthesis of spermidine and other polyamines are more expressed in the apomictic gametophyte. Polyamines can affect gene expression, cell proliferation, modulation of cell signaling, the permeability of certain ion channels and membrane stabilization. Polyamines are not only essential for growth but are involved in responses to stress and various diseases (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Kusano et al., 2008</xref>). Accordingly, <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et al. (2014)</xref> argue that this enhanced accumulation of polyamine might result in better protection against oxidative stress. In flower buds of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and many other plants, the predominant identified secondary (specialized) metabolites are phenylpropanoid polyamine conjugates (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Fellenberg et al., 2009</xref>). Facultative sexual reproduction in apomictic angiosperms might be affected by oxidative stress in the ovule. An extended photoperiod can cause photo-oxidative stress (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Foyer et al., 1994</xref>). The oxidative stress initiation hypothesis (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000f6;randl and Hadacek, 2013</xref>) posits that oxidative stress could activate meiosis-specific proteins that initiate double strand break formation and thus increase recombination frequency. Presently and before, suggestions have been voiced that meiotic sex might represent a cellular survival strategy (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bernstein et al., 1988</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bernstein, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000f6;randl and Hadacek, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Speijer et al., 2015</xref>). This hypothesis influenced the design of this study decisively. Just like all other aerobic organisms, plants depend on mechanisms that contribute to mitigating of the potential damage caused by the enzymatic and non-enzymatic overproduction of highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) by various forms of abiotic and biotic stress in attempts to protect the integrity of essential organelles, mitochondria, chloroplasts and peroxisomes representing those most endangered. ROS, such as superoxide anion, O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02022;-</sup>, hydroxyl radical, <sup>&#x02022;</sup>OH, hydrogen peroxide, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and singlet oxygen, <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, have to be considered not only as pure toxic cellular stress by-products but as important signaling components that can regulate various metabolic activities (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Fujita et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Following those studies reporting that an irregular prolonged photoperiod increases the frequency of sexually formed embryo sacs in facultative apomictic grass species, a similar experimental setup was designed for the facultative apomictic herb <italic>Ranunculus auricomus</italic>. The <italic>Ranunculus auricomus</italic> complex (<italic>R. auricomus</italic> agg.) is a suitable and well-established model system for exploring reproduction modes and the mechanisms that trigger evolution of sex and apomixis (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Nogler, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000f6;randl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Pellino et al., 2013</xref>). The complex comprises diploid sexual and polyploid facultative apomictic taxa that colonize a broad range of habitats between the arctic zone and the Mediterranean (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Jalas and Suominen, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000f6;randl et al., 2009</xref>). The apomeiotic embryo sac development in <italic>R. auricomus</italic> starts from an unreduced somatic cell in the nucellus (apospory) while in the sexual pathway meiosis produces a megaspore tetrad, from which the functional megaspore develops into a reduced embryo sac. In both cases, the mature embryo sac is of the 7-celled, 8-nucleate <italic>Polygonum</italic> type which is typical for the majority of angiosperms (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Nogler, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Hojsgaard et al., 2014a</xref>). The unreduced egg cell develops parthenogenetically into an embryo, which is a clone of the mother plant. However, fertilization of polar nuclei by sperm cells is necessary for proper endosperm formation and development of functional seed (pseudogamy; e.g., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Izmai&#x00142;ow, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000f6;randl, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Hojsgaard et al., 2014a</xref>).</p><p>Three different clonal progenies derived from the hexaploid (allopolyploid) natural hybrid <italic>Ranunculus carpaticola &#x000d7; cassubicifolius</italic> were investigated in the present experiment. This apomictic hybrid lineage has been naturally originated from the sexual diploid progenitor <italic>Ranunculus carpaticola</italic> So&#x000f3;, distributed in the Carpathians, and the sexual autotetraploid <italic>Ranunculus cassubicifolius</italic> W. Koch from the northern-pre-Alps, during a hybridization event with subsequent genome duplication c. 70,000 years ago (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Paun et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Pellino et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Hojsgaard et al., 2015</xref>) and is known for facultative sexual/apomictic reproduction (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Hojsgaard et al., 2014a</xref>). The higher frequencies of facultative sexuality in <italic>R. auricomus</italic> compared to <italic>Boechera</italic> (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Aliyu et al., 2010</xref>), even under standard conditions, turn <italic>Ranunculus</italic> into a highly suitable model system for studying reproduction mode variation. Aposporous apomictic species can differ in their response to environmental factors (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Houliston et al., 2006</xref>). Consequently, we investigated clonal progenies from three different genotypes (and source populations) from the same hybrid lineage. To entangle effects of prolonged photoperiods on apomeiosis and parthenogenesis, we analyzed mode of reproduction at two developmental stages, directly after megasporogenesis and at the seed stage. Under assumptions of the oxidative stress initiation hypothesis we would expect an effect of oxidative stress mainly during and directly after meiosis, resulting in increased proportions of functional megaspores.</p><p>Concomitantly, a targeted metabolomics analysis (HPLC&#x02013;DAD) of phenolic metabolites in flower buds at the megasporogenesis stage was aimed at exploring (1) if the differing photoperiod treatment affected the patterns of detectable metabolites, and (2) if increased accumulation of a specific metabolite class or subclass of secondary, or as they are lately called, specialized metabolites, correlated with the treatment adding evidence to their suspected contribution as antioxidants to increased stress tolerance (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Nakabayashi and Saito, 2015</xref>). For this purpose, the sole acquisition of UV spectra can be sufficient because it specifically allows detecting phenolic metabolites including the previously mentioned phenylpropanoid polyamine conjugates (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Fellenberg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">G&#x000f3;mez-Romero et al., 2010</xref>), all of which are renown <italic>in vitro</italic> antioxidants (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Nakabayashi and Saito, 2015</xref>). Furthermore, the metabolic profiling was to explore (3) how the extent of reproductive phenotype switching compares to the detectable metabolic reprogramming. The targeted metabolic profiling detects many more metabolites besides phenolics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant Material and Genotyping</title><p>Clone-mates of three populations were used for the experiment, i.e., offspring from three apomictically reproducing hexaploid <italic>Ranunculus carpaticola &#x000d7; cassubicifolius</italic> mother plants (originally collected from three sites in the western Carpathians, Slovakia, see Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>) was raised from seeds (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000f6;randl, 2008</xref>).

Genotyping of clonal progeny was performed with nuclear microsatellite primers derived from an RNAseq dataset (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Pellino et al., 2013</xref>). Loci including simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were detected using the program SciRoKo (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Kofler et al., 2007</xref>), and amplified using PCR-primers (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S2</xref>) constructed in Primer3 (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Untergasser et al., 2007</xref>). Leaves were sampled and dried in silica gel before DNA extraction with a DNeasy-96 Plant Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations. Multiplex PCR reactions were conducted in 25 &#x003bc;l reaction volumes containing: BIOMIX (12.5 &#x003bc;l); 10 &#x003bc;M F primer (0.2 &#x003bc;l); 10 &#x003bc;M R primer (1.0 &#x003bc;l); HEX or FAM CAG-Primer (1.0 &#x003bc;l); 1.0 &#x003bc;l of template DNA. Primers and all other PCR reagents were provided from Eurofins MWG Operon (Ebersberg, Germany). PCR reaction was conducted in BioRad T100<sup>TM</sup> Thermal Cycler under following conditions: initial denaturation 94&#x000b0;C/10 min; 14 &#x000d7; [denaturation 94&#x000b0;C/60 s; annealing 62&#x000b0;C+0.5&#x000b0;C per Cycle 90 s; extension 72&#x000b0;C/60 s]; 35 &#x000d7; [denaturation 94&#x000b0;C/30 s, annealing 55&#x000b0;C/30 s, extension 72&#x000b0;C/30 s]; final extension 72&#x000b0;C/60 s; and storage at 4&#x000b0;C. PCR products were diluted in order to equalize their concentrations and mixed (volumes per line) with 85 &#x003bc;l Formamide (HiDi) and 0.7 &#x003bc;l size standard (GENSCAN 500 ROX; Applied Biosystems), denatured for 3 min at 92&#x000b0;C, and run on an automatic capillary sequencer Genetic Analyzer 3130 (ABI PRISM). Electropherograms were scored with GeneMarkerV2.4.2 (SoftGenetics LLC) and exported as binary matrix of presence/absence of alleles to characterize multilocus genotypes. Since up to six alleles occurred in some loci within a genotype, we could not identify allele dosage configurations in detail. The SSR profiles were subjected to neighbor-joining analysis (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>) based on Jaccard similarity index in FAMD (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Schlueter and Harris, 2006</xref>).

The resulting tree was visualized in FigTree v1.4.2 (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Rambaut, 2009</xref>). This study ascertained that the three progenies cluster together and represent each maternal genotypes. Most individuals of one progeny (clone-mates) shared identical genotypes, only one to three individuals per clone had slightly different genotypes derived from SSR allele variants (see Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>). Voucher specimens were deposited after the experiment in the herbarium of the University of G&#x000f6;ttingen (GOET).</p></sec><sec><title>Growth Chamber Setup</title><p>Preliminary experiments revealed that exposure to winter conditions is essential for flower induction. By end of February 2014, sprouting plants were transferred into growth chambers. From each clone eight clone-mates were grown with 10 h photoperiod (control plants) and 16 h photoperiod (stress treatment), respectively (see also Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>). The treatment group received an additional short photoperiod of 0.5 h in the middle of the dark period to increase stress (16.5 h). These conditions were chosen based on preliminary experiments in attempts to assess the ideal photosynthetically active photon flux density (PPFD) and photoperiod duration conditions that still facilitated unimpeded floral and seed development of the <italic>R. auricomus</italic> clones in the available climate chambers. We refrained from varying light intensities for two reasons: first, the plants are forest understory plants, and hence pre-adapted to rather low light intensities; second, the technical conditions of the climate chambers limited our options of optimizing light intensities. The presented experiment was performed in climate chambers that were equipped with conventional gaseous discharge lamp technology. Its well-known disadvantages for plant culture, such as the inability to control the wavelength spectrum and the high radiant heat emission when delivering high light intensities, amongst others, also applied to this study. As a consequence, the available conditions had to be modified such that the treatment and control plants were still in sufficient good conditions to allow performing the measurement of all desired parameters.</p><p>The temperature was kept constant at 18&#x000b0;C in both chambers and relative humidity was set at 60%. The PPFD, photoactive radiation (PAR) in a more wide sense, was c. 250 &#x003bc;mol m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> (measured at shoot tips). The used light intensities reflect those in the understory and margins of forests, the natural habitat of the clone mother plants in Slovakia (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Paun et al., 2006a</xref>). The control photoperiod was set a bit shorter than the natural day length of 12 h at the end of March/begin of April, because the technical setup of the chambers with conventional plant growth lamps did not allow the simulation of natural dusk and dawn periods with lower light intensity and changing wavelength spectra. To delimit radiation to the predominant stress factor, we instead increased photoperiod differences between stress and control. The plants grew in 31 plastic containers in conventional garden soil and were rotated regularly within chambers.</p></sec><sec><title>Sporogenesis, Apospory, and Embryo Sac Development</title><p>Ovules were screened for the abundance of aposporous initial cells and functional meiotic megaspores (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Hojsgaard et al., 2014a</xref>).

This was further confirmed by a Mantel test which revealed no significant correlation of genetic vs. secondary metabolite diversity among clones (<italic>P</italic> = 0.9) which is illustrated by a graphical plot of genetic distance vs. dissimilarity of secondary metabolites (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study provides considerable evidence for a similar effect of photoperiod extension on reproduction mode in <italic>R. auricomus</italic> as revealed by the few previous studies carried out with grasses, specifically a slight increase in sexual ovule formation (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Knox, 1967</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Evans and Knox, 1969</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Gupta et al., 1969</xref>; <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Saran and Dewet, 1976</xref>; <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Quarin, 1986</xref>). The light intensity in the chambers matched roughly outdoor light conditions in shaded or half shaded habitats typical for natural populations. The extended photoperiod in the stress treatment (16 h plus 0.5 h night break) was designed to simulate a moderate light stress, all other environmental factors being kept equal. Too extensive stress could cause strong detrimental effects. This effect can especially occur if radical-producing chemicals are infiltrated into the tissue. For instance, a study that applied this approach claimed that oxidative stress negatively correlates with meiosis in maize anthers (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Kelliher and Walbot, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The facultative apomictic/sexual <italic>Ranunculus</italic> plants produced altogether significantly more sexual ovules with 16.5 h photoperiod compared to the 10 h light treatment. A similar effect was observed in facultative apomictic tetraploid <italic>Paspalum cromyorrhizon</italic> plants, where a prolonged photoperiod (14 h compared to 12 h) enhanced the percentage of ovules with embryo sac development from a reduced functional megaspore (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Quarin, 1986</xref>). The authors assumed the light regime to be one of the environmental factors that influences reproduction mode in facultative apomictic/sexual <italic>Paspalum</italic>. In contrast to <italic>Paspalum</italic>, an evaluation of the percentage of sexual ovules at a later stage (mature embryo sac during flowering) was not possible via microscopy as in the genus <italic>Ranunculus</italic> ovules do not show multiple embryo sacs, and mature aposporous and sexual embryo sacs are phenotypically identical (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Hojsgaard et al., 2014a</xref>).</p><p>The higher percentage of sexual ovules in the stressed plants resulted in a slightly higher mean frequency of sexual seeds compared to control plants, but the difference was not significant. <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Houliston et al. (2006)</xref> studied the influence of the photoperiod on the reproductive mode of facultative apomictic <italic>Hieracium pilosella</italic> and found no significant difference between a 14 and 16 h treatment in the germination rates of seeds. The results suggest that light stress just increased frequencies of functional megasporogenesis in <italic>R. auricomus</italic>, but had no direct effect on later embryo sac formation and seed development. But, a striking decrease of sexuality was observed between ovule and seed stage. The frequency of sexual ovules was twice as high as the frequency of sexual seeds in both light regimes. A strong decline of the proportions of functional megaspores to proportions of well-developed embryo sacs, and finally to sexually formed seeds occurred also in the hexaploids of <italic>R. auricomus</italic> cultivated under equal garden conditions, while in diploid sexual species these proportions remained at the same level between the developmental stages (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Hojsgaard et al., 2014a</xref>). A similar decline of sexual development between the developmental stages was observed by <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Hojsgaard et al. (2013)</xref> in apomictic <italic>Paspalum malacophyllum</italic>. In <italic>R. auricomus</italic>, aborting vs. functional phenotypes of sexual embryo sacs can be well-observed by microscopic investigation at the early stages (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Hojsgaard et al., 2014a</xref>). The (2n) aposporous embryo sac development seems faster than the (n) meiotic one after the appearance and growth of one or several unreduced aposporous initial cell(s) simultaneously to the functional reduced megaspore in ovules where both pathways are functional. Survival of the aposporous sacs and abortion of the meiotic ones then results in higher frequencies of apomictic seeds. The decline of reduced megaspores/gametophytes can be enhanced by expression of deleterious recessive mutations in the growing gametophyte, resulting in abortion, while in unreduced gametophytes, recessive mutations would be masked (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Hojsgaard and H&#x000f6;randl, 2015</xref>). This trend seems to be recurrent for facultative apomictic species, where the asexual pathway often prevails probably due to the genetic or epigenetic disorders causing asynchronous development on the sexual pathway after activation of apomixis (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Hojsgaard et al., 2013</xref>). As a consequence, possibly in our study the decline between the relative proportions of sexual megaspore formation to sexual seeds is influenced more by the competitive capacity of the apomictic pathway rather than by the light regime during gametogenesis and seed development. This supports the oxidative stress initiation hypothesis (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000f6;randl and Hadacek, 2013</xref>) which predicts that light stress affects only female meiosis, but has not relevant effects on further ovule and seed development.</p><p>All three progenies showed a considerable variation among clone-mates in frequencies of megasporogenesis vs. apospory. This result strongly supports epigenetic and transcriptional control mechanisms as the background for the phenotypic expression of apospory (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Grimanelli, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et al., 2014</xref>). Allelic dosage effects as observed in Mendelian genetic studies (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Nogler, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Ozias-Akins and Van Dijk, 2007</xref>) obviously can be modulated by environmental influence. Methylation-based epigenetic variation does exist in genetically identical clone-mates and is sensitive to environmental stress, as shown in <italic>Taraxacum</italic> (<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Verhoeven et al., 2010</xref>). A possible contribution of secondary metabolites in this modulation of reproductive pathways is indirectly supported from gene expression studies. Transcriptome profiles of flowering buds of <italic>Hypericum perforatum</italic> revealed that most GO terms of differentially expressed genes between sexual and aposporous accessions were related to stress response, biotic and abiotic stimuli, DNA metabolic profiles, and signal transduction, but also to carbohydrate and lipid metabolic profiles, and to secondary metabolites (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Galla et al., 2015</xref>). Strikingly, even cell-specific transcriptome profiles of laser-microdissected aposporous initials in <italic>Boechera gunnisoniana</italic>, compared to sexual <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, revealed that several regulatory pathways differ between sexual and aposporous germlines, including also enrichment of spermidine and polyamine pathways (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>Ranunculus</italic> a comprehensive gene expression profiling is not yet feasible due to the lack of an annotated reference genome (see <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Pellino et al., 2013</xref>). In this respect, this study attempts as a first step to find a covariance between mode of reproduction and secondary metabolite profiles under stress conditions.</p><p>Numerous studies document that secondary or specialized plant metabolites, especially phenolic ones, possess antioxidant properties <italic>in vivo</italic> and are thus associated with the plant&#x02019;s response to abiotic stress (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Tohge et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Nakabayashi and Saito, 2015</xref>). In context with the oxidative damage hypothesis for meiosis, an assessment of such metabolite profiles in buds that have been formed on plants exposed to photoperiods of different length represented a feasible methodological approach to detect potential changes caused by the potentially resulting oxidative stress. ROS are usually short-lived but can cause complex tissue-wide oxidation when they are formed excessively and trigger uncontrolled oxidative chain reactions (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000f8;ller et al., 2007</xref>). As a result of the increased oxidation, the profiles of detectable metabolites were expected to show notable changes. These can be caused either by the formation of novel structures (oxidation products or novel biosynthesis) or loss due to polymerization resulting in non-detectable products. The investigated accessions comprised each four individuals from the three clones I, T, and V. In terms of detectable metabolites, the phenotypic variation within the three investigated clones was notable. Only three individuals in one clone (I) showed 80% similarity. These results support the hypothesis that this variation might be caused by epigenetic mechanisms as a consequence of variable micro-conditions which have to be expected when plants were grown in garden and not in growth chamber conditions. Exposure to winter frost conditions, however, was mandatory to obtain flowering plants in spring. Despite this unavoidable heterogeneity&#x02014;all plants were of the same age and always kept in the same location before the experiment&#x02014;the extended photoperiod still changed significantly the metabolite patterns (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref></bold>). If one takes a look at different metabolite classes (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B&#x02013;E</xref></bold>), their single contributions vary. Chlorophyll degradation products (Chl) provide a highly significant contribution to the two photoperiod treatments (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref></bold>); this is not unexpected as chlorophyll degradation is an oxidation process (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000f6;rtensteiner, 2006</xref>). We suppose that the photosynthetically active green sepals of the buds were the major affected tissue that responded to the stress that was caused by the extension of the photoperiod. The contribution of carotenoids (Ca) was not significant (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref></bold>). These metabolites cause the yellow color of the petals (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Grotewold, 2006</xref>). Consequently, their detectability could be low because of the early developmental stage of the petals in the buds, which could have varied between and within clones. Moreover, petals are often more or less aborted in apomictic <italic>R. auricomus</italic> plants (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000f6;randl et al., 2009</xref>). Phenylpropanoid acids (C) and flavonoids (F) did not add to the treatment group separation which somehow contradicts their attributed reputation as antioxidants (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Nakabayashi and Saito, 2015</xref>). Similar to carotenoids, they might not yet be expressed at this early bud stage. Conversely, they added to variation within the single accessions that received the same photoperiod treatment, though (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref></bold>). A highly significant contribution, however, was added by non-assigned phenolic compounds (P, <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref></bold>). Some could represent conjugates with other stress-related metabolites, such as phenylpropanoid polyamine conjugates (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Fellenberg et al., 2009</xref>). The retention times of identified phenylpropanoids, however, suggest more the presence of non-conjugated phenylpropanoids. Unfortunately, many of these conjugates have been identified previously in strict LC&#x02013;MS analyses, in which reporting of UV spectral data is usually omitted in contrast to reports on novel isolated plant metabolites. The more lipophilic group of phenolic metabolites (LP, <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref></bold>) was comprised of mostly unknowns. It is well-known that the various forms of environmental stress can also induce or enhance non-phenolic secondary metabolites (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Ramakrishna and Ravishankar, 2011</xref>). In this context, it was not totally unexpected that the last group, the aliphatic and more saturated metabolites (A, <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref></bold>), contributed to the dissimilarity of the treatment groups similarly to the LP group. As the previously discussed group, A is also heterogeneous and most probably comprised of terpenoids, most likely of variously oxidized sesqui-, triterpenes, oxylipins, or oxidized fatty acid degradation products. The initial hypothesis predicted that the extended photoperiod predominantly affects the presumed antioxidants, cinnamic acids (C) and flavonoids (F). A lot of attention is paid to flavonoid and other phenols due to their diversity, ubiquity and documented <italic>in vitro</italic> bioactivity (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Buer et al., 2010</xref>) in assumptions that the activity is mainly antioxidant (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Nakabayashi and Saito, 2015</xref>). Other studies, however, point to the fact that anti- and pro-oxidant activities depend both on electron availability and metal catalysts of these electron transfers and are thus highly locally milieu-dependent (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chobot et al., 2013</xref>). Substantial experimental evidence points to the fact that the cellular redox signaling hub interacts complexly with the hormone signaling network at multiple levels, which synergistically not only controls plant growth and development but also modulates response to environmental stress (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Considine and Foyer, 2014</xref>). However, only few components of this complex system are understood so far. Furthermore, the results obtained in this study point to a more systemic than a linear deterministic nature of the involved processes, in which specific quantitative changes of metabolite concentrations fail to explain the overall observed effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We confirmed the hypothesis that a prolonged photoperiod, as a moderate environmental stress, can increase frequencies of ovules with functional megaspores of facultative apomictic plants, but it can fail affecting the seed development. The stress response in flowering buds is accompanied by changes of secondary metabolite profiles. These were not caused by the reputedly antioxidant flavonoids and phenylpropanoids, which might not yet be expressed at this early stage, but by unidentified phenols and other, partially non-phenolic compound classes. Potentially, oxidative stress, as a systemic response specific for the early developmental stage, could have affected megasporogenesis. So far, no comparative gene expression study is available on stress response of sexual and apomictic plants, or of facultative apomictic plants. In preparation of such more extensive investigations, this study confirmed the assumed covariance of modes of reproduction and of changes of secondary metabolite profiles under a controlled experimental setup for the <italic>R. auricomus</italic> model system, which represents the first herbal plant species ever investigated in this context.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>SK, FH, and EH conceived and designed the study.
