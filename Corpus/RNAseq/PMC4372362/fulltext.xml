Its molecular function has been hypothesized to be related to anti-apoptosis and the proliferation of immune cells. The Trojan gene has been localized onto the Z sex chromosome. The adjacent two genes also show significant homology to Trojan, suggesting the existence of a novel gene/protein family. Here, we characterize this Trojan family, identify homologues in other species and predict evolutionary constraints on these genes. The two Trojan-related proteins in chicken were predicted as a receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase and a transmembrane protein, bearing a cytoplasmic immuno-receptor tyrosine-based activation motif. We identified the Trojan gene family in ten other bird species and found related genes in three reptiles and a fish species. The phylogenetic analysis of the homologues revealed a gradual diversification among the family members. Evolutionary analyzes of the avian genes predicted that the extracellular regions of the proteins have been subjected to positive selection. Such selection was possibly a response to evolving interacting partners or to pathogen challenges. We also observed an almost complete lack of intracellular positively selected sites, suggesting a conserved signaling mechanism of the molecules. Therefore, the contrasting patterns of selection likely correlate with the interaction and signaling potential of the molecules.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Finnish Cultural Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.skr.fi/en">https://www.skr.fi/en</ext-link>), Central Fund (grant number 00110693); and Oulu University Hospital (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ppshp.fi/">http://www.ppshp.fi/</ext-link>) (VTR funding, project number K32737).

Driven by a constant need to adapt to novel pathogen challenges, genes of the immune system are often forced to evolve faster compared to other genes [<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. As a result, a number of immune system genes and the proteins they encode display variability that is currently among the highest known in animal species [<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>In jawed vertebrates, the immune system can be divided into innate, which presents the first line of host defense and adaptive, which provides a more sophisticated means of fighting pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Positive Darwinian selection has been described for a variety of genes associated with adaptive immunity, among which are the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules [<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) [<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and the common leukocyte antigen, CD45 [<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Also, signatures of positive selection have been shown for genes associated with innate immunity, like the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 1 family [<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], TLR4 and TLR7 [<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Evidence of positive selection has been found for other genes, associated with both innate and adaptive immunity, such as chemokine receptors [<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], interleukins (IL) and IL receptors [<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, in other instances, genes related to host defense have been shown to be highly conserved. This is likely a result of negative purifying selection acting to eliminate deleterious mutations in molecules that need to stay unchanged. Such is the case of C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), which has a conserved conformation [<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and the common gamma chain (&#x003b3;c) of IL receptors [<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which acts as a hub protein to other associating receptor chains.</p><p>The molecular tools of host defense involve a variety of proteins many of which are already known, while others are yet to be discovered. Aiming to identify novel proteins related to the immune system, we cloned a previously unknown chicken (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>) protein from an embryonic day 13 (E13) thymus cDNA library. The molecule is a leukocyte-specific, cell surface protein that we named "Trojan" and characterized previously [<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The tissue distribution of its transcript closely follows that of CD45, while the protein is found on the surface of lymphocyte subpopulations and macrophages. Based on our detailed analysis of developing thymocytes, we hypothesized an anti-apoptotic and/or proliferative function for Trojan.</p><p>The cloned Trojan cDNA is about 2.1 Kb, with coding DNA sequence (CDS) of about 1.5 Kb. It translates to a 494 amino acids long, type I transmembrane protein that is likely to be glycosylated. The extracellular part of Trojan is predicted to have a signal peptide, followed by a complement control protein (CCP) domain and a pair of fibronectin type III (FN3) domains. The cytoplasmic tail of Trojan is short and has a region of four positively charged amino acids and two putative serine phosphorylation sites.</p><p>As described previously, Trojan nucleotide sequence was mapped to the Z sex chromosome of the chicken genome [<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, we also found the gene on BAC clone CH261&#x02013;99K12, which contained the complete and uninterrupted Trojan sequence. The neighboring upstream and downstream genes were shown to be highly homologous to Trojan and we therefore suggested the existence of a novel Trojan gene/protein family.</p><p>In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the Trojan gene family in chicken and other avian and non-avian species. The recent advances in the chicken genome assembly and gene annotations (Galgal4), allowed us to identify the proteins coded by the two Trojan-related genes. With the rapid accumulation of genomic sequence data from numerous species, we also found homologous sequences in ten other avian species, as well as three reptiles and West Indian ocean coalecanth fish. Since the majority of these genome assemblies were in the form of separate scaffolds, we performed manual scaffold assembly and gene modeling. Obtaining the predicted Trojan-like genes allowed us to perform phylogenetic analyzes of the family members and determine the pattern of evolutionary selection they have been subjected to. We found strong evidence of positive Darwinian selection mostly in the extracellular domain, while other parts of the proteins appeared to be under purifying negative selection. These contrasting evolutionary patterns likely correlate with the role of the protein domains and cytoplasmic tails.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Trojan gene family in chicken</title><p>The Trojan gene sequence is found on chicken chromosome Z in the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) genome database.

We made extensive characterization of their deduced protein sequences, identified the family in other avian species and found related genes in non-avian species. We analyzed the phylogenetic relationship between the family members, estimated gene conversion events and dated one gene duplication. We have also determined patterns of evolutionary selection that have operated on the genes and identified co-evolving amino acid networks.</p><p>In chicken, the high expression of <italic>Mystran</italic>, <italic>Trojan</italic> and <italic>Thracian</italic> genes in macrophages is in consent with the previously reported tissue distribution of Trojan [<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Trojan is a leukocyte-specific molecule and we can expect the other family members to be related to immune system function, as well. Detailed tissue expression analyzes of the family will be among the primary objectives of our further studies.</p><p>Chicken <italic>Mystran</italic>, <italic>Trojan</italic> and <italic>Thracian</italic> code for surface proteins with CCP and FN3 domains within their extracellular regions. Such domain types are known to mediate molecular associations in <italic>cis</italic>, <italic>trans</italic> or in a combined fashion, as has been shown for the IL-2 receptor complex [<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Hence, the extracellular topology of the Trojan protein family suggests an ability for interaction with other cell surface partners or ligands. These domains were also found in the proteins from the other avian and non-avian species, implying their functional importance. The proposed ability for protein-interaction is further supported by the presence of extracellular ID binding sites. Like in the case of the immune-related CD44, many ID regions are extracellular [<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; they are also believed to mediate protein interactions and often represent flexible areas between domains [<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Indeed, we identified the ID binding sites mainly within regions where no known domains were predicted to exist. Therefore, the ID regions may complement the molecular function of the CCP and FN3 domains or have a role on their own in the process of protein binding.</p><p>The Trojan family members have similar extracellular regions, but dissimilar intracellular parts, that bear signatures of signaling potential. The pair of PTP domains in Mystran outlines the molecule as the only family member capable of direct catalytic activity. The overlapping cytoplasmic SFM of Trojan indicate an indirect signaling potential of the molecule via the association of intracellular partners. Among the cytoplasmic SFM of Thracian was an ITAM, a commonly found motif in transmembrane proteins of the immune system [<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The short ID binding region next to it, may mediate the functional interactions of the motif with other molecules [<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Considering the presence of Thracian transcript in macrophages, the ITAM makes us further suspect a role of it related to immunity. Overall, these data indicate that the Trojan family members have potential for protein interactions and downstream signaling. The SFM hint towards possible intracellular partners of Mystran, Trojan and Thracian that represent an intriguing aspect of our further studies. The nature of such interactions, the triggered cytoplasmic cascades and their cellular role are yet to be elucidated experimentally. The prediction of the same SFM in avian species other than chicken highlights the potential functional importance of the molecules.</p><p>In our ML analyzes, the family members from reptiles and fish naturally formed an outgroup, helping us root the tree. Although we found homologues in the coalecanth, we were unable to find related genes in other fish, like <italic>D</italic>. <italic>rerio</italic>. Considering that the coalecanth is evolutionarily close to reptiles [<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], we could expect the genes to have come into existence after the emergence of ray-finned fish. Our searches however, did not identify homologous sequences in <italic>X</italic>. <italic>tropicalis</italic>, which could be due to an incompletion of the sequences databases at the time the searches were done. No evidence of the family in mammals was found, suggesting a gene loss. The reasons behind such an event, as well as the identification of possible functionally-related genes in mammals are intriguing targets for our future analyzes.</p><p>Most of the avian orthologues grouped into three separate clusters, as was expected. The two major clusters of Trojans and Thracian are likely a result of a recent duplication in birds. However, the orthologs do not exactly recapitulate the species tree [<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and some appear similar to another family member from the same species. This is likely a result of gene conversions and as our data showed, such events have indeed occurred in several species. The most notable conversion was the one between Mystran and Trojan in chicken, which accounts for the remarkably high similarity between their extracellular regions. As a result, this placed the two genes next to each other in the tree, instead of their respective clusters. Therefore, the phylogenetic tree is a mix of gene duplication and gene conversion which results in its overall ladder-like shape.</p><p>If the gene conversion between <italic>Mystran</italic> and <italic>Trojan</italic> has provided a functional advantage, the benefit would have stemmed from the partial identity between the two proteins. This raises the intriguing possibility that the extracellular regions of Trojan and Mystran may be capable of associating with the same partner. Such interaction may result in a partner-binding competition and may represent a means of functional regulation of the molecules. The existence of such a process is an exciting target for future investigation, as it may underpin a co-dependence of Mystran and Trojan.</p><p>Cuckoo was the only species with 4 family members, with the second Trojan gene likely being the result of a duplication event that occurred 44&#x02013;46 MYa. The calculated age is relatively distant, suggesting that the identified fourth family member is an actual gene and not a sequencing anomaly. A conversion was found between the two Trojan genes, making the proteins very similar in their extracellular regions. The functional advantage of an extra Trojan is also a target of future studies, as we will look for a similar gene organization in other avian species.</p><p>Evolutionary pressure to adapt has probably played a major role in the diversification of Mystran, Trojan and Thracian genes, as seen in the tree. Indeed, we found evidence of positive evolutionary selection for all the family members. For Mystran, the extensive positive selection within its extracellular region has probably been a response to changes in its ligand or interacting molecules. The positively selected residues found outside the domains likely provided an overall protein adaptation and indirect flexibility for the structured regions. However, the &#x0201c;spikes&#x0201d; of positive selection within the domains imply, that certain structural or recognition adjustments were required. In contrast, the extremely conserved cytoplasmic tail of Mystran, hints that the downstream signaling mechanism had to remain unchanged. Therefore, Mystran is a protein for which intense extracellular adaptation of molecular interaction is coupled to intracellular preservation of function. This overall evolutionary pattern appears very similar to the selection described for another rPTP, the common leukocyte antigen CD45 [<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Fast evolving molecules tend to interact with other rapidly evolving molecules [<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], raising the question of what the partner of Mystran could be. As already proposed, we can expect Mystran to interact with a ligand or some other cell surface protein. If the phosphatase is immune-related, the extensive positive evolutionary selection may have been in response to pathogen challenges.</p><p>For Trojan, the relatively low number of positively selected amino acids was probably due to functional constraints or less adaptation challenges. The single cluster of selected residues falls within a region rich in ID binding sites, further pointing towards the importance of that area. The selection has probably lead to an adaptation of the binding properties of the region and the protein as a whole. ID regions have indeed been shown to be highly mutable and evolving, probably due to the lack of structural restraints [<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, the relative conservation of the domains may have been compensated by the intensive adaptation of this region. The lack of positive selection within the cytoplasmic tail, implies that its putative signaling mechanism did not require adjustments.</p><p>For Thracian, the three extracellular patches of positively selected sites probably provided adaptive flexibility for the adjacent domains. The conservation of the domains was likely due to functional constraints or simply no requirements for fine-tuning. The positively selected sites within the cytoplasmic tail indicate some adaptation of its intracellular signaling potential.</p><p>The possibility of a functional interaction between Mystran and Trojan was suggested by the identified intermolecular co-evolving amino acids. The pair of co-evolving amino acids between Mystran and Thracian hints towards a co-dependent function of them, as well. This could place the phosphatase in the middle of the intermolecular co-evolutionary events, where the family members may even function in concordance via Mystran. The actual existence of of such co-dependence and whether it involves a physical interaction between the proteins has yet to be determined experimentally. Amino acids from separate domains, co-evolving with the same residue of another protein, may be a sign of domain co-dependence [<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Therefore, we could expect a functional correlation between the domains of Trojan, as several of their residues are co-evolving with the same amino acid from Mystran.</p><p>In Mystran, the numerous connected constellations of co-evolving residues probably provided a coordinated overall adaptation of the extracellular region. The N-glycosylation sites among them indicate a global adjustment of the sugar frame, probably of structural advantage. The smaller networks are likely responsible for the localized adaptation of distinct regions of the protein. The two major cytoplasmic networks of Mystran were relatively small, likely due to conservation of the signaling mechanism.</p><p>Identifying co-evolving amino acids from a region of no assessed domains hints towards some functional significance of the region [<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Finding such residues from the ID binding sites of Mystran and Trojan, further supports the proposed functional importance if these regions.</p><p>The largest network in Trojan was formed mainly by residues around the CCP domain, likely due to functional constraints. Such a co-evolutionary pattern probably helps to maintain the conformational and functional stability of a domain [<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Residues from the two FN3 domains were found within the other networks, further hinting towards their co-dependent function. No networks were found for the cytoplasmic tail, probably due to conservation of its hypothesized signaling mechanism.</p><p>In Thracian the largest evolutionary network consisted of residues confined to the pair of FN3 domains, suggesting an active process of co-dependent adaptation. In the cytoplasm, finding amino acids of the ITAM as mutually co-evolving underlines the significance of this SFM.</p><p>The identified extracellular co-evolutionary networks within Mystran, Trojan and Thracian hint towards a yet another functional possibility. As has been described for TLRs [<xref rid="pone.0121672.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], intramolecular co-evolving amino acids can be linked to the ability of a molecule to form homodimers. Therefore, in addition to the suggested interaction between the family members, Mystran, Trojan and Thracian may also homodimerize. The existence and functional means of such interaction is an intriguing topic of further investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec010"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The previously described Trojan protein has been predicted to be part of a novel chicken gene/protein family. Here, we characterize the other Trojan-like family members from chicken and show that the family exists in other birds, as well as reptiles and fish. The phylogenetic analysis revealed a step-wise segregation between the homologues across avian species, a result of gene conversion events. We demonstrate that positive evolutionary selection has acted predominantly on the extracellular regions of the family members. In contrast, almost no positively selected sites were found within their intracellular regions. Therefore, the opposing evolutionary selections combined an environment-driven extracellular adaptation with preservation of the cytoplasmic signaling mechanism. The predicted topology of the proteins hints towards extracellular ligand/partner interactions, that are yet to be identified. Our co-evolutionary analyzes suggested a functional co-dependence between the family members, that may involve their physical association.
