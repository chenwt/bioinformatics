The shRNA-mediated screening of the functions of the genes for retinal development in retinal explant culture suggested a role for <italic>Kcnj10</italic> in the differentiation of 23M&#x000fc;ller glia. In the present study, we extended the work and focused on analyzing the role of <italic>Kcnj10</italic> in retinal development.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>shRNA-mediated downregulation of <italic>Kcnj10</italic> in retinal explants and the in vivo mouse retina at the P1 stage was performed. Differentiation and proliferation of the retina were examined with immunohistochemistry. The effect of barium (Ba<sup>2+</sup>) treatment, which inhibits potassium currents by blocking potassium channels, on retinal development was examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>When Kcnj10 was downregulated at E18, cellular proliferation and morphological differentiation were perturbed; in particular, a decreased number of M&#x000fc;ller glial cells with abnormal morphological maturation was observed. The overexpression of <italic>Kcnj10</italic> in retinal progenitors did not result in gross abnormality during retinal development, but rescued the abnormal differentiation induced with sh-Kcnj10. The presence of Ba<sup>2+</sup> in the retinal explant medium led to a phenotype similar to that seen with sh-Kcnj10. Ba<sup>2+</sup> exerts an effect mainly during late retinal development, and sh-Kcnj10 in the P1 retina affected M&#x000fc;ller glia maturation, suggesting that <italic>Kcnj10</italic> plays a pivotal role in the maturation of retinal cell subsets. A previous study of <italic>Kcnj10</italic>-knockout mice showed no obvious abnormality in retinal differentiation, especially of M&#x000fc;ller glia. We examined the effects of the downregulation of <italic>Kcnj10</italic> with in vivo electroporation of sh-Kcnj10 in the P1 retina. Retinal differentiation was perturbed, as seen following the in vitro downregulation of <italic>Kcnj10</italic>, suggesting that compensatory gene expression and/or signaling occurred in the <italic>Kcnj10</italic>-knockout mice in the retina, leading to normal eye development.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>Kcnj10</italic> plays a role in M&#x000fc;ller glia maturation during retinal development probably through ionic channel activities.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>GalleyStatus</meta-name><meta-value>Export to XML</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The neural retina comprises various neurons and glial cells that are generated in a specific temporal order from a common pool of retinal progenitor cells [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. There is diversity within each type of neuron [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], giving rise to complex neuronal networks and information processing [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Various molecules, such as transcription factors and neurotrophic factors, have been reported to play important roles in retinal cell differentiation [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>We are interested in the transition of retinal progenitors during retinal development, and cell surface antigens gave us an opportunity to purify retinal cells at different retinal developmental stages. We found that SSEA-1 labels early embryonic retinal progenitor cells [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and the c-kit labels retinal progenitor cells at around birth [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. We then examined the gene expression signature during retinal development, focused on genes specifically expressed in the retinal progenitor at P1, and found that a number of genes specifically expressed in this retinal fraction were related to M&#x000fc;ller glia development [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. <italic>Kcnj10</italic> (Kir4.1) is one of these genes, and we found that downregulation of <italic>Kcnj10</italic> with shRNA in retinal explant resulted in the failure of proper differentiation of the retina, and expression of <italic>Kcnj10</italic> was suppressed by the presence of Notch signaling inhibitor DAPT in the culture [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Kcnj10 is an inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunit and well-known since it plays essential roles in the function of the inner ear [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and causes SeSAME/EAST (OMIM <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://omim.org/entry/612780">612780</ext-link>) syndrome, which is characterized by sensorineural deafness and many neurologic symptoms [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Many genes have been identified as members of the <italic>Kcnj</italic> family, and the genes were classified into seven subfamilies (<italic>Kir1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>Kir7</italic>) [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. They participate in renal epithelial cells [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and are related to various diseases of the central nervous system [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. <italic>Kcnj10</italic> was initially isolated in the brain by several groups [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and is predominantly expressed in brain glial cells [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In the retina, <italic>Kcnj10</italic> is expressed in M&#x000fc;ller glia of the rat and rabbit eye [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, previous work showed that retinal cells including M&#x000fc;ller glia were morphologically normal in the eye of <italic>Kcnj10</italic>-knockout mice [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In situ whole-cell patch-clamp recordings showed a tenfold increase in the input resistance and large depolarization of <italic>Kir4.1</italic>-knockout M&#x000fc;ller cells [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The normal morphological development of the retina of <italic>Kcnj10</italic>-knockout mice was different from our data that sh-RNA-mediated downregulation of <italic>Kcnj10</italic> in retinal progenitor cells resulted in perturbation of morphological differentiation of the retina [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In this work, we extended of analysis of the function of <italic>Kcnj10</italic> during retinal development using retinal explant culture in more detail. We found that <italic>Kcnj10</italic> plays pivotal roles in the proliferation of retinal progenitors and maturation of subsets of retinal cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals, reagent, and plasmids</title><p>All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo and conducted in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the U.S. National Institutes of Health regarding the care and use of animals for experimental procedures and the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. ICR mice were obtained from Japan SLC Co (Shizuoka, Japan), and we confirmed that the mice were free of the <italic>Rd1</italic> mutation. The day a vaginal plug was observed was embryonic day 0 (E0), and the day of birth was termed postnatal day 0 (P0). Barium chloride dihydrate (Wako, Osaka, Japan) was dissolved in Hank&#x02019;s Balance Salt Solution (HBSS) at 100&#x000a0;mM. An expression plasmid of sh-Kcnj10 (pU6-shRNA expression vector: mouse U6 promoter in pBluescript-KS [<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]) was described in a previous work [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Target sequences of sh-Kcnj10 are the first 5&#x02032;-AAG GAA GTA TTC AGA CTT TAA CA-3&#x02032; and second 5&#x02032;-AAG AGC CAG CTT ATG TGC TTT CA-3&#x02032; (Appendix 1). As a control, an empty pU6 vector was used. The efficiency of sh-Kcnj10 was examined using the mouse retina. The isolated retina at E18 was electroporated with 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of sh-Kcnj10 or control vector, and after 48 h, the retinas were harvested. <italic>Kcnj10</italic> levels were examined with RT&#x02013;PCR using the whole retina. The results were obtained by using the first sh-Kcnj10, and essentially the same main data were obtained with the second sh-Kcnj10. As an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing vector, pCAG-EGFP, which is effective for expressing exogenous genes in most retinal subtypes, was used. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) for the <italic>Kcnj</italic> family members was performed using a Roche LightCycler 1.5 apparatus (Roshe, Basel, Switzerland) and was analyzed with the second derivative maximum method for quantification (Roche Diagnostics). The sequence of primers are as follows: <italic>Kcnj10</italic> forward 5&#x02032;-AGT CTT GGC CCT GCC T-3&#x02032;, reverse 5&#x02032;-AGC GAC CGA CGT CAT C-3&#x02032;, <italic>Kcnj13</italic> forward 5&#x02032;-TGG ACT TCC ACC TTG A-3&#x02032;, reverse 5&#x02032;-TGG AGC AGG GTA GCT A-3&#x02032;, <italic>Kcnj15</italic> forward 5&#x02032;-TTG CTG CCA CCT TTG T-3&#x02032;, 5&#x02032;-TAA TGC AGG GTG TGT G-3&#x02032;. &#x003b2;-actin was used as the control. Full-length mouse <italic>Kcnj10</italic> (Appendix 1), which covers from the first ATG to termination codon, was cloned with RT&#x02013;PCR, and the sequence of an isolated <italic>Kcnj10</italic> clone was confirmed with a DNA sequence. The primers used for cloning were forward 5&#x02032;-ATG ACG TCG GTC GCT AAG GT -3&#x02032; and reverse 5&#x02032;-TCA GAC GTT GCT GAT GCG CA-3&#x02032;. Full-length <italic>Kcnj10</italic> was subcloned into downstream of the CAG promoter. Total RNA was purified from the retinas using RNeasy Plus Micro (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands), and cDNA was synthesized using SuperScriptII (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA).</p></sec><sec><title>RNA-sequencing and microarray</title><p>RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data were obtained as follows. Total RNA was extracted from the retinas of wild-type C57/BL/6J mice at P7 or P14 using the RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (Qiagen), and the RNA quality was confirmed using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). The DNA microarray was performed using cDNA prepared from the retinal explant from E15 (culture days 0, 5, and 14) using the Affymetrix mouse genome 430 2.0 array (2004).</p></sec><sec><title>Retinal explant culture, BrdU incorporation assay, and in vivo electroporation into the retina</title><p>Retinal explant cultures were prepared as described previously [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. For the cell proliferation assay, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; Sigma-Aldrich, MO; 1.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml at final concentration) was added to the explant media, and the retinas were then fixed after 24 h of culture. BrdU was visualized with immunostaining as described previously [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For transfection, the U6-Kcnj10 or U6-empty vector was transfected with pCAG-EGFP, which was used as a marker of transfected samples. In vitro plasmid transfection to the isolated mouse retina was performed using electroporation with an Electroporator CUY21 (Nepa Gene, Chiba, Japan) and electrode CYU520P5 (Nepa Gene). Briefly, retinas were transferred to a microelectroporation chamber filled with plasmid solution (25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of pCAG-EGFP and 75&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of sh-Kcnj10 or U6-vector, plasmids were dissolved 1&#x000a0;mg/ml in HBSS), and four square pulses (25 V) of 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;s duration with 950&#x000a0;&#x003bc;s intervals were applied using the CUY21 pulse generator. In vivo electroporation was performed as previously described [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] with slight modifications. Approximately 0.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l DNA solution (mixture of pCAG-EGFP and sh-Kcnj10 or U6-vector, 1:3) was injected into the subretinal space of the P1 mouse retina. Square electric pulses (100&#x000a0;V, six 50-ms pulses at 950-ms intervals) by using a pulse generator, CUY21 SC (Nepa Gene, Japan) were delivered with the CUY650-P5 Platinum Plate Tweezers Electrode (Nepa Gene, Chiba, Japan). The electroporated retinas were harvested at P12.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Immunostaining of frozen sections was done as described previously [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Briefly, retinal explants were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min on ice, treated with 25% sucrose for 30 min, embedded in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Miles), and sectioned (10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m thickness) using the cryostat (CM3050S, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The primary antibodies used were mouse monoclonal antibodies anti-glutamine synthetase (Chemicon), PNR (ppmx), HuC/D (Molecular Probes), Ki67 (BD Bioscience), BrdU (Roche Diagnostics), rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-Calbindin 28k (Chemicon), PNR, Ccnd3 active Caspase-3 (Promega), GFP (BD Biosciences), sheep polyclonal antibody anti-Chx10 (Exalpha Biologicals), and rat polyclonal antibody anti-GFP (Nakarai). Primary antibody signals were visualized using appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa 488 or Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Examination of expression of members of the <italic>Kcnj</italic> family in the mouse retina with RNA sequence</title><p>Previously, we found that <italic>Kcnj10</italic> was expressed in c-kit-positive retinal progenitor cells, and RT-qPCR analysis indicated that the expression level of <italic>Kcnj10</italic> increased in the later stages of retinal development [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We first examined the retinal expression of <italic>Kcnj</italic> family genes with RNA-seq data from whole mouse retinas at P7 and P14. At P7, the expression level of <italic>Kcnj10</italic> was the highest among all <italic>Kcnj</italic> family members considered (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). At P14, the highest expression level was observed for <italic>Kcnj14</italic>, although its expression level at P7 was relatively low (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The downregulation of <italic>Kcnj14</italic> in the photoreceptor-specific nuclear receptor (PNR)-knockout retina was reported previously [<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], suggesting <italic>Kcnj14</italic> is expressed in photoreceptors. <italic>Kcnj9</italic> also showed a high level of expression at P14. Members of the <italic>Kcnj</italic> family are classified into four sub-families according to their structure; of these, <italic>Kcnj10</italic> belongs to the potassium inwardly-rectifying channel family [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. <italic>Kcnj1</italic>, -<italic>13</italic>, -<italic>15</italic>, and -<italic>16</italic> belong to the same family, but these members showed negligible retinal expression at P7 and P14 based on our RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>Kcnj10</italic> is one of the main potassium transport channels of the <italic>Kcnj</italic> family in the retina. Since we used retinal explant culture in the following experiments, we also examined the expression profiles of members of the <italic>Kcnj</italic> family in retinal explants using the gene expression profile of retinal explant cultures. DNA microarray data of retinal explant culture prepared from the mouse retina at E15 (0-day, 5-day, and 14-day cultured retina) was examined (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The <italic>Kcnj10</italic> level increased during explant culture as in vivo, and relatively high expression levels of <italic>Kcnj3</italic>, <italic>-9</italic>, and -<italic>10</italic> were observed in the RNA-seq and microarray data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="t1" position="float"><?Table Large?><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Expression of

Thus, here we examined the detailed development of retinas in which <italic>Kcnj10</italic> was downregulated with sh-RNA. We transfected an expression plasmid carrying sh-RNA against <italic>Kcnj10</italic> (sh-Kcnj10) into isolated retinas at E18, and the retinas were cultured as explants. We first examined the efficiency of the suppression of the expression level of <italic>Kcnj10</italic> by the expression of sh-Kcnj10 in the retina. The efficiency of electroporation using the mouse retina at around birth is more than 50% (Appendix 1). sh-Kcnj10 was electroporated into the retina at E18, and after 48 h of the culture, the retinas were harvested and subjected to RT-qPCR. The level of <italic>Kcnj10</italic> in sh-Kcnj10 was less than 50% of that in the control (Appendix 1). At the same time, we examined the expression level of <italic>Kcnj13</italic> and -<italic>15</italic>, which are closely related to <italic>Kcnj10</italic> in their structure [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The expression level of <italic>Kcnj13</italic> was not changed by the expression of sh-Kcnj10, and that of <italic>Kcnj15</italic> was not detectable in the control and sh-Kcnj10-expressing retina (Appendix 1). We first examined the sub-retinal localization of sh-Kcnj10-expressing cells in the retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). On day 3 of culture, strong EGFP signals were observed the inside the neuroblastic layer; most cells on the outer half of the layer showed weak EGFP signals in the control and sh-Kcnj10 plasmid-transfected groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). On day 7 of culture, the intensity of the EGFP signal in the cells on the outer side of the neuroblastic layer became stronger than on day 3, and the distribution of EGFP expression between the control and sh-Kcnj10-transfected retinas was similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). On day 14, cells showing strong EGFP positivity were observed in the outer nuclear layer (ONL), but not in the inner nuclear layer (INL) in the control group; in contrast, in the sh-Kcnj10-expressing retina, strong EGFP positivity was observed mostly in the INL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). These cells were large compared to the small cells in the ONL, which showed weak EGFP signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Therefore, these results suggest that the increased percentage of amacrine cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1E</xref> may be caused by the decreased rod photoreceptors rather than the increased number of amacrine cells. We found ectopically localized HuC/D or Pax6-positive cells in the ONL in sh-Kcnj10-expressing samples, but these cells were EGFP negative.

Almost all known Kir channel subunits are highly sensitive to extracellular Ba<sup>2+</sup> [<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and Ba<sup>2+</sup> is often used to test the physiologic roles of potassium channels in various tissues, including retinal glial cells [<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We started retinal explant cultures using retinas at E18 with (0.5 and 10&#x000a0;mM, final concentration) or without Ba<sup>2+</sup> in the culture medium. After 7 days of culture, we examined the gross morphology and differentiation of the retinal cells with immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). DAPI staining showed no significant difference between the control and Ba<sup>2+</sup>-treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>).

On day 14, the morphology of the 1.0&#x000a0;mM Ba<sup>2+</sup>-treated samples was severely perturbed; a rosette-like structure formed in the ONL, while the INL looked relatively normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). In addition, the 0.5&#x000a0;mM Ba<sup>2+</sup>-treated samples were much thinner than the control samples on day 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>).

Sh-Kcnj10 was electroporated into isolated retinas at P1, and the retinas were cultured as explants for 12 days.

Our experiments with Ba<sup>2+</sup> suggest that the functional effects of Kcnj10 on the retina are mediated through channel activity. Our initial query in this study involved the question of why sh-Kcnj10 affected retinal explants even though M&#x000fc;ller glia from <italic>Kcnj10</italic>-knockout mice were reported to be morphologically normal [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We first surmised that differences between the retinas in vitro and in vivo (e.g., ionic strength) resulted in the difference in phenotype caused by the downregulation of <italic>Kcnj10</italic>. However, the in vivo downregulation of <italic>Kcnj10</italic> at stage P1 via the expression of sh-Kcnj10 resulted in the failure of appropriate differentiation, suggesting that this explanation was insufficient to elucidate the difference. In terms of structure, <italic>Kcnj13</italic> and <italic>Kcnj15</italic> are closely related to Kcnj10 [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, other members of the <italic>Kcnj</italic> family, which have redundant functions with <italic>Kcnj10</italic>, might be expressed in a compensatory manner in <italic>Kcnj10</italic>-knockout cells. This situation was observed in the case of retinoblastoma protein (Rb). When Rb was genetically knocked out in mice, p107 was upregulated, and functional compensation by p107 or p130 was reported [<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Although we did not observe induction of expression of <italic>Kcnj13</italic> and <italic>Kcnj15</italic> by sh-Kcnj10 in explants, similar examination in the <italic>Kcnj10</italic>-knockout retina may provide conclusive evidence.</p><p>We found that the downregulation of <italic>Kcnj10</italic> and treatment with Ba<sup>2+</sup> resulted in different phenotypes (sh-Kcnj10 suppressed retinal progenitor cell proliferation whereas Ba<sup>2+</sup> did not). Sh-Kcnj10 expression also perturbed the differentiation of bipolar cells and rods, which are late-differentiating cell types; therefore, we surmise that the phenotype was secondary to the effects of suppression on proliferation rather than fate change of retinal progenitors. <italic>Kcnj16</italic> modulates Kcnj10 channel conductance [<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and heteromeric Kcnj10/16 channels were reported to be expressed in M&#x000fc;ller glia [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Perturbation of the stoichiometry of Kcnj10 with interacting molecules by sh-Kcnj10 may be one cause of the phenotypic differences that resulted from sh-Kcnj10 and Ba<sup>2+</sup> treatment. Interestingly, perisynaptic processes and the end feet of M&#x000fc;ller cells harbor homomeric or heteromeric Kcnj channels in opposite directions to the cell membrane [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, a lack of <italic>Kcnj10</italic> in M&#x000fc;ller glia may result in complex phenotypes compared with simple blockage of the channel from the outside. However, <italic>Kcnj10</italic> overexpression had no effect on retinal development. The modification of <italic>Kcnj10</italic> by pH is well-known. PtdIns(4,5)P2 also modifies <italic>Kcnj10</italic> function, and binding proteins such as Mag1 regulate the localization of <italic>Kcnj10</italic> [<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We suspect that these modifiers did not function appropriately for exogenous <italic>Kcnj10</italic>, or that retinal <italic>Kcnj10</italic> expression may have been saturated when we overexpressed <italic>Kcnj10</italic>.</p><p>A previous study indicated the negative involvement of Kcnj10 in proliferation during wound healing in human corneal epithelial cells through calcium signaling [<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Ba<sup>2+</sup> treatment also promoted the proliferation of neural precursor cells [<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Therefore, our observations may not be explained by simple blockage of the inward potassium current. In the case of Kv potassium channels, the involvement of Kv channels in epithelial cell proliferation has been reported, and Kv4.1 is related to gastric cancer cell proliferation [<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Kv and Kir channels are clearly different channels, but calcium mobilization occurs downstream of both channels. The positive involvement of calcium signaling in cellular proliferation under certain situations by Kv4.1 and Kcnj10 is one possible mechanism.</p><p>Changes in the Kcnj10 level in M&#x000fc;ller glial cells of RGS rats during retinal degeneration has been reported [<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In addition to changing the membrane potential of M&#x000fc;ller glia during degeneration, changes in membrane potential have also been demonstrated during M&#x000fc;ller glia development [<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. At an early stage of M&#x000fc;ller glia differentiation, no inward potassium current was observed; however, the inward current increased during maturation of the cells. These results suggest important roles for potassium channels in M&#x000fc;ller glia development. Taken together, in this study we uncovered a role for <italic>Kcnj10</italic> in retinal development using an explant culture system and an in vivo electroporation system. Further molecular analysis using these systems may shed new light on the role and molecular mechanisms of <italic>Kcnj10</italic> in retinal development.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by a grant-in-aid from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science (15118708).</p></ack><app-group><app><title>Appendix 1.
