The reproductive biology of hermaphrodites has long been intriguing; however, very little is known about the molecular pathways underlying their sex change. Here, we provide the first <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome analyses of a hermaphrodite teleost&#x000b4;s undergoing sex change in its natural environment. Our study has examined relative gene expression across multiple groups&#x02014;rather than just two contrasting conditions&#x02014; and has allowed us to explore the differential expression patterns throughout the whole process. Our analysis has highlighted the rapid and complex genomic response of the brain associated with sex change, which is subsequently transmitted to the gonads, identifying a large number of candidate genes, some well-known and some novel, involved in the process. The present study provides strong evidence of the importance of the sex steroidogenic machinery during sex change in clownfish, with the aromatase gene playing a central role, both in the brain and the gonad. This work constitutes the first genome-wide study in a social sex-changing species and provides insights into the genetic mechanism governing social sex change and gonadal restructuring in protandrous hermaphrodites.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Teleost fishes display the largest array of sex-determining systems among animals, resulting in a large number of reproductive strategies, a key factor in explaining their success during evolution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Among these, functional hermaphroditism is a unique strategy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> that has been adopted by at least 27 families across seven orders of teleosts, mainly in the coral reef environment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. In <italic>simultaneous</italic> hermaphroditism individuals possess fully functional male and female gonads while in <italic>sequential</italic> hermaphroditism fish change sex sometime during its life, either from male to female (protandry) or from female to male (protogyny). Factors triggering sex change differ among species. In some, particularly in protandrous species, sex change is size dependent and eventually every fish in the population will change sex. In territorial-haremic species sex change is socially mediated, and it is more common in protogynous species. One interesting exception are the clownfishes (subfamily Amphiprioninae) which are protandrous, monogamous and sex change seems to be controlled socially<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, i.e. male does not change sex when attaining a certain size, but only after the female disappearance. It has been suggested that sequential hermaphroditism in reef habitats improves adaptation, increases survival rates and enhances reproduction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. However, our understanding of the molecular pathways underlying reproductive processes, particularly sex change in hermaphrodites, is very limited.</p><p>Clownfishes (subfamily Amphiprioninae) are extensively distributed in tropical waters, where they inhabit shallow waters across the Red Sea, the Indian and the western Pacific Oceans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. They live in an obligate symbiosis with certain sea anemones that provide the fish with nesting sites and protection from predators<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. The sessile nature of anemones makes clownfishes a good system for investigating socially-controlled sex change since the process can be monitored in experiments conducted in the field.</p><p>Clownfishes live in social assemblages as pairs or social groups consisting of a dominant female, always the largest in size, surrounded by a male and a variable number of immature juveniles of smaller size<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Clownfish species display a strong social hierarchy based on size<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. These hierarchies function as queues for breeding. In a given group, the fish age and grow larger together, with their relative size differences and the dominance hierarchies among group members remaining unchanged<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Although a simplification, we hereafter call these social assemblages families. If the dominant female of a family dies, all subordinates seize the opportunity to ascend in rank and grow. The male is poised to become female and rapidly changes sex to assume the vacated position, while the largest undifferentiated fish completes the breeding pair by turning into a mature male in a short time<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. This ability allows the formation of a new breeding pair, preventing the need for dangerous travel across the reef, but requires the presence of subdominant fish to complete the sex change<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p><p>Shortly after the female is removed, the behavioral repertoire switches. The male who used to receive orders from the female now displays aggression and dominance, beginning to court the smaller fish as the female would. The brain mediates these behavioral changes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, although very little is known about the neural and transcriptional mechanisms that orchestrate sex change in fishes. These changes in the relative neuronal activity in the male fish&#x02019;s brain are transmitted along the hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary-gonadal axis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Receptors on the gonadal tissue receive the hormonal signals and resorb or extend accordingly, completing the gonadal sex change<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. This process involves a complete reorganization of the gonadal tissue. The gonad of the functional males is an ovotestis, with the presence of both testicular and ovarian tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. However, while the testes are mature, the ovary is in an immature phase (with only oogonia and primary growth oocytes). At the time male begins to change sex it enters the transition phase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, which is characterized by the progressive degeneration of the testes concomitant with the proliferation of the ovarian tissue. At the end of the transitional phase the testicular tissue is resorbed and shortly after females become mature. The importance of gonadal sex steroid hormones, especially estrogens, as key regulators of sex change in clownfish has been proposed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. However, the upstream mechanisms controlling the production and activity of gonadal steroid hormones during sex change in clownfish remain largely unknown<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>.</p><p>Here, we aim to provide insights into the genetic mechanism governing social sex change in fish, using the Red Sea endemic species of clownfish, <italic>Amphiprion bicinctus</italic>, as a model in its natural habitat. We seek to shed light on the main gene regulatory networks involved in the whole sex change process by observing the cascade of expression changes, their specific patterns and their temporal autocorrelations via a transcriptomic approach. Our time-series expression experiment provides information regarding the complete set of genes that is activated, as well as the dynamics and interactions between these genes. Our analysis is focused on the two main organs involved in sexual development and reproduction, the brain and gonads<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Histological analysis of gonads indicates a gradual decrease of testicular tissue during the male-to-female sex change</title><p>Gonads were histologically analyzed in twelve sex-changing individuals, two functional males and six functional females that were used as controls for the completion of sex change (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The gonads of functional males had 55% female tissue, on average similar in value to the gonads of changing males collected on days 5 and 11. As sex change progressed, the gonads of changing males had a steadily decreasing amount of testicular tissue and increasing amounts of ovarian tissue, reaching 87% 40 days after the removal of the original females. During the last steps of the transition (days 40&#x02013;50 after removal of the original females), individuals possessed highly degenerated and reduced testes, but their oocytes, although increased in size, remained in the primary-growth stage; i.e., none showed evidence of ripening (onset of vitellogenesis). All functional females were mature with vitellogenic oocytes in spawning-capable phase. Interestingly, one fish, CF10M, who belonged to a three-member family when it was originally tagged but was left alone in the anemone when the female was removed since the third member had disappeared, did not undergo the expected male-to-female sex change. The histological exam of CF10M&#x02019;S gonads at the time of collection, 35 days after the original female was removed, did not show any signs of sex change and was therefore grouped in the male category.</p><p>For the correlation analysis, the index of sex change of each individual as measured by the percentage of female tissue in the gonad was used. For the pairwise differential expression analysis, individuals were grouped into five categories according to the percentage of female tissue in the gonad (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>): &#x0201c;male&#x0201d; (M), &#x0201c;transitional male&#x0201d; (TM), &#x0201c;transitional female&#x0201d; (TF), &#x0201c;immature female&#x0201d; (FI) and &#x0201c;mature female&#x0201d; (FM). Since the proportion of female tissue in functional males was 55% and 100% in functional females (45% difference), a group was defined every 15% increase in female tissue resulting in three transitional groups. One of these groups (TF) has only two individuals, while it should ideally have three or more, which may impair the power for detecting differences in expression. However, this risk of impairment is reduced due to the statistical approach taken and the fact that the selection criteria of the genes is based not solely on pairwise, but also on correlation analysis.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Read pre-processing, de novo transcriptome assembly and abundance estimation</title><p>The sequencing process produced a total of 278&#x02009;million paired-end reads (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref> for more detailed information). The selected assembly produced an estimated number of 516,599 Trinity transcripts, with a median contig length of 603&#x02009;bp, mean of 1,025&#x02009;bp and 43.58% GC content. Evaluation of the genome for completeness identified 95.6% complete and 100% partial genes from the 248 core eukaryotic genes dataset (CEGs). Analysis of the reconstructed transcripts using TransDecoder revealed a total of 96,589 contigs potentially containing candidate protein-coding regions. CD-HIT-EST was then used to merge similar contigs (identity threshold of 0.9) resulting in 47,065 contigs with an N50 of 1,563&#x02009;bp.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Differential Expression Analysis of brain tissue reveals a marked down-regulation during transitional stages and very little differences between mature males and females</title><p>Comparisons were conducted separately for the brain and gonadal samples, since the hierarchical clustering performed with the sample-to-sample distances revealed two well-differentiated groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1A</xref>). Clustering analysis of each of the tissues separately shows that expression profiles from the brain samples display higher similarity than those from the gonad samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1B,C</xref>).</p><p>To unveil the time course of the brain transcriptome throughout the sex change, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficients between normalized expression levels in brain samples (DESeq_normalized) and the index of sex change of each individual. A total of 1,531 contigs showed significant correlation (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) to the index of sex change, with 884 contigs positively correlated and 647 contigs negatively correlated. Only 12 contigs showed high significance (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), eight with positive and four with negative correlation (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Therefore, more contigs were found to be female-biased than male-biased in the brain. The scatterplot of the correlations against the dispersion in expression shows that the distribution of correlation coefficients was similar on both sides of the spectrum, female and male, with largest values of 0.8, indicating that there was as much up-regulation at the beginning as at the end of the sex-change process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Significantly correlated contigs displayed small dispersion, especially the contigs up-regulated at the end of the sex-change process, i.e., when the correlation was positive. The largest differences in expression were observed in contigs not correlated to the index of sex change (grey dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>), indicating that most of the differences in the brain samples were observed during transitional stages.</p><p>The analysis of differential expression among the five sex categories based on histology results revealed a significance (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) in 163 contigs of which only two also showed correlation with the index of sex change (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). The vast majority of the differentially expressed contigs (DECs) were found in comparisons involving transitional stages (TM and TF), while very few contigs were differentially expressed between males (M) and female stages (FI, FM) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). In the brain, the main changes in expression occurred therefore during transitional stages, an observation that also explains the paucity of correlated contigs found in the previous analysis.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Differential Expression Analysis of gonad tissue reveals a later response than in brain and large differences in expression between mature males and females</title><p>The Pearson correlation coefficients between normalized expression levels in gonad (DESeq_normalized) and the index of sex change of each individual revealed a total of 5,483 contigs showing significant correlation (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), with 2,602 contigs positively correlated and 2,881 contigs negatively correlated. We found 558 contigs with highly significant correlations (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001); 206 of these were positively correlated, while the remaining 352 were negatively correlated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Thus, more contigs were found to be male-biased, the opposite trend than in the brain samples. The scatterplot of the correlations against the dispersion in expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>) shows that significantly correlated contigs displayed a wide range of differential expression. Significant positive correlations were generally smaller; the largest value was 0.8. Eighty-three negatively correlated contigs had coefficients above 0.8. Also the contigs that were up-regulated in females showed a larger range in differential expression. Strong correlation indicates a steady increase or decrease in expression, but often with small differences among individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). On the contrary there were contigs with large differences in expression, some of them not correlated with the index of sex change at the individual level (grey dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>), but displaying large differences in expression in some of the sex change categories. The plot of the dispersion for the gonads was similar to that for the brain although generally there were larger differences among individuals.</p><p>The multiple pairwise comparisons among the five sex categories at the gonadal level revealed a total of 434 contigs showing significant differential expression (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), with 224 of them also showing correlation to the index of sex change (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). The majority (160) were negatively correlated while 64 were positively correlated. The majority of the significant DECs were found in comparisons involving mature females (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>), indicating that expression patterns during the last phase of the sex change are clearly distinct from all the previous stages. The largest number of DECs was found between male categories (M and TM) compared to mature females, and the smallest numbers between consecutive stages as expected (M-TM, TM-TF and TF-FI) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>PCA and cluster analyses of differential expression unravels the changes originating in the brain and subsequently transmitted to the gonads</title><p>For further analyses, we selected all contigs showing significant correlation and differential expression at p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001, a total of 173 contigs from the brain and 768 contigs from the gonadal transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). The PCA and cluster analysis performed on the selected contigs from the brain revealed a clear clustering of individuals into two well-defined groups: (i) transitional fish (transitional males and transitional females) and (ii) non-transitional fish, (males, mature females and immature females) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). The difference between transitional males and transitional females is considerably larger than differences between any groups in the non-transitional cluster. Although males and mature females form two distinct groups, they cluster together with immature females and are clearly separated from transitional males and females. Hierarchical clustering of the transcripts resulted in three main clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>, vertical dendrogram). Two of the clusters grouped transcripts that were either expressed in all the reproductive stages tested (BG3) or were slightly down-regulated in transitional fish (BG2). The third cluster (BG1) comprised transcripts that were clearly down-regulated in the transitional stages (TM, TF). The expression of selected genes for each group is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>. Expression patterns include up-regulation in males (<italic>popdc3, rab41, nt5</italic>), marked down-regulation in transitional stages (<italic>hdgfrp2</italic>, <italic>tenm2, foxp4, sox6),</italic> up-regulation in transitional stages (<italic>tspan8</italic>) and up-regulation in females (<italic>adamts16, cyp19a1b, f13a, phactr4)</italic>.</p><p>Clustering of the selected contigs from the gonads resulted in a completely different arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). The PCA and cluster analysis resulted in three major clusters. Males and transitional males clustered together forming a separate group from the female stages. Within the female stages, two other distinct groups can be observed: mature females formed a separate cluster from transitional and immature ones. Hierarchical clustering of transcripts revealed five clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>, vertical dendrogram), from those up-regulated at the onset of sex change (M and TM, GG 1), to those up-regulated only in females (FM, GG5). In between, a group of transcripts that, while still up-regulated in all male categories, were also expressed in transitional females (TF, FI, GG2) and in females (GG3). Another group of transcripts were found not to be expressed in males, but showed signs of up-regulation in transitional fish and females (GG4). These clear expression patterns allow the identification of genes that likely play key roles during each stage of sex change. Expression profiles of a typical gene from each group are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>, including those up-regulated in males (<italic>tctex1</italic>, <italic>dnajb13</italic>, <italic>dpysl5</italic>, <italic>dmrt1</italic>, <italic>hsf5</italic>) and those up-regulated in females (<italic>foxl2</italic>, <italic>hsd17b1</italic>, <italic>star</italic>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Functional Annotation and Enrichment Analysis confirms the importance of hormone levels and steroid metabolic processes during sex change in clownfish</title><p>Out of the 47,065 contigs, 81.5% had positive BLASTx similarity hits with publicly available protein sequences.

Analysis of differentially expressed contigs that were specifically up-regulated in transitional stages resulted in nine over-represented GO terms that had significant GO enrichment for regulation of the G-protein-coupled receptor protein signaling pathway and activation of meiosis involved in egg development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>).</p><p>At the gonadal level, our hierarchical clustering revealed three well-supported groups, with male stages forming a clearly separated cluster from the two female groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>).

However, little previous work has examined differences in gene expression across a dynamic life history process. This study addresses the transcriptome analysis of sex change in a species with a strong social hierarchy. Our study is the first to highlight the rapid and complex genomic responses of the brain and gonad associated with sex change in the natural environment. Furthermore, our work examines relative gene expression across multiple groups&#x02014;rather than just two contrasting conditions&#x02014;allowing us to explore the differences in expression patterns, including those of intermediate stages, during the whole process.</p><sec disp-level="2"><title>The genetic mechanism underlying sex change in A. bicinctus: the central role for the aromatase gene</title><p>Our results show a transcriptional response in the male&#x02019;s brain two weeks after the female&#x02019;s disappearance. This response is subsequently transmitted to the gonads where differential expression and histological changes are clearly observed after three to four weeks. The main transcriptional response driving sex change at the brain level was found to be completed 30 days after removal of the original female, while differential expression is still detected in the gonads 50 days after removal of the original female, although sex change is completed when males become immature females. We hypothesize that changes in brain expression are transmitted to the gonad through the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Receptors on the gonadal tissue receive the hormonal signals resorbing the testicular tissue and developing the ovary to complete the gonadal sex change. Our study has revealed an important number of genes involved in these processes, some of well-known and several novel genes potentially playing a role in sex change, both at the brain and gonadal levels (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>, expression profiles are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S8</xref>).</p><sec disp-level="3"><title>Changes at the brain level: aromatization plays an essential role during sex change</title><p>Our analysis shows that functional males (day 0) and males whose female partners were removed 5 and 11 days earlier display very similar expression profiles, while no histological signal of sex change was observed at the gonadal level. Reorganization of gonadal tissue is costly, not only energetically but in terms of the time spent on sex change, a period during which the fish are not able to reproduce. In the case of <italic>A. bicinctus</italic>, this reorganization is moreover irreversible due to the full degeneration of the testicular tissue. It has been shown in other <italic>Amphiprion</italic> species that staying male and re-pairing with a new larger mate who has emigrated from another anemone is a more affordable mate acquisition strategy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Thus, the disappearance of the female would not trigger the sex change process at the brain level until it becomes clear to the male that moving up in the hierarchy is beneficial given the lasting absence of the female. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found the first clear changes in brain expression profiles of transitional males (days 15 to 30 after original female removal) compared to males (0&#x02013;11 days). These individuals showed a marked down-regulation in differentially expressed genes that was maintained also in transitional females. On the other hand, females displayed very similar expression patterns to males, indicating subtle sex differences in overall gene expression between both mature stages. Accordingly, most differentially expressed genes were detected in transitional stages and only twelve showed a significant correlation to the index of sex change.</p><p>To tease out the molecular basis of sex change in clownfish at the brain level, we examined differences in neural expression of both candidate and highly differentially expressed novel genes and assessed their gene expression patterns during the whole sex change process. A very well-known gene that plays an important role in sex change in teleosts both at the gonad and brain level is <italic>cyp19a1</italic> (also known as aromatase or <italic>P450aromA</italic>). In non-mammalian vertebrates, <italic>cyp19a1</italic> is a key steroidogenic enzyme operating in the female pathway and converting androgens into estrogens<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, hence controlling the balance of sex steroids. This gene followed a clear increasing trend of expression values towards the female categories, resulting in significant correlation and significant differential expression between male stages and mature females in our experiment.</p><p>Two possible candidates to be involved in the mechanism of sex change showed a significant down-regulation during transitional stages: <italic>sox6</italic> and <italic>foxp4</italic>. Sox6 is a transcription factor that has been found to be involved in the sex developmental pathway of vertebrates by regulating spermatogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. FoxP4 is a member of the FoxP gene family of transcription regulators whose functions and targets have yet to be determined<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. The fox genes play important roles in various biological processes, including sexual development. A transcriptomic analysis revealed very high expression levels of <italic>foxp4</italic> in the gonads of Nile Tilapia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, whereas sex-dependent changes in expression of <italic>foxp4</italic> affecting only male mammals were found<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p><p>We propose that <italic>cyp19a1b</italic> plays a central role in the mechanism of sex change in the brain of <italic>A. bicinctus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>) by modulating the balance between estrogen and androgen signaling. Both <italic>sox6</italic> and <italic>foxp4</italic> may play a role in regulating the expression of aromatase and/or other genes involved in the sex steroidogenic pathway in <italic>A. bicinctus</italic> at the brain level but the specific mechanism of action remains to be established.</p><p>Some genes encoding key neural regulators that have been shown to play major roles during sexual development and maturation in fish at the brain level such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), arginine-vasotocin (AVT), Kisspeptin (Kiss) or steroid hormones and their receptors, were not detected in our analysis. Note, however, that our study examined the brain as a whole, whereas it is well established that sex-specific differences in gene expression are present in fish when only certain brain regions are considered<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. GnRH, AVT and Kiss have been shown to be involved during sex change in other <italic>Amphiprion</italic> species, but all the studies were restricted to the hypothalamus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Similarly to our results, no significant differences in the expression levels of estrogen receptors were detected in the forebrain of bluehead wrasses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Changes at the gonadal level: a feedback loop between dmrt1 and foxl2 that regulates the estrogen/androgen balance drives sex change in A. bicinctus</title><p>Our analysis revealed a considerably higher number of transcripts showing both significant correlation to the index of sex change and significant differential expression in the gonads of <italic>A. bicinctus</italic> compared with their brains. Cluster analysis of these differentially expressed transcripts revealed three well-differentiated groups: (i) males and transitional males), (ii) transitional and immature females, and iii) mature females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). The main changes in expression related to sex change at the gonadal level started 24 days after the removal of the original female and were observed until the end of the experiment (day 50). Histological analysis indicated that male tissue was completely resorbed after 50 days and therefore the sex change process was completed, although none of the new females were spawning capable yet, as opposed to the original mature females.</p><p>Moreover, our study revealed a higher number of over-expressed transcripts at the gonadal level during the first stages of the sex change, when the transitional individuals were still acting as males, than at the end of the transition to becoming females. This is in accordance with the fact of <italic>A. bicinctus</italic> is a sequential hermaphrodite displaying ambisexual gonads with co-existing functional testicular tissues and non-functional ovarian tissues during the male-phase, whereas there are only functional ovaries in the female-phase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Up-regulation or expression of a higher number of genes is required for the maintenance of the male status of the gonads (ambisexual gonad) when compared to that required for the female status (ovarian-only). This male-bias has been observed in other fish species at the gonadal level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>.</p><p>Sexual differentiation in teleosts has been more extensively studied at the gonad than at the brain level. It is a major process that takes place after sex determination and involves the actual development of testes or ovaries from the undifferentiated gonad. Gene regulatory cascades consisting of a complex network of transcription factor interactions and signaling molecules control gonad differentiation and identity maintenance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Comparative studies on vertebrates have revealed a remarkable diversity of &#x0201c;master sex-determining genes&#x0201d; at the top of the genetic cascade by which sex is determined and maintained. In contrast, downstream components operating during these processes appear to be evolutionarily more conserved<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. This has inspired the paradigm that in sex determination and differentiation &#x0201c;masters change, slaves remain&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>.</p><p>To dissect the molecular basis of sex change at the gonadal level of <italic>A. bicinctus</italic>, we examined differences in well-known gene candidates involved in the regulatory network of sexual development. Among the downstream genes, the <italic>cyp19a1a</italic> enzyme is one of the best-studied genes known to play an important role in sex change in teleosts, as mentioned earlier. In our experiment, <italic>cyp19a1a</italic> showed a strong up-regulation in all female categories, similar to the trend found in the brain, resulting in significant correlation and significant differential expression between male and female stages. At the gonadal level, <italic>cyp19a1a</italic> is considered essential for ovarian differentiation and development in fish<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, amphibians and reptiles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. It has been widely characterized in gonads of sex-changing fishes, including the yellowtail clownfish<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, and its pivotal role in gonadal sex change in teleost fish has been extensively studied<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. The Foxl2 transcription factor also plays a decisive role in the ovarian differentiation process in various vertebrate species, including fishes. It is involved in the regulation of estrogen synthesis via direct modulation of aromatase expression and possibly the entire steroidogenic pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. This protein is also required to maintain the identity of ovarian granulosa cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. In our experiment, <italic>foxl2</italic> was markedly up-regulated in mature females, displaying a expression profile parallel to <italic>cyp19a1</italic>. A positive feedback loop regulating these two genes in fish<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> has been suggested, since <italic>foxl2</italic> regulates <italic>cyp19a1</italic>, while estrogens up-regulate <italic>foxl2</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Besides the <italic>cyp19a1a</italic> gene, another target of <italic>foxl2</italic> in the ovaries is the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (Star) whose transcriptional activity is repressed by Foxl2 in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. In our experiment, a transcript encoding Star was markedly up-regulated in mature females, resulting in differential expression compared to all the other categories. This protein controls the rate-limiting step in steroid hormone synthesis and is required for normal ovarian steroid production in mice and humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Similarly, <italic>hsd17b1</italic> was also found to be significantly up-regulated in mature females, showing significant differential expression compared to all other categories and significant correlation to the index of sex change. This gene encodes the enzyme estradiol 17&#x003b2;-dehydrogenase 1, converting low-activity estrone to high-activity 17&#x003b2;-estradiol in fish and in mammalian ovarian granulosa cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> and, along with <italic>cyp19a1</italic>, catalyzes the final steps in estradiol biosynthesis from theca cell-derived androgens<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. All these genes are key players that regulate ovarian steroidogenesis.</p><p>On the other hand, our analysis revealed three genes known to have a clear role in sex determination, testicular differentiation and spermatogenesis in teleosts: <italic>sox8</italic>, <italic>dmrt1</italic> and <italic>amh</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. These three genes were strongly up-regulated in males compared to females in our study, showing a strong negative correlation to the index of sex change. Recent work has revealed that Sox8 is an important determinant for the maintenance of testis cell identity in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> as well as a critical regulator of adult Sertoli cell function and male fertility<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>.</p><p>Sox8 regulates the expression of <italic>amh</italic> in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>, which encodes a member of the transforming growth-factor-beta gene family that mediates male sexual differentiation and development. In our study, two different transcripts encoding Amh were detected (<italic>amh1</italic> and a<italic>mh2</italic>), both displaying a steady decrease in expression values throughout the sex change. It has been proposed that Amh is an important hormone involved in the sex change of the protandrous black porgy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. In zebrafish, estrogen-induced alterations had a suppressive effect on the expression of <italic>amh</italic> and <italic>dmrt1</italic> and this was found to be associated with a disruption in male gonadal sex development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>.</p><p>On the other hand, <italic>dmrt1</italic> had a marked correlation with the index of sex change with a steady decrease in expression values. The <italic>dmrt1</italic> gene family has been found to be involved in sexual differentiation in organisms as phylogenetically divergent as corals, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, fishes, frogs, birds and mammals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. In fishes, either male-restricted or strong male-biased expression has been reported in at least twenty gonochoristic species (see review<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref> and references therein). In sequential hermaphrodites, its expression has been shown to parallel the development and regression of the testis, both in protandrous<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref> and protogynous species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. A recent study has highlighted the important role of Dmrt1 and Foxl2 in maintaining sexual cell identity. The loss of Dmrt1 in male adult mice can cause sexual transdifferentiation of testicular Sertoli cells to ovarian granulosa cells. Similarly, <italic>dmrt1</italic> expression in the ovary of mice, even in the absence of the testis-determining gene <italic>sox8</italic>, silenced <italic>foxl2</italic> and reprogrammed adult granulosa cells into Sertoli-like cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>.</p><p>Based on our results, we postulate that <italic>cyp19a1</italic> and <italic>foxl2</italic> play a pivotal role in the activation of the female pathway driving the gonadal transformation from testis to ovary during sex change in <italic>A. bicinctus</italic>, while Sox8, Dmrt1 and Amh are important for testis maintenance. All these genes have shown consistent expression profiles in previous studies of other sex-changing species, including protandrous (sharpsnout seabream<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, Asian seabass<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>, black porgy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>) and protogynous fish (bluehead wrasse<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Similarly to our study, comparison of female and male gonads in all four species have revealed a male-biased expression for <italic>dmrt1, amh</italic> and <italic>sox8</italic>/<italic>sox9</italic>, while <italic>cyp19a1</italic> and <italic>foxl2</italic> showed a female-biased profile in all but Asian seabass.</p><p>We propose a feedback loop between <italic>dmrt1</italic> and <italic>foxl2</italic> that regulates the production of the <italic>cyp19a1a</italic> enzyme and, by implication, the estrogen/androgen balance, hence controlling gonad identity change in <italic>A. bicinctus.</italic> The proposed mechanism involves a complex regulatory loop combining transcriptional regulation with steroid hormonal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p>Similarly to the brain, some well-known gene candidates involved in the regulatory network of sexual development were absent from our analysis. Wnt signaling has been implicated in a reproductive role in teleost, promoting ovarian differentiation through the upregulation of gonadal aromatase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. Our data did not reveal significant differences in expression throughout sex change of key members of the Wnt-signaling cascade, such as wnt2, wnt4, ctnnb1 (beta-catenin 1), or rspo-1. However, a female-specific function of the Wnt pathway does not seem to be a general pattern in fishes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. In addition, some key genes implicated with testicular differentiation in other fish species like wt1, gsdf or nr5a2 showed no sex-biased expression in our study.

Sixteen clownfish families were localized and tagged <italic>in situ</italic> on the exposed side of Al-Fahal reef, located 13 km off the Saudi Arabian coast in the Central Red Sea (N22.18.333, E38.57.768; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S9</xref>).</p><p>All selected families were living at depths from 4 to 20 meters and consisted of at least three individuals (the breeding pair and from 1 to 4 additional immature individuals). All individuals were measured (total length, TL, to nearest 0.1&#x02009;mm) using calipers underwater and the families were selected based on a minimum size for the breeding male of 50&#x02009;mm (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S7</xref>). Fishes were individually tagged by injecting fluorescent visible implant elastomer (VIE, Northwest Marine Technology Inc, Tumwater, WA) under the surface of their skin. These tags have no adverse effects on individual growth or survival. Additionally, numbered buoys were used to mark each family and corresponding host anemone. To reduce the stress related to the tagging process, families were not approached for two months after the last family was tagged.</p><p>Sex change was triggered by the removal of the dominant female, i.e., the largest individual from all families. Transcriptional responses were then assessed by collecting one sex-changing individual approximately every 5 days for 1.5 months to cover the full time course of the sex change process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). Extra fish were collected when possible in order to prevent potential problems during sample treatment (RNA isolation, sequencing, histology) and ensure the full coverage of the sex change process. The date of sacrifice, length, and time lapse since female removal are enumerated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S7</xref>.</p><p>In all, two functional males, 14 sex-changing individuals and corresponding 16 female partners were collected on SCUBA with hand nets. They were sedated with a clove-oil mixture (10% clove oil (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 5% ethanol, 85% sea water), carried to the boat in plastic zip-lock bags wrapped in black plastic to avoid stress from sunlight, and immediately processed on board. Fishes were euthanized using clove oil and the brain and gonads were surgically removed. The brain and one gonadal lobe were preserved in RNA<italic>later</italic> (Ambion, Austin, TX) for transcriptomic analysis. Both organs were processed on the same day upon arrival at the laboratory. The second gonadal lobe was fixed and preserved in 10% buffered formalin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).
