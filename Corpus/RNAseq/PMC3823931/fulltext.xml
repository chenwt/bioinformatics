High-coverage whole-genome sequencing of the other main subtypes, small-cell and adenocarcinoma, gave insights into carcinogenic mechanisms and disease etiology. The genomic complexity within the lung SCC subtype, as revealed by The Cancer Genome Atlas, means this subtype is likely to benefit from a more integrated approach in which the transcriptional consequences of somatic mutations are simultaneously inspected. Here we present such an approach: the integrated analysis of deep sequencing data from both the whole genome and whole transcriptome (coding and non-coding) of LUDLU-1, a SCC lung cell line. Our results show that LUDLU-1 lacks the mutational signature that has been previously associated with tobacco exposure in other lung cancer subtypes, and suggests that DNA-repair efficiency is adversely affected; LUDLU-1 contains somatic mutations in <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic>, allelic imbalance in the expression of two cancer-associated <italic>BRCA1</italic> germline polymorphisms and reduced transcription of a potentially endogenous <italic>PARP2</italic> inhibitor. Functional assays were performed and compared with a control lung cancer cell line. LUDLU-1 did not exhibit radiosensitisation or an increase in sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. However, LUDLU-1 did exhibit small but significant differences with respect to cisplatin sensitivity. Our research shows how integrated analyses of high-throughput data can generate hypotheses to be tested in the lab.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Yorkshire Cancer Research, grant number L341PG to P.R.

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) constitutes 26% of all lung cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-International1">[2]</xref>, making it one of the main histological subtypes besides small-cell and adenocarcinoma. Karyotypes of lung SCCs have revealed some commonality in the genomic landscape of these tumours, including distal amplification of 3q <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-Bass1">[3]</xref> and a more focal amplification at 8p12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-Weiss1">[4]</xref>, but as yet these findings have not translated into the clinic. SCC remains the most common lung cancer histotype for which no genomically targeted therapy currently exists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-Shigematsu1">[5]</xref>. The lack of such therapy prompted inclusion of the lung SCC subtype in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, an international collaboration aimed at cataloguing cancer-driving genetic variation within tumours using multiple high-throughput approaches. One such approach was Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), which has been used to gain insights into disease development and progression in several types of cancer, including both lung adenocarcinoma and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-Pleasance1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-Lee1">[7]</xref>. The results of TCGA study of SCC revealed marked genomic complexity within lung SCC patient samples. However, pathway-specific alterations, hoped to yield therapeutic targets, did cluster by expression subtype, indicating the importance of integrating transcriptomic information in order to understand the phenotypic consequences of the plethora of genomic changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-TheCancerGenome1">[8]</xref>. To understand how a more detailed, integrated analysis may aid inspection of lung SCC genomes, we deeply sequenced both the genome and transcriptome of LUDLU-1: a lung SCC cell line derived from a male patient whose smoking status is unknown. We also sequenced appropriate controls: the genome of an EBV-transformed lymphocyte cell from the same patient (cell line AGLCL) and the transcriptome of a normal bronchial epithelial cell line (LIMM-NBE1). To maximize our findings, we adopted an RNA sequencing method that captured both coding and non-coding RNA in a manner that retained information regarding the strand of origin. We have previously catalogued the transcriptional consequences of somatic structural variants in this cell line but here we focus on point mutations, aiming to see whether the mutational signature would give insight into disease etiology or carcinogenic mechanism, as it has for other cancer subtypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-Pleasance1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-NikZainal1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-Stead1">[10]</xref>.

Previously, the smoking status of a small cell lung cancer cell line donor was assigned via the presence of a mutational signature of tobacco exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-Pleasance1">[6]</xref>. This signature consists of an excess of G.T mutations, where G.T denotes a GC base pair being mutated to a TA base pair, and has been observed in both SCLC (34% prevalence) and lung adenocarcinoma (46% prevalence) whole genome sequencing data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-Pleasance1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-Lee1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-Liu1">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-Hainaut1">[29]</xref>. In contrast, the most common variants in LUDLU-1 were A.G (26%), and G.A transitions (24%). This implies that the LUDLU-1 somatic profile is not consistent with a smoking-based etiology for this lung SCC. However, to date, the smoking-associated somatic signature has not been validated on a genome-wide basis for lung SCC. We, therefore, downloaded data on 123,778 somatic mutations identified as part of TCGA study into clinical lung SCCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-TheCancerGenome1">[8]</xref>. These somatic mutations originated from 163 current or previous smokers, and 7 lifelong never-smokers. Surprisingly, we found that G.T transversions were the most prevalent mutation subtype in both groups, with a significantly higher proportion in the never-smokers compared to the smokers (35% versus 33%: &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2.4&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>). We compared the distribution of G.T mutation proportions across the two groups and found no significant difference (Wilcoxon, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.93). Tobacco carcinogens cause CpG.T transversions more frequently at methylated CpG dinucelotide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-Yoon1">[30]</xref> resulting in an expected increase in somatic CpG.T mutations outside of CpG islands, where 65% of CpGs are methylated compared to 15% within islands, in smokers. In contrast to this, the same proportion of somatic CpG.Ts were observed inside and outside of CpG islands in both the smoker and never-smoker groups from TCGA lung SCC data (Wilcoxon, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.86). Hence, the mutational profile of tobacco exposure is a) lacking in LUDLU-1, and b) not seen exclusively in lung SCC tumours from smokers, according to TCGA data. We examine these results further in our discussion section.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Sequencing the Transcriptome of a Lung SCC</title><p>We sequenced total RNA, after ribosomal RNA depletion, using a strand-specific method that enabled us to quantify both protein-coding and non-coding (nc)RNAs. To investigate tumour-specific expression patterns we first required a baseline of transcription in the appropriate non-diseased tissue, so we also sequenced a normal bronchial epithelial cell line that we established in-house and named LIMM-NBE1. A total of 600.4 million LUDLU-1 RNA reads aligned to the human reference genome; of these 87.5% (525.4 million) aligned uniquely, and an additional 168,546 small RNA (&#x0003c;20 bp) reads aligned to known miRNAs. Results were similar for LIMM-NBE1, where 700.8 million RNA reads aligned, of which 88.2% (618 million) did so uniquely, likewise a further 184,740 small RNA reads aligned to known miRNAs. To verify that the transcriptional profile of LIMM-NBE1 was characteristic of a bronchial epithelial cell, we inspected 27 genes listed on the Tissue Specific Gene expression Database (TiSGeD) as being highly bronchial epithelial cell-specific. There were sequenced RNA reads supporting each of these 27 genes in LIMM-NBE1; 24 (89%) exceeded the 10 RPKM threshold we used to denote expression and all but one of those exhibited above median expression in LIMM-NBE1 compared with all non-zero RPKM protein-coding genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-Xiao1">[31]</xref>. This indicates that LIMM-NBE1 has a characteristic transcriptional profile for a bronchial epithelial cell. We performed the same analysis in LUDLU-1 and found that 23 of the 27 genes (85%) exceeded the RPKM threshold for expression and all but two of those exhibited above median expression in LUDLU-1 compared with all non-zero RPKM protein-coding genes. This indicates that LUDLU-1 did, indeed, originate in the lung.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Additional Evidence of DNA Repair Deficiency</title><p>We used our RNA data to quantify expression in Reads Per Kilobase per million Mapped reads (RPKM), allowing us to inspect the relative abundance of each functional transcript class and to identify the transcripts, within each class, that exhibited the largest fold change in expression between the normal and the tumour (Supp. Table D in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078823.s002">File S2</xref>). Interestingly the largest fold change was not for a protein-coding gene but an antisense gene called <italic>RPPH1.1</italic> (Ensembl ID ENSG00000259001) that appears not to be expressed in the tumour but exhibits an RPKM of 13,194 in the bronchial epithelium; this gene is antisense to <italic>PARP2</italic>. Expression of <italic>PARP2</italic> itself shows only modest differences between our samples (62 RPKM in LUDLU-1 and 98 in the normal) but antisense transcripts can regulate their mRNA counterparts post-transcriptionally, most often, though not exclusively, resulting in decreased protein levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-Faghihi1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-Li2">[33]</xref>.

AI is commonly observed in cancer as a result of genomic alterations such as copy number changes and loss of heterozygosity. We wished to investigate the situation when one allele is preferentially expressed owing to other mechanisms such as epigenetic changes affecting, or mutations within the regulatory regions of, one allele only. We were able to do this by identifying those heterozygous variants within our tumour cell line that had a significantly different allelic ratio in the RNA compared to the DNA sequencing data, acknowledging that this will indicate the presence, but not the cause, of the phenomenon. Of the 180,985 expressed heterozygous variants in LUDLU-1, 2.1% (3792) exhibit significant AI, affecting 1949 genes.

This indicates that TCR is in effect but, in the latter case, acting on the pyrimidine i.e. repair of C&#x0003e;T on the transcribed strand. We proceeded to investigate how gene mutation rates i.e. the number of mutations per at-risk base within a gene, alter with expression for each specific mutation. Here, our results different greatly from previous findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078823-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>).

This relationship is positively correlated: an increased mutation rate is observed at higher expression levels.

Whilst we found that LUDLU-1 lacked this signature, to our surprise we found that the somatic mutational profiles from never-smokers within TCGA data did not. This raises three possibilities. Firstly, the seven never-smokers in TCGA dataset have not been accurately annotated with regards their smoking status. Alternatively, the signature (i.e. G&#x0003e;T transversions as the predominating somatic mutation with altered proportions inside and outside of CpG islands) is not a consequence of exposure to tobacco carcinogens in lung cancers. Or, finally, there are biological mechanisms unique to this SCC line, and perhaps SCC clinically, that underlie the &#x0201c;signature&#x0201d; being associated with something other than tobacco exposure. The smoking status of patients from whom TCGA samples were acquired was self-reported; there is evidence of misclassification with such annotation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-Lewis1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-Heller1">[47]</xref>. However, in order to ascertain how our findings affect the validity of a smoking-associated somatic mutational signature will require larger cohorts in which somatic mutations have been identified. We are, thus, unable to conclude the smoking status of the originator of the LUDLU-1 cell line, but cannot rule out an alternative etiology for this cancer. Whilst this manuscript was under review, a paper was published that describes signatures of mutational processes in cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-Alexandrov1">[48]</xref>. We compared the LUDLU-1 profile to those within that publication and found significant similarity with signature 5 (Supp. Figure B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078823.s001">File S1</xref>). Signature 5 was found in 93% of &#x0003e;150 lung squamous cell tumours tested, but often alongside signature 4, which significantly correlates with tobacco exposure. The etiology of signature 5 is unclear; there was some association with tobacco exposure but it was also prevalent in 7 other non smoking-associated cancers. The dominance of signature 5 in the LUDLU-1 somatic mutation profile (Supp. Figure B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078823.s001">File S1</xref>) suggests that it may be a good cell line model for testing the potential causes and consequences of this mutational profile of unclear origin.</p><p>Our approach was to perform an integrated analysis of the genome and transcriptome, as this can offer greater insight into pathogenic mechanisms than independent analysis of either dataset <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-Wu1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-Akavia1">[50]</xref>. Several findings implied that the LUDLU-1 genome has developed DNA-repair deficiency via a variety of mechanisms. A somatic substitution in LUDLU-1 is likely to lead to p53 inactivation. Knocking out <italic>Trp53</italic>, the ortholog in mice, does not directly cause cancer but increases the likelihood of spontaneous tumour formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-Donehower1">[51]</xref> owing to defective DNA repair or apoptosis. A somatic deletion in LUDLU-1 is suspected to deactivate one copy of <italic>BRCA2</italic>. Being heterozygous, this deletion is unlikely to have caused the cancer in isolation, but could contribute to the formation of a defective DNA repair background. Similarly, allelic imbalance in favour of mutant <italic>BRCA1</italic> containing 2 germline variants associated with cancer risk could contribute to a DNA-repair deficient phenotype. Finally, we found reduced expression of a potential endogenous <italic>PARP2</italic> inhibitor. Genomic abnormalities resulting in loss of DNA repair function are associated with the development of several tumours, i.e. loss of <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> genes in hereditary ovarian or breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-Krainer1">[52]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-Boyd1">[54]</xref>, or defects in the DNA mismatch repair pathway in hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-Bronner1">[55]</xref>. In these tumours an alternative pathway(s), which may not be as effective, compensates the defect in an individual repair gene/pathway. This vulnerability makes these cancers more sensitive to therapies that inhibit DNA repair. To test if this was the case in LUDLU-1, we performed functional assays to assess cisplatin, PARP-inhibitor and radiation sensitivity, compared to a control lung cancer cell line. Whilst no changes were seen in the latter two, a modest but significant increase in cisplatin sensitivity was observed. Platinum-based chemotherapy regimes are a mainstay in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. However, treatment failure is often observed and is believed to be, in part, because of the upregulation of DNA repair pathways, which remove adducts caused by the platinum-based treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-deMarinis1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-Stordal1">[57]</xref>. Tumour cells with BRCA loss have been reported to be ten to one hundred times more sensitive to cisplatin, PARP inhibitors and radiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-Evers1">[58]</xref>. The lack of radio-sensitivity and PARP insensitivity in LUDLU-1 cells suggest that the remaining wild-type copies of BRCA genes in this cell line provide sufficient functionality, or that alternative pathways can fully compensate for the heterozygous loss of functional <italic>BRCA1</italic> and increase in a single <italic>BRCA2</italic> allele, in response to these specific treatments. However, a deficiency in DNA-repair is apparent, and incompletely compensated to increase cisplatin-induced cell killing. This indicates that LUDLU-1 provides a good model for further experimentation into DNA repair phenotypes in the lung SCC subtype, the results of which can be evaluated in light of the DNA and RNA sequencing data provided.</p><p>The value of whole genome sequencing has been questioned when exon sequencing, possible with much larger sample numbers, can deliver tumour markers and drug targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0078823-Biesecker1">[59]</xref>. However, our in-depth cross-platform analysis of a single sample has allowed us to speculate on underlying mechanisms of tumourigenesis and predict that hyper-mutation was caused by DNA-repair deficiencies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0078823.s001"><label>File S1</label><caption><p><bold>Supplemental Figure A.
