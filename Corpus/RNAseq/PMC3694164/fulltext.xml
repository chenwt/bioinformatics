However, trypanosomes also undergo development within the mammalian bloodstream as they progress from morphologically &#x02018;slender forms&#x02019; to transmissible &#x02018;stumpy forms&#x02019; through morphological intermediates. This transition is temporally progressive within the first wave of parasitaemia such that gene expression can be monitored in relatively pure slender and stumpy populations as well as during the progression between these extremes. The development also represents the progression of cells from translationally active forms adapted for proliferation in the host to translationally quiescent forms, adapted for transmission. We have used metabolic labelling to quantitate translational activity in slender forms, stumpy forms and in forms undergoing early differentiation to procyclic forms <italic>in vitro</italic>. Thereafter we have examined the cohort of total mRNAs that are enriched throughout development in the mammalian bloodstream (slender, intermediate and stumpy forms), irrespective of strain, revealing those that exhibit consistent developmental regulation rather than sample specific changes. Transcripts that cosediment with polysomes in stumpy forms and slender forms have also been enriched to identify transcripts that escape translational repression prior to transmission. Combined, the expression and polysomal association of transcripts as trypanosomes undergo development in the mammalian bloodstream have been defined, providing a resource for trypanosome researchers. This facilitates the identification of those that undergo developmental regulation in the bloodstream and therefore those likely to have a role in the survival and capacity for transmission of stumpy forms.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a Wellcome Trust Programme grant to KM and by a Wellcome Trust Strategic award to the Centre for Immunity, Infection and Evolution at the University of Edinburgh.

As parasite numbers accumulate in the bloodstream of a mammalian host through the division of proliferative slender forms, a putative signal that acts as a stumpy induction factor (SIF) is proposed to accumulate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Vassella1">[11]</xref>. This factor (or factors) is detected by the parasites in the circulation and once sufficient signal accumulates, cell cycle arrest is stimulated, leading to the development of stumpy forms. Although the molecular details of stumpy formation are not precisely characterised, differentiation follows a temporally predictable procession of events, involving down regulation of the expression of the parasite haptoglobin-heamoglobin receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Vanhollebeke1">[14]</xref>, cell cycle arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Shapiro1">[15]</xref>, activation of the expression of ESAG9 proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Barnwell1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Jensen1">[17]</xref> and the expression of PAD mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Dean1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Macgregor1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Macgregor2">[19]</xref>. These events are followed by the morphological transformation of parasites to stumpy forms from intermediate forms. Such changes involve the elaboration of the parasite mitochondrion (in preparation for the switch to a mitochondrial based respiration in the tsetse mid-gut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Vickerman1">[20]</xref>), expansion of the parasite&#x02019;s lysosome and flagellar pocket <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Vanhollebeke1">[14]</xref> and migration of the nucleus toward the posterior end of the cell. Nuclear migration can be such that the terminal kinetoplast can be displaced leading to a postero-nuclear phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-MacGregor1">[5]</xref>.</p><p>Although the signals underlying the stimulation of stumpy formation are unknown, quantitative analysis of the production and maintenance of stumpy forms in a chronic bloodstream form infection has allowed modelling of several key parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Macgregor2">[19]</xref>. For example, the bloodstream trypanosome population is predicted to be composed of uncommitted slender cells (i.e. those that will continue to replicate indefinitely), committed slender cells (those that have detected the SIF signal and are undergoing limited further divisions before cell cycle arrest), intermediate forms (that are irreversibly division arrested but have not yet undergone morphological transformation to stumpy forms) and stumpy forms themselves. From analyses of the development of the first wave of parasitaemia, and further analysis of the proportion of stumpy cells in long term established infections, only slender cells (whether committed or uncommitted) were predicted to produce SIF. Cells that become committed were predicted to undergo around three cell divisions prior to irreversible arrest as intermediate forms, which then differentiate over 48 h to produce morphologically stumpy forms with a lifespan of a further 48&#x02013;72 h. The consequence of this temporal programme is that intermediate and stumpy forms comprise the majority of a chronic bloodstream infection and trypanosome infections are therefore optimised for transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-MacGregor1">[5]</xref>. This is an important consideration as most molecular analyses of trypanosomes focus on the proliferative slender forms but in the context of chronic infection, intermediate and stumpy forms may represent the dominant cell types.</p><p>In the experiments described here we have analysed gene expression in the different developmental forms that characterise natural trypanosome infections in the mammalian bloodstream. In kinetoplastid parasites, the organisation of the genome into polycistronic arrays necessitates that regulated gene expression is overwhelmingly governed by post-transcriptional mechanisms, particularly mRNA abundance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Clayton1">[21]</xref>. However, the importance of translational control is also increasingly recognised as a key regulatory step, such that mRNA abundance and the expression of gene protein products do not always correlate in eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Lahav1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Greenbaum1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Anderson1">[24]</xref>. This is particularly evident in the generation of stumpy forms, where the global translation of trypanosome genes has been observed to be considerably reduced with respect to both bloodstream slender and procyclic forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Brecht1">[25]</xref>. In order to examine such regulatory events we have carried out analyses of two processes associated with trypanosome infection. Firstly, we have examined the progressive changes in gene expression that accompany the transition from slender forms, through intermediate forms, to stumpy forms in two distinct trypanosome strains. This identified mRNAs that show regulatory trends through development, aiding the ability to separate developmental changes in RNA from sample specific or procedural specific changes, such as changes associated with cell isolation procedures. Secondly, we have analysed those mRNAs that co-sediment with polysomal material in either slender or stumpy forms. These polysomally-enriched transcripts are more likely to be actively translated, or poised ready for translation, and will reveal transcripts in stumpy forms that actively escape global translational repression. These are likely to be important in transmission processes, such as during establishment in the tsetse fly. Combined, these data sets provide a resource for understanding how trypanosomes develop in the mammalian bloodstream in order to ensure their successful passage to their tsetse vector.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Analysis of Translation During Trypanosoma Brucei Development</title><p>The relative translation of slender and stumpy forms has been previously studied by analysis of their polysome profiles, indicating that stumpy forms exhibit reduced protein synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Brecht1">[25]</xref>. In order to confirm this and to determine when translational repression becomes relieved during the differentiation to procyclic forms, the rate of radiolabelled methionine incorporation into <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis was determined in slender and stumpy forms as well as during the <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation between stumpy and procyclic forms. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067069-g001">Figure 1A</xref> shows that the <sup>35</sup>S methionine incorporation in slender and stumpy forms was 125% and 33%, relative to cultured procyclic forms (normalised to 100%), respectively. During <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation of stumpy to procyclic forms, the rate of <sup>35</sup>S methionine incorporation remained low for the first four hours of differentiation (33&#x02013;49% of procyclic form levels) then rapidly increased to 88% of procyclic levels between 4 and 8 hours. Although there was a strong increase in label incorporation into protein, analysis by SDS PAGE did not resolve major discrete bands showing an &#x02018;immediate early&#x02019; synthesis; between 0 and 8 hours the resolved profile was not detectably different (the profile of labelled proteins at 0h and 8h is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067069-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).

These two independent strains follow similar developmental kinetics and biological characteristics during the slender to stumpy transition and were used to aid the identification of mRNAs whose abundance changed consistently upon development from slender to stumpy forms irrespective of parasite strain. This was an important consideration given the variation in transcript levels observed in different studies of developmental gene expression in trypanosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Jensen1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Queiroz1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Kabani1">[28]</xref>.

Adapter sequences and short or poor quality reads were trimmed from the data using Trimmomatic and aligned using SMALT v0.6.4 with a maximum of 2 mismatches per read and multiple mappings given a score of 0. The alignment index for SMALT was created with a word length of 11 from the most recent GeneDB trypanosome contigs (version: 13/03/2012) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genedb.org/Homepage/Tbruceibrucei927">http://www.genedb.org/Homepage/Tbruceibrucei927</ext-link>) with ORFs extended using the predicted UTR data from the Cross Laboratory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Siegel1">[30]</xref>.

Pairwise comparisons of the relative expression of transcripts between life cycle stages were performed using the DESeq 1.11.2 package within R 2.15.1 using a binomial model and a blind variance stabilising transformation, this normalising for variation in raw read counts from individual samples. A generous p-value cut-off of 0.1 was used to support the differential expression of transcripts. It should be noted that the number of replicates used did not allow a robust analysis of false discovery rate so experimental sampling was also used to support the expression profile of transcripts likely to show developmental regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Developmental Regulation of mRNA Families: Pathway Analysis</title><p>Comparison between the two strains of <italic>T. brucei</italic> either as slender, intermediate or stumpy forms revealed similar expression profiles, with correlation coefficient R<sup>2</sup> values of 0.81, 0.78 and 0.83 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067069-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Pair-wise comparisons between the life cycle stages identified several transcripts that differ between life cycle stages (<italic>Data File S1</italic>; for completeness all transcripts are included regardless of the inter-strain variance). The mRNA profiles of intermediate and stumpy forms were almost identical with a correlation coefficient R<sup>2</sup> of 0.97, highlighting the fact that cells have committed to transmission and quiescence long before morphological changes are apparent. Both intermediate and stumpy form transcript profiles correlate somewhat with slender forms, but to a lesser degree (R<sup>2</sup> of 0.76 for stumpy cells, R<sup>2</sup> of 0.82 for intermediates). This analysis identified 61 transcripts whose abundance was &#x02265;2 fold in stumpy forms compared to slender forms and 43 were &#x02265;3 fold more abundant (<italic>Data File</italic> S2). Of those transcripts showing an abundance of &#x02265;2 fold, 29 (48%) were already elevated in intermediate forms with respect to slender forms, again confirming that many changes in transcript abundance occur early in the development to stumpy forms. Those elevated in intermediate forms (with respect to fold change in comparison to slender forms) (<italic>Data File S</italic>3) included PSSA-2 (<italic>Tb</italic>927.10.11220) and MAPK2 (<italic>Tb</italic>927.10.16030), the latter being involved in the proliferation of procyclic form parasites upon differentiation in the tsetse mid-gut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Muller1">[32]</xref>.

Among the stumpy-enriched transcripts were several that affect transmission to the tsetse stage of the infection.

In common with intermediate cells, there are nucleolar-associated transcripts that are enriched that may be involved in quiescence (NOG1 <italic>Tb</italic>11.02.0620). Reassuringly, several transcripts previously identified as being elevated in stumpy forms are present in our dataset. These include the purine nucleoside transporter NT10 (<italic>Tb</italic>09.160.5480) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Sanchez1">[35]</xref> and the previously mentioned <italic>Tb</italic>PIP39, as well as most of the cohort of stumpy enriched mRNAs detected by Nimblegen analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Jensen1">[17]</xref>.

Of these, the majority (15/31) were designated &#x02018;hypothetical&#x02019;, and several (9/31) had a predicted or known mitochondrial function, as expected in transmission adapted forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Zhang1">[40]</xref>. For non-mitochondrial proteins, heat shock and calpain-like cysteine peptidases were present. In contrast to total mRNA, only 2/31 of the polysome enriched stumpy transcripts show a differentiation phenotype in the previously published RITSeq targeted RNAi library. Conversely 13/31 show a significant defect in slender bloodstream survival if targeted by RNAi. This would suggest that while total mRNA of stumpy forms show a trend towards transcripts involved in transmission, polysome associated transcripts are more likely involved in cell maintenance and viability. Among the transcripts three fold or more depleted in the polysomal fraction compared to total RNA for stumpy forms there was a strong emphasis (103/212; 49%) on ribosomal proteins and proteins associated with ribosomal assembly, highlighting that the stumpy forms are quiescent and translationally repressed. In contrast, the large amount of ribosome associated transcript present in the total stumpy mRNA may enable translation to be rapidly re-activated when the differentiation signal is received in the tsetse mid-gut. PAD2 was also shown to be strongly depleted in the polysomal fractions despite its elevated abundance in total stumpy form mRNA, reflecting that this protein is not strongly translated in stumpy forms until exposure to cold shock and differentiation conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Dean1">[10]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067069-g007">Figure 7</xref>).

polysomal fraction was also compared with the abundance transcripts in the monomorphic slender polysomal fraction (<italic>Data File S7</italic>). Although the data came from different parasite strains, we sought to identify transcripts preferentially enriched in stumpy form polysomes relative to slender forms: we identified 60 transcripts enriched &#x0003e;3 fold. Several genes involved in cell cycle control were enriched in the stumpy form polysomes compared to the proliferative slender form, including Cyclin 7 (<italic>Tb</italic>927.6.5020), UMSBP (<italic>Tb</italic>927.10.6060) and <italic>Tb</italic>NST (<italic>Tb</italic>11.02.0240). Conversely, some of the most significantly depleted genes in the stumpy polysomal material are those that would be expected to be needed for cell division and growth, such as &#x003b2; and &#x003b1;-tubulin, lipin and various histone and riboprotein complexes. Further analysis of this dataset involved comparison with the surface phylome analysis of slender and stumpy forms, to identify transcripts that were predicted to be membrane associated and polysomally enriched in stumpy forms, hence revealing molecules potentially important in transmission capacity (<italic>Data File S</italic>8). This subset included GRESAG4 family members, amino acid transporter family members, purine nucleoside transporters, ESAG3 pseudogenes and trans-sialidases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The generation of bloodstream stumpy forms of <italic>T. brucei</italic> is associated with cell cycle arrest and translational repression as the parasites await uptake in a tsetse blood meal. They also show pre-adaptation for transmission, including the partial activation of their mitochondrion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Vickerman2">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Priest1">[42]</xref>, such that upon transmission they can rapidly undergo the developmental changes necessary for colonisation of the tsetse fly mid-gut. Here, we have described the progression from translational arrest to translational reactivation during differentiation to procyclic forms, demonstrating that this occurs around 4&#x02013;6 hours after differentiation is triggered with cis-aconitate. Moreover, we analysed the transcriptome of intermediate and stumpy forms from two different strains in order to identify the consistent adaptations that accompany development of the parasite&#x02019;s transmission stage. Finally, we have analysed the transcripts that associate with polysomal material, reflecting transcripts that either escape translational silencing in stumpy forms (and hence may be important at this life cycle stage for survival or transmission) or those associated with high molecular weight RNP complexes, potentially regulating their expression positively or negatively. This provides a useful complement to direct analyses of protein synthesis via approaches such SILAC labelling, for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Urbaniak1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Gunasekera1">[44]</xref>. Indeed these studies provide different read outs, one being a snapshot of mRNAs associating with polysomal fractions in the stumpy form, the other revealing proteins actively made in slender or procyclic forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Urbaniak1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Gunasekera1">[44]</xref>, with proteins synthesised in stumpy forms being inferred by comparison of unlabelled peptides against those in the labelled sample <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Gunasekera1">[44]</xref>. Since this does not involve the direct labelling of synthesised proteins in stumpy forms, proteins made throughout the transition from intermediate to stumpy forms would be identified, as well as those actively made in only stumpy forms, whereas procyclic proteins already synthesised in stumpy forms might be underrepresented. Hence SILAC might over-assign proteins translated in stumpy forms, whereas polysome analysis of stumpy forms would contain actively translated transcripts, but also transcripts associated with ribonucleoprotein complexes that co-sediment with translating ribosomes. In combination these different approaches are valuable and complementary, therefore.</p><p>Several publications have described the transcriptome and proteome profile of the different developmental stages of kinetoplastid parasites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Tsigankov1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Minning1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Atwood1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Paape1">[48]</xref>.

These have been based on glass slide microarrays, Nimblegen arrays and, more recently, quantitatively more powerful next generation sequencing transcriptome studies. Of the latter, only one study has analysed by RNAseq approaches the expression profile of pleomorphic slender and stumpy forms derived from rodent infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Nilsson1">[49]</xref>. These data are more representative of parasites in the field but were limited in biological sample number, such that material was analysed from single slender and stumpy RNA preparations. Hence, these are potentially subject to non-systematic variations resulting from growth in vivo, the given strain analysed and parasite isolation procedures. This variation is apparent when comparing the genes enriched in stumpy cells in different analyses with those enriched in stumpy cells in our study, although we found the best agreement (p&#x0003c;0.001, using a Monte Carlo simulation using 1000 iterations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Durrani1">[50]</xref>) with the study by Jensen and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Jensen1">[17]</xref> (<italic>Data File S9</italic>). The importance of different isolation procedures for different studies is revealed in the SILAC analysis of stumpy forms where PAD2 was seen to be strongly expressed, likely reflective of parasite cold shock or the induction of early differentiation events during isolation procedures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Gunasekera1">[44]</xref>.</p><p>In the study described here we have used Digital SAGE (based on its lower cost and so potential for the analysis of more biological samples) and analysed RNA preparations from two distinct strains of pleomorphic trypanosomes, and included RNA from intermediate forms in addition to slender and stumpy forms. This provides useful information because (i) consistent expression changes associated with the developmental form rather than parasite strain can be identified and (ii) the trends in expression during the transformation from slender to stumpy forms via intermediate forms provides a reassurance for transcripts whose expression becomes progressively increased or decreased during the transition to transmissible stages. Both components add value to the dataset, allowing genes whose expression fluctuates dramatically under different conditions (potentially unrelated to development) to be identified as well as transcripts elevated early in the development to transmission stages.</p><p>Matching earlier studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Gunasekera1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Nilsson1">[49]</xref>, mitochondrial transcripts and proteins were among those most elevated during development to stumpy forms. However, Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with translation, ribonuclear complexes and macromolecular biosynthetic processes were also enriched, emphasising the preadaptation of stumpy forms to onward development in the tsetse fly. This was further supported by analyses of the enriched metabolic pathways in stumpy forms, where there was the expected up regulation of TCA cycle components, oxidative phosphorylation, amino acid metabolism as well as components associated with ribosomal components. Glycolysis was down regulated. The dataset of enriched transcripts was also analysed with respect to their surface phylome categories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Jackson1">[38]</xref> in order to identify membrane-associated molecules potentially up-regulated in stumpy forms, and of importance for transmission or stumpy form viability. This highlighted the up-regulation of amino acid transporters, purine nucleoside transporters (including the previously characterised NT10, enriched in stumpy and procyclic forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Sanchez1">[35]</xref>), and surface carboxylate transporters of the PAD family. Additionally, two magnesium transporter proteins of the CorA type Mgt2 family were identified in the stumpy enriched set. These proteins have been previously characterised in <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Zhu1">[39]</xref> and proposed to have ER association. Moreover, the Mgt proteins show developmental regulation, with Mgt2 in particular affecting parasite virulence and development from promastigotes to amastigotes. Additionally, an mRNA encoding a protein with a predicted CRAL-TRIO domain was identified among the transcripts significantly enriched in stumpy forms. Further analysis of this molecule confirmed its developmental regulation between slender and stumpy forms by qRT PCR and Northern blotting. However, RNAi mediated knock down of this transcript in pleomorphic parasites did not reveal a detectable phenotype during development from slender to stumpy forms <italic>in vivo</italic>, nor during differentiation to procyclic forms <italic>in vitro</italic>. Hence this molecule represents a candidate with a role for establishment in the tsetse fly, rather than the differentiation process <italic>per se</italic>. A similar observation would be expected with another of the enriched phylome categories, namely trans-sialidases. These scavenge sialic acid from the blood-meal of the tsetse fly and protect the parasite from the insect&#x02019;s midgut environment, aiding parasite transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Nagamune1">[51]</xref>.</p><p>Polysomal associated material was also analysed in stumpy forms to assist the identification of transcripts that might escape the overall translational repression characteristic of this transmission stage. However, transcripts associated with larger ribonuclear complexes that could play a positive or negative role in the expression of the associated mRNAs (e.g. transcripts poised for translation but not actively translated; stress granule or P body complexes) might also be identified by this approach. Nonetheless, the measured global translational quiescence of stumpy forms was also emphasised by the depletion of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins in the stumpy polysomal material. Moreover, comparison of the proteins preferentially expressed in stumpy forms and the transcripts enriched in the stumpy polysomal material with respect to slender polysomal material showed a higher degree of overlap with SILAC proteome studies then would be expected by chance (assessed using a Monte Carlo simulation of the distribution, p value&#x0003c;0.001 (<italic>Data File S9</italic>)). When analysed for regulatory motifs by the Regulatory Sequences Analysis Tool (RSAT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-vanHelden1">[52]</xref>, the 3&#x02032;UTRs of transcripts that were polysome-enriched in either slender or stumpy forms revealed that the motif TTATT was over-represented in polysomal stumpy transcripts (<italic>Data File S10</italic>). A similar motif was also identified when analysing procyclic enriched transcripts in a previous study by the same approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Mayho1">[53]</xref>.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The comparison between different strains of trypanosomes revealed that developmental responses at the mRNA level were sufficiently similar to be considered biological replicates of the same material. Moreover, comparison of the transcriptome datasets revealed good agreement for those transcripts previously highlighted as being up-regulated in either slender or stumpy forms based on Nimblegen analysis in another trypanosome strain, <italic>T. brucei</italic> TREU927/4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0067069-Jensen1">[17]</xref>. Thus the biological events that trypanosomes undergo as they prepare for transmission are quite predictable and consistent regardless of strain, reflective of an underlying developmental pathway. By identifying the genes that are controlled in slender, intermediate and stumpy forms in the blood, genes that are coincidently, or differentially regulated can be identified. This assists an analysis of the temporal mRNA hierarchy that bloodstream trypanosomes employ as they perceive and respond to the parasite-derived density-sensing signal as an adaptation for transmission. Analyses of the transcripts that cosediment with polysomes also reveals transcripts actively translated, as well as those associated with high molecular weight RNP complexes. Integration of this information with studies of the proteins present at each life cycle stage by proteome studies will assist understanding of how trypanosomes prepare for transmission through holding transcripts poised for translation as well as actively translating transcripts when the bulk of mRNAs are translationally quiescent.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Animal experiments in this work were carried out in accordance with, and approved by, the Ethical Review Committee of the University of Edinburgh and were carried out under a project licence (60/4373) issued under the UK Home Office Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act (1986).</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Trypanosomes</title><p><italic>Trypanosoma brucei bru</italic>cei AnTat1.1 was used for the derivation of material from slender, intermediate and stumpy forms, transcriptome analysis and validation by qRT PCR and Northern blotting.
