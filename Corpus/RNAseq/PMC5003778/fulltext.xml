However, the rarity of LSCs within the primitive hematopoietic cell compartment remains a major limiting factor for their study in humans. Here we show that primitive hematopoietic cells with typical LSC features, including adhesion defect, increased long-term survival and proliferation, and innate resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib, can be generated <italic>de novo</italic> from reprogrammed primary CML cells. Using CML iPSC-derived primitive leukemia cells, we discovered olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4) as a novel factor that contributes to survival and growth of somatic lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup> cells from bone marrow of patients with CML in chronic phase, but not primitive hematopoietic cells from normal bone marrow. Overall, this study shows the feasibility and advantages of using reprogramming technology to develop strategies for targeting primitive leukemia cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p id="P2">CML is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by unregulated growth of predominantly myeloid cells, and their subsequent accumulation in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. CML originates in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) translocation, which causes the constitutive expression of the BCR-ABL kinase driving the expansion of leukemic progeny (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Holtz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Holyoake et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Ramaraj et al., 2004</xref>). <italic>Ex vivo</italic> cultures of CML-derived cell lines and primary CML cells, ectopic expression of BCR-ABL in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells and mouse models have provided important insights into CML pathogenesis and led to the development of targeted therapy for this neoplastic disease with BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), imatinib (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Druker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Druker et al., 2001</xref>). Despite these achievements, eradication of CML remains challenging. Although the majority of patients treated with imatinib achieve a complete cytogenetic response, discontinuation of imatinib treatment is commonly associated with relapse (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Mahon et al., 2010</xref>). Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the major cause of disease persistence is innate resistance of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) to TKIs (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Corbin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Graham et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Holyoake et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, studies of primitive leukemia cells are essential for better understanding leukemia pathogenesis and developing curative therapies for CML. Due to the limited number of BCR-ABL<sup>+</sup> cells within the most primitive hematopoietic cell compartments (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Holyoake et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Holyoake et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">Vargaftig et al., 2012</xref>), establishing technologies for <italic>de novo</italic> generation of LSC-like cells would provide a significant benefit to the CML field.</p><p id="P3">Reprogramming human somatic cells to pluripotency allows for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that behave similarly to embryonic stem cells (ESCs), i.e., they are capable of self-renewal, large-scale expansion, and differentiation toward derivatives of all three germ layers, including blood (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Choi et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2009</xref>). Because iPSCs capture the entire genome of diseased cells, they are already being used in modeling human genetic diseases (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Grskovic et al., 2011</xref>). Recently, we and other groups successfully generated iPSCs from primary CML cells and showed that CML-iPSCs capture the genetic alterations present in leukemia cells, and possess the ability to produce differentiated leukemia cells (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Bedel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Kumano et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we tested the hypothesis that reprogramming CML cells to pluripotency and then differentiating them back into blood cells can be used as a novel approach to produce an unlimited number of primitive hematopoietic cells with LSC properties and identify novel primitive leukemia cell survival factors and drug targets. We validated this hypothesis by demonstrating the successful application of the iPSC-based platform to discover OLFM4 as a novel primitive leukemia cell survival factor in patients in the chronic phase of CML. This finding provides a basis for development of novel approaches for treating CML by targeting OLFM4 or OLFM4-mediated signaling pathways in primitive leukemia cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>2.

Similar to somatic CML LSCs, day 9 CML iPSC-derived CD45<sup>+</sup> cells had ALDH activity and were able to efflux Rhodamine-123 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c-d</xref>). After expansion for 2 days, CD45<sup>+</sup> cells retained expression of CD34 and CD90 and CD117 stem cell markers and remained lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and CD45RA<sup>&#x02212;</sup>. However, up to 25% of the population acquired CD38 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, day 11) and the levels of ALDH<sup>high</sup> and Rho<sup>low</sup> cells within CD45<sup>+</sup> population decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c and d</xref>).

Therefore, next we evaluated whether <italic>de novo</italic> generated CML iCD34<sup>+</sup> cells possess similar properties. By analyzing the growth of iCD34<sup>+</sup> cells in serum-free medium with growth factors, we found an enhanced expansion of iCD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells from CML iPSCs relative to similar cells from normal BM iPSCs. Treatment with imatinib decreased expansion of CML iCD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells to the level observed in normal BM iCD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). CML iCD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells also generated significantly more and larger myeloid colonies as compared to normal BM iCD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Although we did not see differences in the number of colonies between CML and BM cells within CD38<sup>&#x02212;</sup> compartment, CML iCD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells consistently generated larger colonies. Using the LTC-IC assay, we found that CML iCD34<sup>+</sup> cells produced a much higher number of LTC-IC-derived CFCs than BM iCD34<sup>+</sup> cells, indicating an increase in long-term survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In serum-free cultures, CML iCD34<sup>+</sup> cells were able to withstand growth factor deprivation in both CD38<sup>+</sup> and CD38<sup>&#x02212;</sup> compartments, which was reversed by treatment with imatinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). CML iCD34<sup>+</sup> cells also showed reduced adhesion to fibronectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2ei</xref>), which was partially restored by imatinib treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2eii</xref>). Overall, these findings provide strong evidence that iCD34<sup>+</sup> cells derived from CML iPSCs behave similarly to their somatic LSC counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>2.2. Induced LSC-like cells are resistant to imatinib</title><p id="P8">The dependence of CML cells on BCR-ABL signaling enables the suppression of the disease by TKIs. However, resistances of CML LSCs to imatinib preclude a complete cure for CML (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Corbin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Graham et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Holyoake et al., 2001</xref>). Analysis of BCR-ABL expression by qPCR and Western blot demonstrated that BCR-ABL mRNA and protein, including phosphorylated protein (p-BCR-ABL) were present in undifferentiated CML iPSCs and their iCD34<sup>+</sup> and iCD34<sup>&#x02212;</sup> progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a and b</xref>). Interestingly, expression of BCR-ABL mRNA was greater in undifferentiated CML iPSCs when compared to parental bone marrow CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. However, in iCD34<sup>+</sup> cells, the level of BCR-ABL expression downregulated to the level observed in parental CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. Evaluation of the phosphorylation status of the BCR-ABL-specific substrate CRK-like protein (CRKL) revealed the presence of a phosphorylated form of CRKL (p-CRKL) in CML, but not in the control BM iCD34<sup>+</sup> and iCD34<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>), thus providing evidence that BCR-ABL is active in CML iPSC-derived hematopoietic progeny.</p><p id="P9">Studies in CML patients have shown that imatinib inhibits BCR-ABL kinase and cell proliferation in primitive hematopoietic compartments without affecting survival of LSCs (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Copland et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Corbin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Graham et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Holtz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Schemionek et al., 2010</xref>). To find out whether <italic>de novo</italic> generated CML iCD34<sup>+</sup> cells respond to imatinib in a similar fashion, we evaluated the effect of imatinib on these cells in vitro. After treatment with imatinib for 4 h, p-CRKL dramatically decreased in both primitive iCD34<sup>+</sup> and in more mature iCD34<sup>&#x02212;</sup> blood cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c and d</xref>). This indicates that imatinib efficiently inhibits the majority of BCR-ABL kinase activity in <italic>de novo</italic> generated CML cells, independent of the stage of maturation. The inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase in iCD34<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells by imatinib treatment was associated with increased apoptosis as determined by using Annexin V staining and caspase 3/7 fluorogenic substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e and fii</xref>). In contrast, imatinib failed to induce apoptosis in CML iCD34<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3fi</xref>), despite the abrogation of p-CRKL signaling in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c and d</xref>). The increased resistance to imatinib within the more primitive hematopoietic compartment was also evident from a significant increase of inhibitory concentration 50% (IC<sub>50</sub>) for CML iCD34<sup>+</sup> cells as compared to CML iCD34<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3gi</xref>).

Imatinib treatment of CML iCD34<sup>+</sup> cell cultures was associated with a significant increase of slowly dividing CD34<sup>+</sup> cells (generations 2&#x02013;4) in bulk cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S2a and b</xref>) and retention of CD34<sup>+</sup> expression by rapidly dividing cells (generations 5&#x02013;7; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S2c</xref>) as compared to non-treated cells. Annexin V staining of CFSE-labeled cell cultures revealed that the most primitive iCD34<sup>bright</sup> cells were resistant to imatinib-induced apoptosis, while a substantial increase in apoptosis was observed in iCD34<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells and in more mature and proliferative iCD34<sup>dim</sup> cells the majority of which were CD38<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S2d&#x02013;f</xref>).

According to AceView analysis (<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Thierry-Mieg and Thierry-Mieg, 2006</xref>), transcription of human <italic>OLFM4</italic> produces 5 different mRNAs (OLFM4a&#x02013;OLFM4e) encoding four alternatively spliced variants and one unspliced variant. These mRNAs encode four complete proteins, including OLFM4a and OLFM4d secreted isoforms and OLFM4b and OLFM4c cytoplasmic isoforms. OLFM4e isoform is reconstructed from partial mRNA and is not fully characterized (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/Research/Acembly/av.cgi?db=human&#x00026;c=Gene&#x00026;l=OLFM4">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/Research/Acembly/av.cgi?db=human&#x00026;c=Gene&#x00026;l=OLFM4</ext-link>).

Using RT-PCR, we detected OLFM4 mRNAs in sCD34<sup>+</sup> cells isolated from all CML patients. However, in contrast to iCD34<sup>+</sup> cells generated <italic>de novo</italic> from CML iPSCs, sCD34<sup>+</sup> cells from CML patients expressed a restricted range of OLFM4 isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a and b</xref>). Cytoplasmic OLFM4b isoform was found in sCD34<sup>+</sup> cells from all CML patients, while none of the patients showed expression of isoform OLFM4e. The expression of cytoplasmic OLFM4c isoform, and secreted OLFM4a and OLFM4d iso-forms varied between patients, but none of the patients expressed the entire range of isoforms. In contrast, sCD34<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells expressed all range of isoforms, although isoform e was not detected in some patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a and b</xref>). None of the OLFM4 isoforms were detectable in normal bone marrow sCD34<sup>+</sup> cells by PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). To examine whether OLFM4 is expressed in primitive CML cells in situ, we performed immunofluorescent staining of BM biopsies from normal individuals and patients in the chronic phase of CML. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5c</xref>, OLFM4 was detected in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells from CML patients, but not in normal donors. In contrast, CD34<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells showed OLFM4 protein expression in both normal and CML biopsies. To confirm the production of OLFM4 by the most primitive CML cells, we evaluated OLFM4 secretion by sCD34<sup>+</sup> (lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup>) cells isolated from P1 and P6 following the short-term in vitro cultures. Using ELISA, we detected OLFM4 protein in sCD34<sup>+</sup> cultures from CML patients, while the OLFM4 levels in control BM cultures were not exceeded background level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Since previous studies have demonstrated the induction of OLFM4 expression by G-CSF in myeloid progenitors (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Chin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>), we tested whether G-CSF enhances OLFM4 production in sCD34<sup>+</sup> cells from CML patients. We found that G-CSF stimulation indeed enhances OLFM4 production by sCD34<sup>+</sup> cells and that this effect is potentiated by imatinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). To confirm the specificity of G-CSF effect, we cultured sCD34<sup>+</sup> cells from patient P6 with G-SCF and G-SCF blocking monoclonal antibody. The level of OLFM4 production in presence of antibody was reduced from 205 pg/ml to 47.5 pg/ml.</p><p id="P16">To assess whether OLFM4 provides a survival advantage for CML sCD34<sup>+</sup> cells, we performed CFC assay after a 24 h treatment with imatinib, siOLFM4, or both. Consistent with prior observations in iCD34<sup>+</sup> cells, CML cells in clonogenic cultures displayed a significant upregulation of <italic>OLFM4</italic> expression when pretreated with imatinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>).

Knockdown of OLFM4 in CML sCD34<sup>+</sup> cells using siRNA potentiated the inhibitory effect of imatinib on CFCs, which was reversed by pretreatment of cells with OLFM4 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). In contrast, no significant effect was observed following similar treatments of sCD34<sup>+</sup> cells from BM of three normal donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>).</p><p id="P17">To determine whether OLFM4 provides a survival advantage for cells more primitive than CFCs and whether it can affect the response of these cells to imatinib, we performed an LTC-IC assay using CML sCD34<sup>+</sup> cells treated with siOLFM4, imatinib or both together. Consistent with previous studies (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Bellodi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Corbin et al., 2011</xref>), imatinib had little effect on somatic LTC-ICs. In contrast, treatment of cells with siOLFM4 significantly reduced OLFM4 production in sCD34<sup>+</sup> cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>) and the number of colonies in LTC-IC cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Addition of imatinib to siOLFM4-treated cultures had no significant impact on LTC-IC numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>). Both imatinib and siOLFM4 treatment did not affect substantially the proportion of BCR-ABL positive colonies from LTC-IC cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). The observed effect of OLFM4 knockdown on the LTC-ICs was different from the one we observed with less primitive leukemia cells, CFCs. While OLFM4 downregulation alone had minimal effect on CFCs, it significantly augmented the inhibitory effect of imatinib on these progenitors. In contrast, OLFM4 knockdown alone was able to abrogate LTC-ICs and no synergistic action was observed between OLFM4 knockdown and imatinib treatment, thereby suggesting that OLFM4-mediated survival of the most primitive CML cells may not depend on BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling. Although our studies indicate that knockdown of OLFM4 in sCD34<sup>+</sup> cells affects primitive CML cell survival in vitro, it remains unclear whether this effect is mediated through cell-intrinsic pathways or through paracrine signaling. Following culture, lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup> cells undergo differentiation into lin<sup>+</sup>CD34<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells, that highly express OLFM4. Since siRNAs are transferred to cells following cellular division and the duration of RNA silencing in rapidly dividing cells approaches 1 week (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">McIntosh et al. 2014</xref>), siOLFM4 knockdown most likely reduces OLFM4 production in primitive sCD34<sup>+</sup> cells as well as in CD34<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells differentiated from sCD34<sup>+</sup> cells. Thus, OLFM4 secreted by differentiated cells (neoplastic and non-neoplastic) may provide survival cues to primitive CML cells.</p><p id="P18">The ability to engraft in immunocompromised mice is used as important criterion to identify LSC function. However, hematopoietic cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells have markedly impaired engraftment capacity (<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Slukvin, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">Vo and Daley, 2015</xref>). Although previous mouse studies have found that forced retroviral expression of BCR-ABL in hematopoietic progenitors generated from pluripotent embryonic stem cells endowed them with engraftment potential (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Perlingeiro et al., 2001</xref>), we failed to detect meaningful engraftment following transplantation of CML iPSC-derived iCD34<sup>+</sup> cells (not shown). This could be related to a more &#x0201c;physiological&#x0201d; level of BCR-ABL expression in <italic>de novo</italic> generated human primitive leukemia cells that could be insufficient to enable their engraftment. Therefore, to assess the role of OLFM4 in vivo, we performed transplantation of somatic lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup> cells from CML patients in chronic phase using NOD,B6.SCID IL2R&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> KitW41/W41 (NBSGW mice possessing a defective Kit allele; c-kit, W<sup>41</sup>) (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">McIntosh et al., 2014</xref>).

Using NBSGW mice we were able to detect human CD45<sup>+</sup> cells in bone marrow following transplantation as low as 10,000 lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup> cells from patients in chronic phase of CML. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a and b</xref>, most of the NBSGW mice transplanted with scrambled siRNA-transfected CML sCD34<sup>+</sup> cells demonstrated the presence of human CD45<sup>+</sup> cells in bone marrow. In contrast, only two out eight mice transplanted with siOLFM4-transfected sCD34<sup>+</sup> cells showed detectable human CD45<sup>+</sup> cells at much lower levels compared to corresponding mice in scrambled siRNA group. RT-PCR analysis confirmed that engrafted human CD45<sup>+</sup> cells expressed BCR-ABL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref>). Thus, these studies provide the evidence that OLFM4 is important for the engraftment of primitive leukemia cells in vivo, although it has yet to be determined whether OLFM4 knockdown affects bone marrow homing or in vivo survival of CML lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup> cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S7"><title>3.

Although the potential use of iPSC technology in studying neoplasia has been suggested (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Ramos-Mejia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Slukvin, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">Ye et al., 2009</xref>), only a few groups have reported the generation of iPSCs from malignant cells. The first successful reprogramming of cancer cells was achieved by Hochedlinger, who generated mouse pluripotent stem cells by transplanting nuclei from melanoma into oocytes (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Hochedlinger et al., 2004</xref>). After the discovery of pluripotency factors capable of reprogramming blood cells, iPSC lines have been generated from a patient with a myeloproliferative disorder bearing the JAK2-V617F mutation (<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">Ye et al., 2009</xref>), CML cell lines (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Carette et al., 2010</xref>), primary bone marrow cells of chronic phase CML patients (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Bedel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Kumano et al., 2012</xref>), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Gandre-Babbe et al., 2013</xref>), and mouse MLL-AF9 leukemia cells (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). These studies demonstrated that iPSCs generated from neo-plastic cells carry a disease-specific genetic mutation and can be used to generate blood cells affected by that particular mutation. Here, we advanced the iPSC model to study primitive leukemia cells and proved the utility of this model for discovering drug targets by identifying the novel CML LSC survival factor OLFM4.</p><p id="P20">The iPSC technology offers several major benefits for studying CML. Current protocols for obtaining primitive CML cells are based on selection of lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup> cells from patient bone marrow samples. However, this approach does not reliably isolate LSCs because normal primitive hematopoietic cells usually outnumber BCR-ABL<sup>+</sup> cells within the lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> compartment by several folds (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Petzer et al., 1996</xref>). The capacity of iPSCs to capture CML genetic aberrations, self-renew indefinitely and differentiate into blood cells allows for the production of pure populations of patient-specific BCR-ABL<sup>+</sup> LSC-like cells in unlimited numbers for functional studies and drug screening. As shown in present studies, the use of pure population of induced lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup>CD90<sup>+</sup>CD117<sup>+-</sup>CD45<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> BCR-ABL<sup>+</sup> cells enabled identification of genes affected by imatinib treatment and eventually led to discovery of novel survival factor for primitive leukemia cells OLFM4. iPSCs can be genetically modified to generate CML iPSC lines in which specific gene expression can be conditionally manipulated, thereby facilitating the identification of genes regulating human LSCs&#x02019; survival and expansion. iPSCs obtained from the patients before and after acquisition of drug resistance or progression to blast crisis would be a valuable tool for studying the molecular mechanisms of CML progression and drug resistance. Understanding the impact that clonal evolution and diversity has on CML progression requires the selection and expansion of individual leukemia clones; and this represents the major technical challenge. Because iPSCs are of a single cell origin, multiple iPSC lines can be generated from the same patient to capture the diversity of genetic alterations within leukemia cell populations and address the role of non-BCR-ABL-associated mutations in disease development.</p><p id="P21">Another important finding of this study is the discovery of <italic>OLFM4</italic> as a novel survival factor for primitive CML cells. The human <italic>OLFM4</italic> (also called <italic>GW112</italic> and <italic>hGC-1</italic>) gene encodes a glycoprotein with a multimer structure (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2006</xref>). Transcription for this gene produces four spliced variants and one unspliced OLFM4a&#x02013;OLFM4e mRNA isoforms encoding secreted and cytoplasmic proteins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/Research/Acembly/av.cgi?db=human&#x00026;c=Gene&#x00026;l=OLFM4">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/Research/Acembly/av.cgi?db=human&#x00026;c=Gene&#x00026;l=OLFM4</ext-link>). OLFM4 plays an important role in a variety of cellular functions including cell adhesion, cell cycle and apoptosis (<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Tomarev and Nakaya, 2009</xref>). In the human intestine, OLFM4 was identified as a robust marker of LGR5<sup>+</sup> stem cells and a subset of cancer cells (<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">van der Flier et al., 2009</xref>). OLFM4 is involved in cell growth and apoptosis in human malignancies (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Oh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>) and is considered to be an inducible resistance factor to apoptotic stimuli (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Koshida et al., 2007</xref>). OLFM4 interacts with GRIM-19 (<xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>), which is a component of the respiratory complex I of mitochondria with an anti-apoptotic role in prostate cancer cells (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2004</xref>). However, the effects of OLFM4 on apoptosis appear to be a cell-type dependent. In contrast to prostate cancer cells, overexpression of OLFM4 in HL-60 leukemia cells induces their differentiation and apoptosis (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). Although OLFM4 was initially identified in myeloblasts and later in neutrophils (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Clemmensen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>), OLFM4's biological function in normal and neoplastic hematopoiesis remains largely unknown. It has been shown that OLFM4 expression is upregulated in a subset of patients with acute myeloid leukemia and primary myelo-fibrosis (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Hasselbalch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we demonstrated the expression of OLFM4 protein in lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup> and CD34<sup>&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow cells from CML patients in chronic phase and revealed the distinct pattern of OLFM4 isoform expression in these cells at the mRNA level. CML lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup> cells expressed predominantly cytoplasmic OLFM4 mRNAs. In contrast, CML CD34<sup>&#x02212;</sup> differentiated cells displayed the broad spectrum of cytoplasmic and secreted OLFM4a&#x02013;OLFM4d isoforms. Using OLFM4 knockdown studies, we discovered the critical role OLFM4 in the survival and drug resistance of primitive CML cells and demonstrated differences in OLFM4-mediated regulation of cell survival in CFCs and more primitive LTC-ICs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7d</xref>). While OLFM4 had a minimal role in CML CFC maintenance in normal conditions, it was required for protection of CML CFCs from imatinib-mediated inhibition. In contrast, maintenance of CML LTC-ICs was dependent on OLFM4 and independent of BCRABL kinase activity. Consistent with in vitro LTC-IC studies, OLFM4 knockdown also abrogated the engraftment of BCR-ABL<sup>+</sup> cells in NBSGW mice, thereby providing another critical evidence for the essential role of OLFM4 in homeostasis of CML cells in vivo. The mechanisms responsible for the distinct role of OLFM4 in the survival of leukemia cells at different stages of maturation remain to be investigated. It is possible that cell-context specific effects may be related to differences in the expression and/or regulation of the OLFM4 isoforms in a stage-specific fashion. It is also important to investigate whether OLFM4 mediates cell survival in a self-autonomous or non-autonomous manner. Given that lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup> cells acquire a CD34<sup>&#x02212;</sup> differentiated phenotype which is associated with a high level of OLFM4 expression in culture, it is possible that secretion of OLFM4 by differentiated cells generates a milieu supportive for the growth of undifferentiated CML cells in vitro. Similarly, we observed that differentiated CD34<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells next to CD34<sup>+</sup> cells in bone marrow biopsy samples of CML patients express high levels of OLFM4. In addition, OLFM4 is produced by normal non-leukemic CD34<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells. Thereby, OLFM4 secreted by differentiated leukemic or nonleukemic cells may confer a selective growth advantage to the more primitive CML cells and LSCs in vivo.</p><p id="P22">Overall, our studies indicate that OLFM4-mediated signaling supports the survival of primitive leukemia cells. Thus, analysis of OLFM4 and its isoforms in peripheral blood could be exploited as predictive markers for treatment regimens, while targeting OLFM4 or OLFM4-mediated signaling could be explored as an option to eradicate primitive CML cells. Potentially, OLFM4 could be targeted using anti-OLFM4 antibodies. An antibody approach has already been described to modulate the activity of another protein within the OLFM family, OLFM3. As shown by Miljkovic-Licina (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Miljkovic-Licina et al., 2012</xref>), administration of anti-OLFM3 antibodies efficiently blocked proangiogenic signaling mediated by this protein in vivo. Finally, our studies provide a strong background and novel model for the further exploration of the mechanisms of OLFM4 action in primitive CML cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S8"><title>4.
