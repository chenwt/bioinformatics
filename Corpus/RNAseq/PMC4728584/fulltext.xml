Cricket paralysis virus (CrPV), a member of <italic>Dicistroviridae</italic>, has a positive-sense single strand RNA genome that contains two internal ribosome entry sites (IRES), a 5&#x02032;untranslated region (5&#x02032;UTR) and intergenic region (IGR) IRES, that direct translation of open reading frames (ORF) encoding the viral non-structural and structural proteins, respectively. The regulation of and the significance of the CrPV IRESs during infection are not fully understood. In this study, using a series of biochemical assays including radioactive-pulse labelling, reporter RNA assays and ribosome profiling, we demonstrate that while 5&#x02032;UTR IRES translational activity is constant throughout infection, IGR IRES translation is delayed and then stimulated two to three hours post infection. The delay in IGR IRES translation is not affected by inhibiting global translation prematurely via treatment with Pateamine A. Using a CrPV replicon that uncouples viral translation and replication, we show that the increase in IGR IRES translation is dependent on expression of non-structural proteins and is greatly stimulated when replication is active. Temporal regulation by distinct IRESs within the CrPV genome is an effective viral strategy to ensure optimal timing and expression of viral proteins to facilitate infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>virus</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>IRES</kwd><kwd>ribosome</kwd><kwd>dicistrovirus</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-viruses-08-00025"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Viral protein synthesis is an essential process in all viral life cycles. As such, viruses have adapted diverse strategies to recruit the host ribosome and the translational machinery. Numerous positive strand RNA viruses use a strategy whereby infection leads to an inhibition of host translation concomitant with an increase in viral protein synthesis [<xref rid="B1-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. One of the best-studied examples of this switch from host to viral protein synthesis is during poliovirus infection: the translation factors eIF4G and poly A binding protein are cleaved by virally-encoded proteases thereby shutting off cap-dependent translation [<xref rid="B2-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. By contrast, the poliovirus internal ribosome entry site, IRES, recruits the ribosome using a subset of translation factors and IRES trans-acting factors (ITAFs) to direct cap-independent viral protein synthesis [<xref rid="B5-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, the strategies that underlie the switch from host to viral protein synthesis such as the signalling pathways that target translation factors and the mechanisms that direct viral protein expression are fundamental to virus infection.</p><p>The <italic>Dicistroviridae</italic> family uses an interesting strategy for viral protein synthesis: the monopartite plus strand ~9 kb RNA genome contains two IRESs, the 5&#x02032;untranslated region (5&#x02032;UTR) and the intergenic (IGR) IRES that direct translation of two open reading frames (ORFs) encoding the non-structural and structural proteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f001">Figure 1</xref>A) [<xref rid="B6-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Infection of Drosophila S2 cells by the dicistrovirus <italic>Cricket paralysis virus</italic> (CrPV) results in the rapid shut off of host protein synthesis concomitant with preferential viral protein synthesis involving supramolar expression of the structural proteins compared to the non-structural proteins [<xref rid="B7-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].

The IGR IRES has been studied extensively [<xref rid="B14-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; the IGR IRES directly recruits the ribosome without the aid of translation initiation factors and initiates translation from a non-AUG codon [<xref rid="B14-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Biochemical and structural studies have revealed that the IGR IRES adopts distinct structural domains that enable the IRES to occupy the intersubunit core of the ribosome in order to gain access to the ribosomal A and P sites [<xref rid="B15-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B20-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Indeed, the CrPV pseudoknot I domain of the IGR IRES structurally mimics the anticodon of a tRNA [<xref rid="B15-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Recent cryo-EM studies have demonstrated that the PKI domain first occupies the A site followed by translocation to the P site and thereby leaving the A site unoccupied for delivery of the initial aminoacyl-tRNA [<xref rid="B22-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. By contrast, studies on the mechanism of the 5&#x02032;UTR IRES have been limited [<xref rid="B13-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B24-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]; using a reconstitution approach, Terenin <italic>et al.</italic> (2005) showed that eIF1, eIF2, and eIF3 are required for 5&#x02032;UTR IRES dependent translation of a related dicistrovirus <italic>Rhapdopsilum padi virus</italic> (RhPV) [<xref rid="B24-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Differences in the mechanism of the CrPV 5&#x02032;UTR and IGR IRESs likely contribute to distinct expression levels of non-structural and structural proteins. Supporting this, 5&#x02032;UTR IRES translation is weaker than IGR IRES translation [<xref rid="B9-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and that IGR IRES translation is stimulated during CrPV infection using transfection approaches of reporter RNAs [<xref rid="B25-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, the significance of this strategy by dicistroviruses is not well understood. Many RNA viruses control the timing of viral protein expression in order to facilitate viral replication early in infection and viral packaging later in infection [<xref rid="B26-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. For example, in <italic>Alphavirus</italic> infections, non-structural proteins are expressed prior to structural protein synthesis in order to coordinate replication and viral assembly temporally [<xref rid="B26-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>In this study, using a series of approaches including radioactive pulse-labelling, reporter construct assays and ribosome profiling, we demonstrate that the 5&#x02032;UTR and IGR IRES activities are temporally regulated during CrPV infection. Specifically, IGR IRES translation is delayed until later times in infection when compared to 5&#x02032;UTR IRES translation. The delay is not due to a general decrease in host translation, an increase in eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation during infection or a decrease in host transcription. Using a novel CrPV replicon that uncouples the effects of replication and translation, our data suggest that non-structural viral proteins may be partly responsible for the increase in IGR IRES dependent translation during infection. In summary, CrPV uses an IRES-dependent temporal regulation strategy in order to ensure optimal expression of structural and non-structural proteins and to facilitate the timing of events during the viral life cycle.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-08-00025"><title>2.

For the CrPV2(Fluc), CrPV2(Fluc)-ORF1<sup>stop</sup>, and CrPV2(Fluc)-mutRdRp replicons, standard recombinant DNA technology was used to construct these plasmids. Unique restriction sites that facilitated insertion of the firefly luciferase gene into the CrPV-2 clone [<xref rid="B27-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. Specifically, an XhoI site was introduced by substituting two nucleotides within ORF2 that encodes VP2 and a SacII site was introduced by adding the restriction sequence, 5&#x02032;-CCGCGG-3&#x02032;, after ORF2 in CrPV2. The primer pairs used for introducing XhoI are 5&#x02032;-ATGAAGATAAAAGACTCGAGTCAGAACAGAAAGAAATTGTACATT-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-CTCGAGTCTTTTATCTTCATAAACAAGAAAATTCACACATTGAAA-3&#x02032; and the primer pairs used for introducing SacI are 5&#x02032;-TAGCACGCGCCTAACCGCGGCTAACTATTTGCTTTGTATTTTAAG-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-CCGCGGTTAGGCGCGTGCTACATTTACTAAAGGTGGAACTCCAAG-3&#x02032;.

The CrPV-2 plasmid containing XhoI and SacII and the amplified firefly luciferase gene were digested with XhoI and SacII restriction enzymes. The backbone of the CrPV-2 plasmid was then gel purified (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Subsequently, the PCR-purified (Qiagen) digested firefly luciferase gene was combined in a ligation reaction with the CrPV-2 backbone template as described in the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). After transforming the ligation reaction, DH5&#x003b1; bacteria colonies were picked and insertion of the firefly luciferase gene into the CrPV-2 clone was sequenced verified.

Using an RdRp antibody for Western blot analysis, we detected unprocessed RdRp non-structural proteins at 120 (RdRp*), 105 (RdRp**), and 100 kDA (RdRp***) and the mature 3D at 60 kDa. A close inspection of the pulse-labelled proteins showed that the non-structural proteins such as the unprocessed 120 kDa RdRp and 2C are detected first at two h.p.i. whereas the structural proteins are not detected until after three h.p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f001">Figure 1</xref>B), which is similar to that observed previously [<xref rid="B7-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B9-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Quantitation of the viral proteins confirmed that the non-structural proteins are first expressed by two h.p.i. and increase steadily at later times of infection and that the viral structural proteins are not detected until three to four h.p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). We note that quantitation of the pulse-labelled non-structural proteins at two h.p.i. may be masked due to ongoing host protein synthesis at this time of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). To detect the non-structural proteins more accurately, we monitored synthesis by immunoprecipitation of pulse-labelled structural and non-structural proteins from CrPV-infected cell lysates (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-08-00025">Figure S1</xref>). Specifically, we pulse-labelled cells for one hour followed by lysis and immunoprecipitation using &#x003b1;-RdRP and &#x003b1;-VP2 antibodies. We initially optimized the immunoprecipitation conditions to ensure that the antibody is saturating by incubating increasing amounts of [<sup>35</sup>S]-Met/Cys labelled lysates with a constant amount of antibody (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-08-00025">Figure S1</xref>A,B). Immunoprecipitation with the &#x003b1;-RdRp antibody pulled down unprocessed and mature RdRp from infected lysates whereas the &#x003b1;-VP2 immunoprecipitated all four structural proteins, likely as a packaged virion (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-08-00025">Figure S1</xref>A,B).

(1) The increase in structural protein synthesis can be described by some form of passive regulation during infection&#x02014;a combination of ribosome availability upon host translational repression, different intrinsic affinities for ribosomes and requirements for translation initiation factors between the 5&#x02032;IRES and the IGR IRES and/or an increase in viral RNAs; (2) alternatively, the increase in viral structural protein synthesis may be driven by some active form of regulation during infection; in other words, IGR IRES translation may be activated or inhibited, possibly by protein factors binding to the IGR IRES and/or by changes in the structure of IGR IRES during infection. To address these two broad hypotheses, we examined IRES activities indirectly by ribosome profiling. Ribosome profiling is a next-generation sequencing-based approach that identifies ribosome occupancy across mRNAs at high nucleotide resolution [<xref rid="B33-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. RNAseq analysis, which is performed in parallel, takes into account for mRNA abundance, thus the translational efficiency of each mRNA can be calculated. We measured ribosome occupancy on the CrPV RNA at 2, 4 and 6 h.p.i (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). Ribosome protected fragments (RPF) were found predominantly within the two main ORFs, and as expected very little RPFs were found within the IGR and 3&#x02032;UTR. To determine the TE of each ORF, we divided the number of ribosome-protected footprints (RPFs) for each ORF to the average read frequency across the viral RNA genome. At two h.p.i, the translational efficiencies of ORF1 and ORF2 are approximately equal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f002">Figure 2</xref>B), which suggests that both ORFs are translated similarly. While the translational efficiency of ORF1 remains relatively constant as infection progresses, the translational efficiency of ORF2 increases by approximately 2.5 fold over the course of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). These results suggest that the increased ribosome occupancy on ORF2 is a reflection of increased translation by the IGR IRES at later times of infection.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-viruses-08-00025"><title>3.3. IRES Translation Using CrPV Minigenome Reporter Analysis</title><p>The ribosome profiling and pulse-labelling experimental results suggest that translation of the CrPV ORFs is regulated. However, it is possible that the increase in ORF2 expression at 3&#x02013;4 h.p.i. may be reflected in the rapid increase in viral RNA levels due to replication [<xref rid="B7-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. To uncouple the effects of viral translation from replication, we directly examined 5&#x02032;UTR and IGR IRES translation using a CrPV reporter minigenome construct whereby the viral ORF1 and ORF2 are replaced with Renilla and firefly luciferase gene, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f003">Figure 3</xref>A) [<xref rid="B27-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

Previously, we showed that this approach resulted in luciferase activity that increases linearly in the first six hours, indicating that the reporter RNA is engaged in translation during this time [<xref rid="B25-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Cells were harvested at 1&#x02013;5 h after infection and assayed for luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f003">Figure 3</xref>B,C). As expected, in mock-infected cells transfected with the minigenome RNA, Renilla luciferase activity increased over time in the first five hours after transfection. In CrPV-infected cells, Renilla luciferase activity increased over time at a similar rate as in mock-infected cells, suggesting that 5&#x02032;UTR IRES translation is relatively constant during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). In contrast, firefly luciferase activity accumulated gradually early in infection and sharply increased after two h.p.i., suggesting that IGR IRES translation is delayed at early times of infection and is stimulated at later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f003">Figure 3</xref>C).

Role of Transcriptional Shutoff in Viral Protein Synthesis under CrPV Infection</title><p>A number of viruses inhibit transcription and/or translation during infection. We hypothesize that these widespread disruptions in cellular homeostasis may have an effect on IGR IRES translation. To examine this, we first tested if cellular transcription is affected during CrPV infection, which may be responsible for changes in IGR IRES-dependent translation. Several studies have examined the changes in transcriptomes during dicistrovirus infection in Drosophila S2 cells and in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> [<xref rid="B36-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In general, dicistroviruses repress the transcription of host genes [<xref rid="B39-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We verified that CrPV infection repressed cellular transcription by pulse labelling mock and CrPV-infected S2 cells with [<sup>3</sup>H]-uridine for 15 min at specific time points after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). RNA was extracted, resolved on an agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane. Methylene blue staining readily detected the 18S/28S rRNA, which migrated at a size of ~2 kb, confirming that the RNA is intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). In Drosophila, the mature 28S rRNA undergoes cleavage producing two products of approximate size to each other that coincides with the size of the 18S rRNA [<xref rid="B40-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Labeling with [<sup>3</sup>H]-uridine in mock-infected cells produced two predominant radiolabelled bands that migrated at ~8 kb and ~5 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). Because we only labelled with [<sup>3</sup>H]-uridine for a short period, these labelled RNAs likely represent immature, unprocessed rRNA precursors. As expected, treatment of mock-infected cells with actinomycin D completely inhibited host transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). CrPV infection at an MOI of 10 resulted in labeling of a ~9 kb RNA, which increased during the course of infection demonstrating viral replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). To distinguish between host and viral transcription, host transcription was inhibited by treating cells with actinomycin D (5 &#x000b5;g/mL) prior to [<sup>3</sup>H]-uridine-labeling. As predicted, radiolabelled viral RNA was only detected in actinomycin D-treated infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f004">Figure 4</xref>A,C). Viral RNA synthesis increased during the first 4 h of infection before levelling off and correlated with the increase in viral RNA as measured by Northern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f004">Figure 4</xref>D). In contrast, host transcription was rapidly inhibited within one hour of infection (~80% inhibition) and remained shut off during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f004">Figure 4</xref>A,C). Host transcription was calculated by subtracting the amount of [<sup>3</sup>H]-uridine labelled RNA in cells treated with actinomycin D from that in cells without actinomycin D. The quantitations of both viral and host transcription is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f004">Figure 4</xref>C.

If shutoff of transcription is necessary for the enhanced structural protein synthesis at three h.p.i, IGR IRES translation may be prematurely stimulated. No significant changes in viral non-structural and structural protein synthesis were observed between cells pretreated with actinomycin D, suggesting that host transcriptional shutoff does not contribute significantly to the temporal regulation of viral ORF protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f004">Figure 4</xref>F,G).</p><fig id="viruses-08-00025-f004" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mock- and CrPV-infected S2 cells were pulse-labelled with [<sup>3</sup>H]-uridine for ten minutes at the indicated hours post infection (h.p.i.) before harvesting.

CrPV infection leads to a significant shutoff of translation at two to three h.p.i. which is the approximate time when IGR IRES translation is stimulated [<xref rid="B7-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. We previously showed that eIF2&#x003b1; is phosphorylated approximately at this time post infection, however, forced dephosphorylation of eIF2&#x003b1; did not impact host translational shut off or viral protein synthesis [<xref rid="B7-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].

To this end, we inhibited eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation by treating S2 cells with double stranded RNAs, dsRNAs, directed against the two known eIF2&#x003b1; kinases in Drosophila, dPERK and dGCN2. Since both dPERK and dGCN2 are required for eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation in arsenite-treated S2 cells, dsRNA knockdown efficiencies were assessed indirectly by immunoblotting for eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation in arsenite-treated dPERK and dGCN2-depleted S2 cells [<xref rid="B44-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Treating cells with both dPERK and dGCN2 dsRNAs but not singly inhibited arsenite-induced eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation, which is similar to that observed previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f005">Figure 5</xref>A) [<xref rid="B44-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], thus validating our knockdown conditions. We next determined which kinase is responsible for eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation in CrPV-infected S2 cells. We incubated GFP dsRNAs as a control or dPERK or dGCN2 dsRNAs individually or together to S2 cells prior to mock- or CrPV-infection. While CrPV-infected S2 cells treated with control (GFP), GCN2 or PERK dsRNAs resulted in phosphorylation of eIF2&#x003b1;, treating infected cells with both PERK and GCN2 dsRNAs abolished eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). Thus, our result suggests that both GCN2 and PERK are activated in CrPV-infected S2 cells to induce eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation. To determine whether host or viral protein synthesis is perturbed, we monitored protein synthesis by pulse-labelling in CrPV-infected S2 cells treated with control dsRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f005">Figure 5</xref>B) or with PERK and GCN2 dsRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f005">Figure 5</xref>C).

Thus, in agreement with previous findings [<xref rid="B7-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation is not responsible for host translation shutoff or viral protein synthesis and does not appear to contribute to the temporal regulation of IGR IRES-mediated translation of CrPV ORF2 in CrPV-infected S2 cells.</p><fig id="viruses-08-00025-f005" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Role of dPERK and dGCN2 eIF2&#x003b1; kinases in CrPV-infected S2 cells.

Premature Translational Shutoff and CrPV IRES Translation</title><p>We next asked whether prematurely repressing host translation can alter the temporal regulation of ORF1 and ORF2 expression in CrPV infected cells. We reasoned that premature inhibition of host translation may stimulate IGR IRES translation earlier in infected cells. Treatment of mammalian cells with the chemical compound, Pateamine A (PatA), which deregulates eIF4A activity, results in a rapid decrease in cap-dependent translation and stimulates IGR IRES-mediated translation [<xref rid="B25-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B45-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. We treated mock- or CrPV-infected S2 cells with PatA at one h.p.i. and monitored protein synthesis by pulse-labeling. As expected, PatA inhibited overall host protein synthesis after only one hour of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f006">Figure 6</xref>B, compare lane 1 to 3). The effects of PatA continued to abolish translation after 5 h of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f006">Figure 6</xref>B, lanes 5, 7, 9 and 11). Compared to DMSO- treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f006">Figure 6</xref>A), PatA treatment of CrPV-infected cells resulted in a premature significant shut off of host protein synthesis by 2 h.p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f006">Figure 6</xref>B, lane 3). In contrast and interestingly, only the CrPV non-structural proteins could be visibly detected at this time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f006">Figure 6</xref>B, lane 4) and it is not until 3 h.p.i. that synthesis of the structural proteins is detected, which is similar to the time that is observed in DMSO-treated infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f006">Figure 6</xref>A,B).

Finally, PatA treatment did not significantly affect intracellular CrPV yield, thus suggesting that premature translational shut off in S2 cells does not affect viral replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f006">Figure 6</xref>C). To ensure these results are not specific to PatA, we prematurely inhibited cellular translation with DTT, a treatment that induces eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation and also known to stimulate IGR IRES translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f006">Figure 6</xref>D,E).

Non-Structural Viral Proteins Promote Expression of Structural Viral Proteins</title><p>Because IGR IRES-mediated translation is not perturbed by premature inhibition of cellular translation or transcription, we next asked if one or more non-structural viral proteins may be responsible for the regulation of IGR IRES activity. To test this, we created a CrPV replicon (CrPV2(Fluc)) by replacing the ORF2 structural proteins of the CrPV-2 infectious clone with firefly luciferase [<xref rid="B27-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Thus, firefly luciferase expression in this replicon is under the control of the IGR IRES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f007">Figure 7</xref>A). To address whether expression of the non-structural proteins affects IGR IRES translation, we generated another replicon (CrPV2(Fluc)-ORF1<sup>stop</sup>), which contains two stop codons within the most N-terminal protein of ORF1, CrPV1A, and thus prevents ORF1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f007">Figure 7</xref>A). The <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed replicons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f007">Figure 7</xref>B) were transfected into S2 cells and luciferase activity was measured at different time points after transfection (hours post transfection (h.p.t)).

Discussion</title><p>Dicistroviruses utilize a strategy whereby distinct IRESs regulate translation of non-structural and structural protein ORFs. While it has been well established that the viral structural proteins are produced in supramolar excess over non-structural viral proteins [<xref rid="B7-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], the significance and the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not been investigated in detail. Here, we demonstrate that translation of the two ORFs via the 5&#x02032;UTR and IGR IRESs are temporally regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f008">Figure 8</xref>). Using a series of biochemical and molecular assays, we show conclusively that there is a reproducible delay, albeit slight, in IGR IRES translation compared to 5&#x02032;UTR IRES translation during CrPV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f003">Figure 3</xref>). We also showed that this temporal regulation is not dependent on the repression of host transcriptional or translational inhibition, cellular processes that are perturbed during CrPV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f004">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Using CrPV(Fluc) replicons to decouple viral translation from viral replication, we showed that the increase in IGR IRES translation is partly dependent on viral non-structural proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f007">Figure 7</xref>). We propose that CrPV utilizes a dual IRES translational control strategy to ensure that optimal expression of viral non-structural proteins occurs prior to synthesis of viral structural proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f008">Figure 8</xref>), and as a result, this leads to the temporal regulation of viral replication and virus assembly during infection.</p><p>Regulation of IRES translation is key for some virus infections. For instance, poliovirus uses a strategy via temporal cleavage of host factors such as the translation factors eIF4G and poly (A) binding protein and IRES-trans-acting factors, Poly(rC) binding protein 2 and polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1, to regulate the switch from host translation to IRES-mediated protein synthesis as well as the switch from viral translation to replication [<xref rid="B3-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B47-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In this study, we examined whether the distinct temporal regulation of non-structural and structural protein synthesis during CrPV infection may be driven by the shutoff of host translation and the different factor requirements between IGR IRES and 5&#x02032;UTR dependent translation [<xref rid="B13-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B24-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Surprisingly, attempts to disrupt overall host translation by either inhibiting eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation or affecting eIF4A activity during infection did not affect the timing of 5&#x02032;UTR and IGR IRES translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Although it has been shown that CrPV IGR IRES translation is stimulated when eIF2&#x003b1; is phosphorylated or eIF4A activity is disrupted [<xref rid="B14-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B25-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B42-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], it is clear that indirect effects through translational shutoff are not a prerequisite for IGR IRES stimulation during CrPV infection.</p><p>One possible explanation is that there may be a more direct effect on IGR IRES translation during infection: (i) IGR IRES translation may be inhibited at early time points during infection or (ii) IGR IRES translation may be activated at later times. Our data suggest that besides RdRp, one or more non-structural proteins contribute to the increased structural protein synthesis during CrPV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f007">Figure 7</xref>). Specifically, a reproducible two-fold increase in luciferase activity was noted when comparing a mutant replicon that is defective in replicating (CrPV2(Fluc)-mutRdRp) to a mutant replicon that expresses no non-structural viral proteins (CrPV2(Fluc)-ORF1<sup>stop</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f007">Figure 7</xref>). These results suggest that non-structural proteins may act directly or indirectly to regulate IGR IRES translation during CrPV infection, potentially via structural conformations of the IGR IRES and/or affecting ribosome recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f007">Figure 7</xref>). A possible target is the ribosome. It has been shown that depletion of a subset of ribosomal proteins results in inhibition of IRES-dependent but not cap-dependent translation [<xref rid="B29-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B50-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], suggesting that heterogeneity of ribosomes may have an effect on IRES translation. For example, depletion of a subset of ribosomal proteins inhibits IGR IRES translation and infectivity by a related dicistrovirus Drosophila C virus [<xref rid="B29-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B50-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Interestingly, cells depleted of RACK1, a component of the 40S subunit, leads to inhibition of 5&#x02032;UTR IRES but not IGR IRES translation during infection, thus further supporting that the two CrPV IRESs are differentially regulated at the ribosome level [<xref rid="B53-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Thus, it remains to be examined whether specific post-translational modifications or depletion of key ribosomal proteins during CrPV infection may contribute to the temporal regulation of IRES translation.</p><fig id="viruses-08-00025-f008" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Model of CrPV 5&#x02032;UTR IRES and IGR IRES-dependent translation during infection.

It is possible that a similar phenomena is occurring under CrPV infection. However, there have yet to be any reports of host (or viral) factors other than the ribosome that bind to the IGR IRES. Moreover, given the compact structure of the IRES, it is difficult to imagine a trans-acting factor binding to the IGR IRES [<xref rid="B16-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B20-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

In contrast, despite the significant increase in viral RNA during CrPV infection, 5&#x02032;UTR IRES-mediated translation is not stimulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00025-f001">Figure 1</xref>), thus underscoring the differential regulation of the distinct IRESs during CrPV infection.

Alternatively, IGR IRES translation may be stimulated even more within viral progeny genomes. It has been reported that newly transcribed vaccinia RNAs during infection are preferentially translated during infection [<xref rid="B56-viruses-08-00025" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].
