Functional genomics studies aimed at probing the mechanisms that regulate development require high-quality genomes and transcript annotations. The quality of these resources has improved dramatically over the last several years, but many isoforms and genes have yet to be identified. We hope to contribute to the process of improving these resources with the data presented here: a set of long cDNA sequencing reads, and a curated set of new genes and transcript isoforms not currently represented in the most up-to-date genome annotation currently available to the community of researchers who rely on the chicken genome.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by the Bench to Bassinet Program (B2B) award number U01-HL098188.

In addition to the sequence of bases that constitute a genome, the locations and boundaries of genes and their exons must also be identified. Furthermore, many genes exhibit alternate splicing such that a few exons may exhibit a large degree of combinatorial possibilities. These transcript isoforms must also be detected in order to have a thorough set of genome resources. This annotation process typically requires a combination of computational and experimental approaches. All of the important work being done now to uncover the regulatory mechanisms that control when and how genes are active rely heavily on a foundation built with solid genome assemblies and annotations. Humans and several key model organisms have quite good genome assemblies <xref rid="pone.0094650-Lander1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094650-C1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> with other associated resources including high quality annotations for transcript isoforms and even the locations of functional regulatory elements in various cell and tissue types <xref rid="pone.0094650-ENCODE1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094650-Gerstein1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Resources for other model organisms are also being developed. The UCSC genome browser <xref rid="pone.0094650-Kent1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> currently contains assemblies and annotations for dozens of eukaryotic organisms. These resources are in various states of accuracy and completeness. In the case of the genome for <italic>Gallus gallus</italic>, the common chicken, the genome was initially published in 2004 <xref rid="pone.0094650-International1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and has been periodically updated since, with the latest being the &#x02018;galGal4&#x02019; assembly published in late 2011. The most up-to-date transcript annotations for these assemblies come from RefSeq <xref rid="pone.0094650-Pruitt1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and Ensembl <xref rid="pone.0094650-Curwen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094650-Potter1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The RefSeq annotations are well-founded but only contain a fraction of the total number of genes and isoforms. The Ensembl annotation is much more thorough but is not yet complete as it does not contain annotations for regions seen to be transcribed in previously-published data <xref rid="pone.0094650-Brawand1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The current annotations also contain fewer genes and isoforms than those of the more complete human and mouse genomes <xref rid="pone.0094650-Lander1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094650-Venter1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094650-Chinwalla2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, though it is possible that there are systematic differences in the number of alternate isoforms seen in avian and mammalian genomes.</p><p>The chicken has been used as a model for embryogenesis for thousands of years <xref rid="pone.0094650-Burt1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and notable scientists such as Aristotle, Harvey, Pasteur and Darwin used chickens as models for embryology, circulation, infection and evolution. The chicken continues to be an extremely useful model organism in many areas including aiding our understand of the molecular mechanisms behind heart development <xref rid="pone.0094650-Bao1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>For these reasons a collaboration was created between the Cardiovascular Development Consortium of the Bench to Bassinet Program and Pacific Biosciences to help improve the chicken genome annotation. By generating new long-read sequences and incorporating existing short-read and EST sequences, we identified thousands of transcript isoforms as well as hundreds of genes not currently included in the Ensembl annotations. It is our expectation that the results presented here will serve as a resource for the community of researchers who rely on the chicken genome, and that our methodology will help others whose goal it is to improve the annotations of other model organism genomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Illumina data</title><p>The following Gallus gallus RNAseq datasets made from the respective brains, cerebellums, hearts, livers, kidneys and testes of adult chickens, were retrieved from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive <xref rid="pone.0094650-Brawand1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>: SRX081869, SRX081870, SRX081871, SRX081872, SRX081873, SRX081874, SRX081875, SRX081876, SRX081877, SRX081878, SRX081879, SRX081880.

First, each exon junction was checked for proper splice acceptor (AG|N) and splice donor sites (N|GT). Second, each junction was checked against the database of exon junctions derived from Illumina short-read sequencing (described above). Multi-exon sequences that contained only validated junctions were retained. A junction code was created for each transcript isoform representing the string of junctions that it contained. The isoform codes were merged together to remove duplicate isoform fragments, and then the furthest transcription start and stop sites were assigned to each isoform code in order to handle the observed variability in exact transcription start and stop sites between isoforms with the exact same exons. Those isoforms with codes that were not present among the galGal4 Ensembl annotations were retained. The codes representing new isoforms were converted back into chromosomal locations, and those isoforms were intersected with Ensembl genic regions to identify those transcript isoforms that represented new gene regions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results, Discussion and Conclusions</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Broad coverage of embryonic heart transcripts by new long-read sequencing data</title><p>After extracting RNA from embryonic chicken hearts and creating cDNA libraries, the libraries were sequenced yielding 1,849,786 cDNA sequencing reads. Of these, 1,566,465 (85%) mapped to the galGal4 genome, showing accurate mapping of these reads (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094650-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The average mapped transcript length was 1,076 bp, compared to an average of &#x0223c;2,400 bp for all Ensembl annotations, when corrected for estimated transcript abundance. This reflects the reality that even with long-read sequences, we were unable to fully sequence the entire lengths of long transcripts. Truncation of transcripts could occur from RNA degradation, mechanical shearing of the sample, incomplete PCR amplification, or loading bias of the sequencer.</p><fig id="pone-0094650-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0094650.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Long-read sequences map accurately to the chicken genome.</title><p>Shown in this UCSC genome browser image is one example of a long-read alignment shown alongside the corresponding short-read data for this region as well as existing RefSeq and Ensembl annotations.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0094650.g001"/></fig><p>To estimate what percentage of the transcriptome these sequences represented, we compared the coverage of these sequences to the per-base coverage of the entire RefSeq annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094650-g002">Figure 2</xref>). RefSeq was used for this analysis because its annotations represented high-confidence genes conserved across numerous animal species. Of all RefSeq genes, 81% had some overlap with the new sequencing data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0094650-t001">Table 1</xref>). That number is on par with the fraction of genes that are expected to be expressed in heart tissues, based on the relative coverage of heart RNAseq datasets compared to all RNAseq datasets from chicken (data not shown). This observation suggests that the long-read sequences represent at least partial coverage of almost all chicken genes that are expressed in embryonic chicken hearts. However, only 42% the annotation set was covered to at least 90% of the read length. An additional sequencing run that added over 100 k sequences did little to improve the coverage, suggesting that we were approaching the saturation point of the libraries' complexities. Future efforts to improve the chicken genome would provide greater coverage and across a broader range of tissue types and developmental stages.</p><fig id="pone-0094650-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0094650.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Broad coverage of existing chicken genes using long-read sequencing.</title><p>Along the x-axis representing transcript length is a histogram of the number of RefSeq transcripts within a given range of lengths (grey).

The similarities in the percentages with which the long and short-read datasets overlap existing annotations suggests good agreement, though they remain incomplete due to lack of RNA sampling and saturation across the many different tissue types. When the long and short-read sequences were compared to each other, there was still quite good agreement, with the long-read sequencing covering more than 60% of the annotations based on short-read data. The short-read data overlapped 52% of the long-read data. Interestingly, the Ensembl annotations covered 99% of the RefSeq annotations, while both sequencing data annotations captured just over 80%, which is possibly due to the relatively limited set of tissues from which the samples were taken.</p><p>The above observations suggest quite good agreement on the level of gene regions. To explore how well the splice donor and acceptor sites agree between the short and long-read datasets and the Ensembl annotations, we identified all splice donor sites present in 1.) junctions identified among the short-read sequences, 2.) junctions identified from the Ensembl annotations and 3.) junctions identified from the long-read sequences. Junctions identified from the short-read data match the locations of annotated splice acceptor and donor sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094650-g003">Figure 3</xref>), and for the most part, the long-read data agrees as well. However, approximately 10% of the long sequence reads mapped beyond the &#x02018;correct&#x02019; donor site to a downstream &#x02018;GT&#x02019; sequence. The origin of this error seemed to be in the process by which the GMAP aligner identifies exon boundaries for sequences with a higher rate of indels. The use of short-read data to validate the splice sites eliminates any effects this mapping error might have on exon boundary identification in the long-read sequences.</p><fig id="pone-0094650-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0094650.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Validation of mapped long-read splice sites.</title><p>TopHat2 was used to identify observed splice junctions from the short-read data.

The lack of overlap with other annotation sets indicates that many genes currently lack any annotations among all of the known datasets.</p><fig id="pone-0094650-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0094650.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Identification of new isoforms and genes.</title><p>Shown in this image from the UCSC genome browser are examples of the new genes and isoforms identified from among the short and long-read annotations: A.

A cluster of these differentially expressed isoforms showed enriched expression in hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094650-g005">Figure 5a</xref>), as was expected given that 20% of the short-read sequences came from adult heart tissue and that all of the long-read sequences came from embryonic heart tissue. In addition, there were three other major clusters of tissue-specific expression. One cluster was enriched in the brain and cerebellum, while the second was enriched in kidneys and liver. The last set of isoforms was enriched in testes. Almost identical clusters were observed among the set of 181 completely new gene regions that were differentially expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094650-g005">Figure 5b</xref>). Given that the samples used were from a limited number of tissue types, it is likely that more extensive exploration of transcript products will yield many more genes and isoforms specific to those tissues.</p><fig id="pone-0094650-g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0094650.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>New isoforms and genes with tissue-specific expression.</title><p>The relative expression of (a) the 2,018 differentially expressed isoforms and (b) the 120 new differentially expressed gene annotations are provided across chicken adult brain, cerebellum, heart, kidney, liver and testes datasets, along the scale provided.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0094650.g005"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Summary</title><p>Using long-read sequences generated from embryonic chicken hearts in combination with short-read sequences from 5 different adult chicken tissues, we were able to contribute over 9,000 new transcript isoforms to the most complete chicken genome annotation, including the identification of more than 500 genic regions without current annotation in Ensembl.
