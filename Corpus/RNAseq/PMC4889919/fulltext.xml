OCT4 (POU5F1) and NANOG are essential for cell stemness and pluripotency; yet, the mechanisms that regulate their expression remain largely unknown. Repetitive elements account for almost half of the Human Genome; still, their role in gene regulation is poorly understood. Here, we show that the dioxin receptor (AHR) leads to differentiation of human carcinoma cells through the transcriptional upregulation of <italic>Alu</italic> retrotransposons, whose RNA transcripts can repress pluripotency genes. Despite the genome-wide presence of <italic>Alu</italic> elements, we provide evidences that those located at the <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4</italic> promoters bind AHR, are transcribed by RNA polymerase-III and repress <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4</italic> in differentiated cells. <italic>OCT4</italic> and <italic>NANOG</italic> repression likely involves processing of <italic>Alu</italic>-derived transcripts through the miRNA machinery involving the Microprocessor and RISC. Consistently, stable AHR knockdown led to basal undifferentiation, impaired <italic>Alus</italic> transcription and blockade of <italic>OCT4</italic> and <italic>NANOG</italic> repression. We suggest that transcripts produced from AHR-regulated <italic>Alu</italic> retrotransposons may control the expression of stemness genes <italic>OCT4</italic> and <italic>NANOG</italic> during differentiation of carcinoma cells. The control of discrete <italic>Alu</italic> elements by specific transcription factors may have a dynamic role in genome regulation under physiological and diseased conditions.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="19"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>02 June 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Recent evidences suggest that active transposable elements (TEs) have an important role in defining Human Genome structure and function and, consequently, in controlling development and disease (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Short interspersed nuclear <italic>Alu</italic> elements (SINE) are a class of TEs highly abundant in the Human Genome that account for nearly 10% of its size (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). <italic>Alu</italic> retrotransposons derive from the 7SL RNA and are highly abundant in non-coding genomic regions including upstream promoters and gene introns (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Previous studies have shown that global transposon activity varies under diverse cellular conditions; yet, very little is known regarding the mechanisms through which TEs regulate the expression of specific genes (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In this context, a recent study revealed that an <italic>Alu</italic> element inserted in human chromosome 9p21 within the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) <italic>ANRIL</italic> was needed to <italic>trans</italic>-regulate genes presumably involved in atherosclerosis (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In the mouse, <italic>Anril</italic> lncRNA regulated cell proliferation and differentiation through the <italic>Cdkn2A/B</italic> gene (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Notably, TEs are potential carriers of binding sites for transcription factors. Genome-wide analyses have found an enrichment of binding sites for ESR1, TP53, OCT4 (POU5F1), SOX2 and CTCF in human TEs (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In fact, TEs provide up to 25% of the binding sites for the pluripotency regulators OCT4 (POU5F1) and NANOG and for the chromatin remodeler CTCF in both human and mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Consequently, it appears plausible that TEs assume an important role in the control of transcriptional programs that regulate cell turnover and plasticity (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Furthermore, certain classes of TEs were upregulated whereas others were downmodulated during the reprogramming of differentiated cells into induced pluripotent stem (iPSc) cells, thus producing an expression profile reminiscent of that of ES cells (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Overall, these former studies suggest that TEs could modulate specific transcriptional programs that drive pluripotency and cell reprogramming (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Previous work from our laboratory identified a novel B1-SINE retrotransposon (B1-X35S) widely represented in upstream regulatory regions of the mouse genome that acts as a genomic insulator blocking target gene expression (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). B1-X35S-dependent insulation required the interaction of transcription factors dioxin receptor (AhR) and Slug (Snai2) with their consensus sequences present in B1-X35S and the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerases III and II (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>It is becoming increasingly clear that some repetitive elements are relevant for cell functioning. Recent efforts have identified repetitive sequences with the potential to regulate gene expression and to participate in the control of specific cell processes under normal and pathological conditions (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In this work, we have investigated the functional relevance of <italic>Alu</italic> retrotransposons regulated by the dioxin receptor AHR in the differentiation of human embryonic carcinoma cells. We have focused on individual <italic>Alu</italic> elements located in the upstream regulatory regions of pluripotency genes <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4</italic>. AHR exerted a pro-differentiation role that was responsible, at least in part, for the repression of <italic>OCT4</italic> and <italic>NANOG</italic>. Interestingly, such repressive mechanism appears to be mediated by non-coding RNA transcripts produced by RNA polIII from the <italic>Alu</italic> elements following AHR binding. In fact, the <italic>NANOG Alu</italic> was able to repress the expression of both <italic>OCT4</italic> and <italic>NANOG</italic> in the absence of a differentiating stimulus. Among the mechanisms that could repress <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4</italic> in differentiated carcinoma cells, processing and loading of <italic>NANOG Alu</italic>-derived transcripts into the miRNA machinery appears as a plausible possibility. In sum, we suggest that individual <italic>Alu</italic> retrotransposons could have a causal role in the control of complex cellular functions such as differentiation and pluripotency. The regulatory mechanism proposed here could also contribute to establish gene expression programs required for cellular reprogramming and for the maintenance of an undifferentiated state.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Antibodies</title><p>The following antibodies were used: &#x003b2;III-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-58888, clone TUJ-1), GAP43 (Millipore AB-5220), Tau (generous gift of Dr Lorenzo-Benayas, University of Extremadura), GAPDH (Cell Signaling 2118, clone 14C10), OCT4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-5279, clone C-10), NANOG (AbCam Ab-21624), AGO2 (Millipore 03&#x02013;110), AHR (ENZO Life Sciences BML-SA210 and Immunostep 130605&#x02013;1) and &#x003b2;-Actin (Sigma A2066).</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-2"><title>Cells lines and reagents</title><p>Human embryonic teratocarcinoma NTERA-wt and NTERA-sh cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine at 37&#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere.

Consistent with their pluripotent phenotype, treatment of NTERA cells growing at low cell density with RA produced highly compact clones (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) having increased expression of the neuronal markers Tau, &#x003b2;III-tubulin and GAP43 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">C</xref>). This differentiation phenotype of NTERA cells is consistent with that reported in previous studies (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Notably, total cellular levels of AHR significantly increased during RA-induced differentiation of NTERA cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>), suggesting a role for this receptor in the process. To test this hypothesis, we used retroviral transduction to stably knockdown AHR expression in NTERA cells by means of short hairpin RNAs (NTERA-sh). This experimental approach was very efficient in reducing AHR protein to very low levels in basal and RA-treated cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). To avoid caveats derived from the use of retrovirally-transduced cells, we decided to work with a pool of NTERA cells after puromycin selection rather than using individual interfered clones. AHR depletion produced spread clones (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) with a significant reduction in the expression of neuronal markers Tau, &#x003b2;III-tubulin and GAP43 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">C</xref>). Moreover, AHR depleted cells had an almost negligible response to RA-induced differentiation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">C</xref>). The undifferentiated phenotype caused by AhR downmodulation in basal and RA-treated NTERA cells was not associated with significant changes in cell cycle distribution as determined by FACS analysis (Supplementary Figure S1A). Previous reports have shown that AHR depletion could be relevant for mouse ES cell maintenance (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and for mouse melanoma cells to develop an undifferentiated and metastatic phenotype (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In agreement, AHR-depleted NTERA-sh cells had increased levels of stem-like markers CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD133<sup>+</sup>/CD29<sup>+</sup>, more potential to form spheres under low attachment growing conditions and reduced levels of differentiation-related dehydrogenase activity than wild-type NTERA cells (Supplementary Figure S1B&#x02013;G).

However, their functional and biological significance remains to be determined. Using a previously developed Perl script (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), we have identified XRE sites for AHR binding that happen to be included within repetitive sequences that are located in the promoter of pluripotency genes <italic>NANOG, OCT4, SOX2</italic> and <italic>KLF4</italic>.

Transcription of <italic>Alu</italic> retrotransposons was analyzed by deep sequencing of small RNA molecules (RNAseq) isolated from NTERA-wt and NTERA-sh cells under basal and RA-differentiated conditions. Raw RNAseq data have been deposited in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA, NCBI) with submission number PRJNA301447. Previous work has shown that RNAseq is a useful tool to identify transcripts produced from individual <italic>Alu</italic> elements by RNA polIII (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). To avoid sequencing mRNAs and long non-coding RNA transcripts, libraries were made using size-selected small RNA populations (Supplementary Figure S4A, ncRNA). Bioinformatic alignment of the RNAseq data against <italic>OCT4</italic> and <italic>NANOG Alus</italic> identified transcripts produced from the <italic>OCT4-Alu</italic> (hereafter <italic>OCT4 Alu</italic>-T) and <italic>NANOG-Alu</italic> (hereafter <italic>NANOG Alu</italic>-T1 and <italic>Alu</italic>-T2) under basal conditions in NTERA-wt cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Notably, the level of those transcripts was significantly increased by RA-induced differentiation in NTERA-wt cells but not in NTERA-sh cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Importantly, the level of <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4 Alu</italic>-derived transcripts was significantly higher than the predicted background level between <italic>AluSq</italic> and <italic>AluSx</italic> elements (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, black dotted line). We have previously found that transcription of an AhR-regulated murine SINE-B1 retrotransposon takes place mainly in the antisense orientation (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Similarly, the analysis of RNAseq data indicated that both <italic>OCT4</italic> and <italic>NANOG Alus</italic> were preferentially transcribed in the antisense direction, despite the presence of sense transcripts produced from the <italic>NANOG Alu</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-4"><title>AHR and RNA polIII are involved in <italic>OCT4</italic> and <italic>NANOG</italic> repression in differentiated carcinoma cells</title><p>Most human <italic>Alu</italic>s are transcribed by RNA polIII, which can be inhibited by the molecules tagetitoxin (TGT) (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) and WYE132 (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). TGT treatment significantly blocked the repression of <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4</italic> produced by RA at the mRNA level in NTERA-wt cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Control experiments showed that TGT was a potent RNA polIII inhibitor in NTERA cells able to efficiently inhibit <italic>Leu</italic> tRNA expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). In addition, NTERA-wt cells had a similar response to WYE132, which could also efficiently block the repression of <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4</italic> by RA (Supplementary Figure S4B). WYE132 was an RNA polIII inhibitor in NTERA cells since it could repress <italic>Leu</italic> tRNA expression (Supplementary Figure S4C) without significantly affecting <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4</italic> mRNAs in the absence of RA treatment (e.g. WYE132 did not inhibit RNA polII) (Supplementary Figure S4D).

Considering the repetitive nature of <italic>Alu</italic> elements, we first interrogated the Human Genome for the presence of instances identical to either <italic>NANOG</italic> or <italic>OCT4 Alus</italic>. At the current sequence resolution of the Human Genome, we did not find any other <italic>Alu</italic> elements fully homologous to those present in <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4</italic> promoters. Based on this finding, we then decided to map putative sites in the Human Genome having full sequence identity with the transcripts produced from the <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4 Alus</italic>. This approach would give us an accurate estimation on to what extent those transcripts were produced from the <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4 Alus</italic> (since both elements appear at unique locations in the Human Genome) and not from other related retrotransposons.

Based on these results, transcript-specific RT-qPCR assays were designed to quantify the expression of <italic>OCT4</italic>- and <italic>NANOG-Alu</italic>-derived transcripts (Supplementary Figure S5A and B).

Consistently, ChIP experiments showed that FICZ was able to induce AHR binding to the <italic>NANOG Alu</italic> in NTERA-wt cells to a level similar to that produced by RA treatment (Supplementary Figure S6D).

To do that, NTERA-wt cells were retrovirally engineered to stably express an shRNA molecule targeting the 3&#x02032;UTR of the human AHR (NTERA-sh 3&#x02032;UTR); this approach allowed transfection of a human AHR coding sequence not targeted by the 3&#x02032;UTR shRNA molecule (Supplementary Table S1). NTERA-sh 3&#x02032;UTR cells had an almost complete loss of AHR expression, increased basal protein levels of OCT4 and very low expression of neuronal markers &#x003b2;III-tubulin and Tau, consistent with the results presented above (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Similar data were obtained using two different shRNA molecules and two different pools of NTERA cells, excluding potential off-target effects in the observed phenotype. Restoring AHR expression in NTERA-sh 3&#x02032;UTR cells by transient transfection mimicked the effects induced by RA with respect to the expression of OCT4 and the neuronal differentiation markers &#x003b2;III-tubulin and Tau (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>).

The selected mutations were highly effective in blocking <italic>NANOG Alu</italic> transcription from its internal RNA polIII promoter since the levels of <italic>NANOG Alu</italic>-T1 and <italic>Alu</italic>-T2 transcripts were largely reduced in NTERA-wt cells transfected with the promoter-less pUC57 vector harboring the XREmut, A + Bmut or XRE/A + Bmut sequences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E</xref>). Notably, mutation of the XRE sites (XREmut), the A and B boxes (A + Bmut) or both (XREmut/A + B mut) significantly blocked the ability of the <italic>NANOG Alu</italic> to repress the mRNA expression of <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7F</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">G</xref>), confirming that, in the absence of transcription from the <italic>NANOG Alu</italic>, the repressive mechanism was markedly impaired.

H9 cells treated with RA significantly increased their AHR protein levels while markedly decreased their OCT4 and NANOG protein content (Supplementary Figure S8A). Downmodulation of pluripotency factors OCT4 and NANOG likely arose from a significant reduction in their mRNA levels after RA treatment (Supplementary Figure S8B). Importantly, RA treatment largely increased the expression of the <italic>Alu</italic>-T1 and <italic>Alu</italic>-T2 transcripts derived from the <italic>NANOG Alu</italic> while moderately enhanced the amount of the <italic>OCT4 Alu-T</italic> transcript (Supplementary Figure S8C). Next, H9 cells were transiently transfected with the same sh-AHR construct used to generate the stable NTERA-sh cell line analyzed above. AHR knockdown produced a significant increase in the protein levels of both OCT4 and NANOG as compared to wild-type H9 cells (Supplementary Figure S9A). Consistently, AHR downmodulation upregulated the mRNA levels of both genes in H9 cells (Supplementary Figure S9B). Furthermore, a transient reduction in AHR expression decreased the levels of <italic>NANOG Alu-</italic>T1 and <italic>Alu-</italic>T2 transcripts without having a significant effect in the <italic>OCT4 Alu</italic>-T transcript (Supplementary Figure S9C). Therefore, AHR appears to be able to regulate pluripotency factors OCT4 and NANOG and the expression of transcripts derived from the NANOG and OCT4 Alus not only in tumorigenic NTERA cells but also in untransformed H9 human ES cells.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-7"><title><italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4</italic> repression by <italic>Alu</italic>-derived transcripts involves the miRNA machinery</title><p>Previous studies have shown that the component of the miRNA pathway Microprocessor (DGCR8 and DROSHA) can bind transcripts produced from <italic>Alu</italic> and LINE-1 (long interspersed element-1) retrotransposons (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). It is also known that small non-coding RNAs produced by DICER/AGO3 from <italic>Alu</italic>s containing the DR2 motif can modulate the proliferation of human stem cells (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). A DR2 element is defined as a 6-bp direct repeat of the retinoid acid receptor (RAR) binding site spaced by 2 nt (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Based on these previous studies, we investigated whether the miRNA machinery was involved in the <italic>Alu</italic>-dependent regulation of <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4</italic>. First, we treated NTERA-wt cells with the RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) inhibitor ATA (aurintricarboxylic acid) (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) and found that ATA significantly prevented the repression of <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4</italic> caused by RA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">B</xref>).

Control experiments confirmed that dominant-negative forms of DROSHA and DGCR8 efficiently inhibited the miRNA pathway based on the accumulation of the pre-miR-24-1 (Supplementary Figure S7F).

Among the different <italic>Alu</italic> lineages known, some ancient genomic <italic>AluS</italic> contain an active core sequence in terms of retrotransposition ability (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In addition, it has been suggested that they could be active in somatic tissues as the human brain (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Furthermore, there is an increasing interest in identifying <italic>Alu</italic> elements whose activation could contribute to human disease, such as that inserted into the ANRIL long non-coding RNA (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we have presented data suggesting that the dioxin receptor AHR regulates the transcription of <italic>Alu</italic> elements located in the upstream promoter regions of the pluripotency genes <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4</italic>, and that <italic>Alu</italic>-derived transcripts probably repress the expression of both genes in differentiated carcinoma cells possibly through the miRNA pathway. Our study therefore integrates the activation of specific <italic>Alu</italic> elements in the control of important cellular functions such as differentiation and pluripotency.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that AHR acts as a differentiation factor in human embryonic teratocarcinoma cells because its stable knockdown led to a basal undifferentiated phenotype that made cells unresponsive to RA-induced neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, differentiation increased the cellular levels of AHR and promoted its nuclear translocation, thus suggesting increased transcriptional activity of this receptor. The role of AHR in differentiation is also supported by <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, as teratomas produced by AHR-depleted NTERA cells were more undifferentiated than those from AHR-expressing NTERA cells. These results are consistent with the activation of AHR during differentiation of mouse ES cells (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and with the inhibitory role of mouse AHR in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and in melanoma primary tumorigenesis and metastasis (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>AHR has been extensively characterized as a transcription factor that binds the promoter region of xenobiotic-related and xenobiotic-unrelated genes (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). It is remarkable that AHR can also interact with specific repetitive retrotransposon sequences such as the murine B1-SINE to trigger the activation of a genomic insulator eventually able to modulate gene expression (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Binding to TEs appears to be a conserved property of AHR, as we show here that it can also directly binds to human <italic>AluS</italic> retrotransposons located in the promoter region of the pluripotency genes <italic>OCT4</italic> and <italic>NANOG</italic>. However, a complex interplay between AHR binding and <italic>AluS</italic> sequences seems to occurs, since differentiation recruits AHR to the <italic>NANOG Alu</italic> while releasing it from the <italic>OCT4 Alu</italic>. One possible explanation for these results is that the increase in nuclear AHR that takes place during differentiation could shift the receptor from the <italic>OCT4</italic> to the <italic>NANOG Alu</italic>, inducing at the same time the co-recruitment of OCT4 to the <italic>NANOG Alu</italic>. This would imply that AHR can cooperate with OCT4 in repressing <italic>NANOG</italic> expression and, thus, integrates this receptor into the proposed &#x02018;pluripotency core regulatory circuitry&#x02019; of transcription factors that also includes SOX2 and that governs differentiation in human and mouse ES cells (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). In fact, AHR activation by its non-toxic ligand FICZ produced a robust binding of OCT4 to the <italic>NANOG Alu</italic> in absence of RA.</p><p>Notably, the repression of <italic>Alu</italic>-containing <italic>OCT4</italic> and <italic>NANOG</italic> genes in differentiated NTERA cells is AHR dependent based on the lack of response shown by AHR-depleted cells, and appears to be specific since it does not take place in other examined <italic>Alu</italic>-containing pluripotency genes such as <italic>SOX2, NOTCH1, MYC</italic> and <italic>KLF4</italic>. Importantly, the repression process seemed to require the synthesis of non-coding RNA molecules since blockade of RNA polymerase III restored <italic>OCT4</italic> and <italic>NANOG</italic> expression in an AHR-dependent manner. Notably, and as RNA polIII may transcribe 7SL RNAs and other non-coding sequences (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>), we speculated that transcripts derived from the <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4 Alus</italic> could participate in the repression of both genes. Indeed, RNAseq and RT-qPCR experiments revealed that differentiation of NTERA cells increased the levels of transcripts derived from <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4 Alus</italic>, being predominant those synthesized from the <italic>NANOG Alu</italic>. In agreement with the gene expression data, transcription of these <italic>Alu</italic> elements is AHR dependent because their levels are upregulated by AHR knockdown in RA differentiated cells and increased by AHR rescue in RA-untreated cells. Such AHR-dependent mechanism regulating the expression of <italic>OCT4, NANOG</italic> and <italic>NANOG Alu</italic>-derived transcripts may be operative in non-transformed human cells since RA treatment and AHR knockdown reproduced in human H9 ES cells the same regulatory pattern to that observed in embryonic carcinoma NTERA cells. One important observation is that the <italic>Alu</italic> retrotransposons located in <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4</italic> promoters have a high degree of sequence specificity, not been detectable at additional locations in the Human Genome. This property most likely determines that <italic>NANOG</italic>- and <italic>OCT4 Alu</italic>-derived transcripts have full sequence identity and full homology only to the chromosomal regions where their respective <italic>Alus</italic> are located and from which they are transcribed. Another relevant finding from this study is that expression of these <italic>Alu</italic> elements, by themselves, could regulate <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4</italic> during carcinoma cell differentiation. We consider this result relevant since a deep transcriptome profiling study has shown that non-coding transcripts derived from long terminal repeats can associate to enhancers of pluripotency related genes (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Nevertheless, the effects of <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4 Alus</italic> in gene repression appear to have a significant degree of specificity regarding not only to the <italic>Alu</italic> element but also their target genes. Indeed, expression of <italic>NANOG Alu</italic> from its endogenous promoter repressed both <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4</italic> mRNAs in absence of a differentiation stimulus. In contrast, expression of <italic>OCT4 Alu</italic> does not significantly affect either gene under the same experimental conditions. Additionally, whereas <italic>NANOG Alu</italic> most likely regulates the <italic>NANOG</italic> gene in <italic>cis</italic>, its effects on the <italic>OCT4</italic> gene could be done in <italic>trans</italic>. Such mechanism would resemble the one recently proposed for the long non-coding RNA ANRIL that regulates atherosclerosis genes in <italic>trans</italic> by means of an <italic>Alu</italic> element present in its sequence (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Alternatively, the <italic>NANOG Alu</italic> could act on <italic>OCT4</italic> by an indirect mechanism involving signaling through <italic>NANOG</italic> itself. Nonetheless, this possible functional connection between <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4</italic> again supports the &#x02018;pluripotency core regulatory circuitry&#x02019; mentioned above that would also include AHR (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Finally, expression of <italic>NANOG Alu</italic> efficiently repressed <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4</italic> but not other genes containing similar <italic>Alu</italic> elements such as <italic>SOX2, LIN28</italic> and <italic>NR5A2</italic>. Although we cannot rule out at present time that other <italic>Alu loci</italic> dispersed in the Human Genome might contribute to the generation of additional ncRNAs, when combined with the ChIP data, our results strongly support that <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4 Alu</italic>-derived transcripts may be involved in the regulation of pluripotency.</p><p>Interestingly, recent studies in rice have shown that the plant DICER homolog DICER-like 3 can use TE RNAs to generate small interfering RNAs (siRNA) with the potential to change some agricultural traits of the plant (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). Similarly, in human cells, the Microprocessor can interact and process transcripts derived from <italic>Alus</italic> and LINE-1 to regulate retrotransposition, although it is not clear whether processed RNAs give rise to functional miRNAs that might help to regulate the expression of cellular genes (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Notably, we found that chemical inhibition of the miRNA pathway by ATA not only rescued <italic>OCT4</italic> and <italic>NANOG</italic> repression in differentiated cells but also increased the expression of <italic>NANOG Alu</italic>-T1 and <italic>Alu</italic>-T2 and <italic>OCT4 Alu</italic>-T transcripts. Furthermore, dominant negative forms of Microprocessor components DROSHA and DGCR8 also blocked the repression of <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4</italic> induced by the <italic>NANOG Alu</italic> in absence of RA. Intriguingly, the interaction between the miRNA pathway and transcripts derived from retrotransposons could be functionally conserved since inhibition of the Microprocessor also increased the levels of LINE1-derived transcripts and the expression of their target genes (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>Although the mechanism by which <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4 Alu</italic>-derived transcripts may regulate gene expression require further experimentation, we speculate that it probably involves the interaction of <italic>Alu</italic>-derived transcripts with the 3&#x02032;UTR region of the <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4</italic> mRNAs. Several experiments support this model. First, <italic>NANOG Alu</italic>-T1 and <italic>Alu</italic>-T2 and <italic>OCT4 Alu</italic>-T transcripts are loaded into the RISC component AGO2 and such loading significantly increased with differentiation of NTERA cells. Second, a marked sequence similarity exists between <italic>NANOG Alu</italic>-T1 and <italic>Alu</italic>-T2 transcripts and the 3&#x02032;UTR region of <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4</italic> mRNAs. Third, the <italic>NANOG Alu</italic> was able to regulate the 3&#x02032;UTR of <italic>NANOG</italic> but only if the homology sequences for the <italic>Alu</italic>-T1 and <italic>Alu</italic>-T2 transcripts remained intact. Finally, the levels of miRNAs involved in differentiation such as <italic>Let7</italic> and <italic>miR141</italic> increased with time by RA treatment in NTERA-wt but not in NTERA-sh cells and, interestingly, the expression of <italic>NANOG Alu</italic>-T1 and <italic>Alu</italic>-T2 preceded the accumulation of <italic>Let7</italic> and <italic>miR141</italic>. It will be interesting to address the processing and identity of these <italic>Alu</italic>-derived transcripts and the mechanisms by which they probably interact with the 3&#x02032;UTR regions of both genes. Our working model proposing that the interaction of <italic>Alu</italic> derived-transcripts with 3&#x02032;UTRs could regulate gene expression through the miRNA pathway has been also considered in previous studies. Indeed, bioinformatic analyses have shown that certain small RNAs have the potential to target <italic>Alu</italic>-complementary sequences located in the 3&#x02032;UTR of human mRNAs (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Moreover, the FANTOM4 project has revealed that retrotransposons located in the 5&#x02032; end of mouse and human protein coding genes (as is the case for <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4 Alus</italic>) have the potential to be transcribed into non-coding RNAs. Importantly, this study also indicates that a large fraction of the expressed transcripts that contain retrotransposon complementary sequences in their 3&#x02032;UTRs have lower expression levels than retrotransposon-free transcripts (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). Accordingly, we have found that the <italic>NANOG</italic> mRNA contains an <italic>AluY</italic> element in its 3&#x02032;UTR that is highly homologous with ncRNAs generated from the <italic>AluSx</italic> located in the <italic>NANOG</italic> promoter. However, the 3&#x02032;UTR of the <italic>OCT4</italic> mRNA has only partial homology with <italic>NANOG Alu</italic>-derived transcripts, suggesting the existence of subtle differences in regulation between both genes.</p><p>In sum, we propose that AHR activates the transcription of <italic>Alu</italic> retrotransposons located in the <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4</italic> upstream promoter regions in differentiated human carcinoma cells. Non-coding RNA transcripts produced from these <italic>Alus</italic> could repress <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4</italic> expression probably through the miRNA pathway (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9E</xref>). <italic>OCT4</italic> and <italic>NANOG</italic> repression in differentiated cells is AHR and RNA polIII dependent and, notably, the expression of the <italic>NANOG Alu</italic> is able to repress both genes in the absence of a differentiating stimuli. This regulatory mechanism could be relevant for normal and tumor cell growth and dissemination. Moreover, the results included in this study reveal how fixed TEs can participate in Human Genome regulation by a novel mechanism involving non-coding RNAs and the miRNA pathway (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC5"><title>ACCESSION NUMBERS</title><p>Sequence Read Archive (SRA, NCBI).
