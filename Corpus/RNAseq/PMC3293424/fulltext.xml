However, none of the current algal model species are competitive production strains. Here we present a draft genome sequence and a genetic transformation method for the marine microalga <italic>Nannochloropsis gaditana</italic> CCMP526. We show that <italic>N. gaditana</italic> has highly favourable lipid yields, and is a promising production organism. The genome assembly includes nuclear (~29 Mb) and organellar genomes, and contains 9,052 gene models. We define the genes required for glycerolipid biogenesis and detail the differential regulation of genes during nitrogen-limited lipid biosynthesis. Phylogenomic analysis identifies genetic attributes of this organism, including unique stramenopile photosynthesis genes and gene expansions that may explain the distinguishing photoautotrophic phenotypes observed. The availability of a genome sequence and transformation methods will facilitate investigations into <italic>N. gaditana</italic> lipid biosynthesis and permit genetic engineering strategies to further improve this naturally productive alga.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="i1" xlink:href="ncomms1688-i1.jpg"/>Algae show much promise in the production of biofuels owing to their high photoautotrophic biomass and lipid production rates.

Various strains of <italic>Nannochloropsis</italic> have been investigated for their biomass and lipid production characteristics, and several isolates have been grown for aquaculture purposes. <italic>N. salina, N. oculata</italic> and <italic>N. gaditana</italic> have received the most attention because of their exceptional lipid production characteristics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. <italic>N. gaditana</italic> has high photoautotrophic biomass and lipid production rates and can grow to high densities (&#x0003e;10 g l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) while tolerating a wide range of conditions with regards to pH, temperature and salinity. <italic>N. gaditana</italic> is therefore a good candidate for development into a model organism for algal biofuel production, and the availability of a genome sequence and reliable transformation protocols are required advances in this direction.

The yields from <italic>N. gaditana</italic> cultures grown in f/2 medium at 50% seawater salinity are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1a,b</xref>.

Lipid body accumulation can be triggered/enhanced in most algae by nitrogen deprivation or other stress conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, and the high lipid content (47.5%) in actively growing cultures of <italic>N. gaditana</italic> is likely facilitated by the rapid depletion of nitrate in dense cultures (3&#x02013;8 g l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) during growth. Optimal lipid yields were obtained with a starting culture density of ~3.6 g l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. It is likely that lack of light penetration due to self-shading is the main limiting factor for cultures at higher starting densities. Low-density cultures (&#x0003c;0.5 g l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) can be growth inhibited by high light (&#x0003e;200 &#x003bc;E) but the higher density cultures have good production between 1,000 &#x003bc;E and 2,000 &#x003bc;E. For medium to high-density cultures (3&#x02013;10 g l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), no substantial increase in productivity is observed on increasing the light from 1,000 &#x003bc;E to 2,000 &#x003bc;E, supporting the hypothesis that self shading becomes the limiting factor at these densities. The laboratory productivity numbers have been extrapolated to calculate potential lipid yields in comparison with other algae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>) and to other biofuel production platforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>).

This analysis confirms the close evolutionary proximity between the Eustigmatophyceae and Phaeophyceae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>), and provides us with 2,733 genes that are exclusive to <italic>N. gaditana</italic>, not found in the other algal genomes queried. This corresponds to 30.2% of the total gene repertoire in <italic>N. gaditana</italic>, which is similar to the fraction of unique genes found in <italic>T. pseudonana</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, <italic>E. siliculosus</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> and <italic>P. tricornutum</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Comparison of <italic>N. gaditana</italic> gene models to the non-redundant protein database (BLASTp) yielded top hits from a variety of organisms, the most frequent being stramenopiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>), which was expected on the basis of the phylogeny of <italic>N. gaditana</italic>.</p><p>Previous attempts have been made at establishing the minimal essential set of genes needed for photosynthesis, the 'GreenCut' of photosynthetic genes, which is a set of 597 orthologues that are conserved in plant and green algal lineages, but not in non-photosynthetic organisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. We decided to take advantage of the fact that there are both photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic stramenopiles to generate an analogous set of genes conserved in photosynthetic stramenopiles. To establish this 'StramenopilePhotoCut' of photosynthetic genes, orthologues common to <italic>N. gaditana</italic> and four photosynthetic stramenopiles (<italic>E. siliculosus, A. anophagefferens, T. pseudonana</italic> and <italic>P. tricornutum</italic>), but not present in non-photosynthetic stramenopiles (<italic>Phytophtora sojae, Phytophtora ramorum, Phytophtora infestans, Albugo laibachii</italic> or <italic>Blastocystis hominis</italic>), were selected, resulting in a list of 363 genes. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). The majority of these genes have orthologues in the green and red algal lineages and 115 are found in the 'GreenCut2'<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. However, 39 genes with homologues only found in photosynthetic stramenopiles are present in the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). Similar to many genes found in the 'GreenCut', some of the 39 stramenopile-specific 'StramenopilePhotoCut' genes are of completely unknown function, but several of the genes have known domains, including several peptidases/proteases, DNA-binding proteins/transcription factors, and transport proteins, as well as genes that are thought to directly interact with the photosystems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Because of the high photoautotrophic growth rates exhibited by <italic>N. gaditana</italic>, we also characterized the complete pathways for synthesis of chlorophyll and accessory pigments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). All expected genes could be identified except for those encoding the mevalonate (MVA) pathway for isopentenyl-pyrophosphate biosynthesis (see the analysis of bioenergy metabolic pathways).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Bioenergy metabolic pathways</title><p>To investigate metabolic pathways of interest for biofuel production, functional annotations were assigned to <italic>N. gaditana</italic> gene models. Gene ontology terms (GO-terms) were assigned to 3,838 gene models, from which 2,766 genes were identified as performing enzyme-catalysed reactions representing 700 unique EC numbers that were in turn used to populate metabolic pathway maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). Some of the most frequent GO-terms, aside from housekeeping functions, are terms involved in auxin biosynthesis, photosynthesis, and lipid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). Because of the exemplary lipid production by <italic>N. gaditana</italic> cultures, we focused on characterizing lipid metabolic pathway genes, including those involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, TAG assembly and lipid activation/degradation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). BLASTp was used to identify homologues of the <italic>N. gaditana</italic> lipid metabolic genes in red/green/brown algae and diatoms. Comparison of the number of genes in each step of the lipid metabolic pathways suggests that <italic>N. gaditana</italic> has an expanded repertoire of genes involved in both TAG assembly and lipid degradation, including glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase, long-chain acyl-CoA ligase and acyl-CoA oxidase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S6</xref>). This increased number of lipid metabolic pathway genes is probably significant considering that <italic>N. gaditana</italic> has fewer total genes than all other algae used for this comparison, with the exception of <italic>C. merolae</italic>. To further examine the expansion of gene families in <italic>N. gaditana</italic>, we compared the prevalence of GO-terms with <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> and <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> using the Fisher's exact test. A selected list of over- and under-represented terms is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S7</xref>. This analysis confirms the overrepresentation of the GO-term for acyl-carrier protein biosynthetic processes and also indicates the expansion of several other gene families that may be of importance for the biomass production phenotype of <italic>N. gaditana.</italic> These include genes involved in auxin biosynthetic processes, carbon utilization, response to stress (including chemical, temperature and salt), and pyruvate metabolic processes. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 3</xref> for a more detailed analysis of these gene expansions/reductions.</p><p>To assist in the identification of genes and to improve metabolic pathway maps of <italic>N. gaditana</italic>, we sequenced the transcriptome (RNAseq) under a variety of physiological conditions. Additionally, transcriptome sequencing was conducted during logarithmic growth (low lipid production) and during stationary phase due to nitrate deprivation (high lipid production) to discover how transcriptional changes in <italic>N. gaditana</italic> modulate increased metabolic flux into lipid biosynthesis during nutrient deprivation. Genes that are most strongly regulated during these different conditions are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>. Similar to the findings in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, many of the genes that are most strongly upregulated during nitrogen deprivation are genes involved in nitrogen assimilation and protein degradation/recycling, whereas many of the most downregulated genes are involved in photosynthesis. In addition, we annotated the most highly regulated pathways on the metabolic pathway map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). This map highlights the decreased expression of genes involved in photosynthesis, carbon fixation, and oxidative phosphorylation that would be expected during stationary phase owing to nutrient deprivation. Surprisingly, few genes that are directly involved in lipid biosynthesis are transcriptionally upregulated to a significant extent. Because <italic>N. gaditana</italic> constitutively produces TAG even during logarithmic growth, a possible explanation for this low amount of differential transcript accumulation is that the lipid production machinery may already be abundant within the cell, and existing levels can manage increased metabolic flux. In support of this hypothesis, we found that genes assigned with the GO-term for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression were overrepresented in <italic>N. gaditana</italic> in comparison with <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> and <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, whereas the GO-term for transcription factors was underrepresented (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S7</xref>). Interestingly, genes involved in gluconeogenesis (fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase and phosphoglycerate kinase) are downregulated, which could help direct carbon flux away from carbohydrate biosynthesis into lipid biosynthesis. To determine the exact mechanisms of lipid accumulation during nutrient deprivation, further transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic investigations are needed.</p><p>Other pathways that are of interest for bioenergy applications are the two isoprenoid biosynthesis pathways, the mevalonate and the non-mevalonate pathways (DXP).

These mechanisms typically rely on carbonic anhydrases, which catalyse the reversible conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>). The physiological function of a carbonic anhydrase is dictated by its compartmentalization. Bicarbonate cannot passively cross membranes and has to either be transported into the cell by a bicarbonate transporter or be converted to freely diffusible CO<sub>2</sub> by extracellular carbonic anhydrases. Cytosolic carbonic anhydrases can produce HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> either for transport by a bicarbonate transporter into the chloroplast or for use in C<sub>4</sub>-like carbon-concentrating mechanisms.

However, 99% of the transformants lost the transgene after 1.5 months of cultivation, indicating that the majority of the transformants had not truly incorporated the transgene into the genome. These earlier attempts, at transformation of <italic>N. oculata</italic>, relied on the use of foreign promoters, from <italic>P. tricornutum</italic>, <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> or viral promoters and did not utilize antibiotic selection. Here we show, for the first time, the successful transformation of <italic>N. gaditana</italic>. Transformation efficiency was greatly improved by the use of endogenous promoters, identified through preliminary sequencing of the <italic>N. gaditana</italic> genome, to drive the expression of a bleomycin resistance gene. In addition, previously described protocols for the transformation of <italic>N. oculata</italic> involve the use of various enzyme mixes for creation of protoplasts before transformation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>, whereas our protocol simply relies on the use of electroporation at high field strength. We selected three promoters for use in our transformations, which included the promoters from the genes encoding &#x003b2;-tubulin (TUB, Nga00092), heat shock protein 70 (HSP, Nga07210) and the ubiquitin extension protein (UEP, Nga02115.1). The efficiency of the transformations was strongly affected by the promoter used (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>) and the most efficient transformation was achieved using the TUB promoter that resulted in an efficiency of 12.5&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>. This was achieved using a very high 12,000 V cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> field strength during the electroporation. Use of lower field strength (10,500 V cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) resulted in fivefold lower transformation efficiency (60&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>). Interestingly, the transformation efficiency using the chosen promoters approximately corresponds with the RNAseq quantification values for these genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>).

Photosynthetic algae have long been considered a possible renewable feedstock for biofuel production and have recently experienced intense interest owing to diminishing petroleum reserves and increasing atmospheric levels of CO<sub>2</sub>. One of the main challenges has been the lack of a genetically tractable model alga capable of industrial biofuels production. The availability of such an alga could eventually permit the sort of comprehensive systems-biology approaches that have been applied towards the development of highly productive strains of industrial bacteria. The characterization of the genome of <italic>N. gaditana</italic> and the identification of the genes and pathways that are involved in lipid production in this alga, in combination with the establishment of a method for genetic transformation, allows for further analysis of potential bottle necks in the TAG biosynthesis pathway and the discovery of suitable targets for gene overexpression and/or knockout. Several of the genes involved in TAG assembly, including PAP (Nga21116) and PDAT (Nga02737), have only one homologue and represent obvious targets for either overexpression for potential increased TAG production, or knockout for studying the physiological effects of attenuated TAG assembly. Several other identified gene families, such as TAG lipases (Nga30958, Nga30749) and acyl-CoA oxidases (Nga03053, Nga04370.1, Nga30819), as well as genes involved in gluconeogenesis are also interesting targets for gene knockout or knockdown for the purpose of increasing lipid production. In addition, both the carbonic anhydrases (Nga01240, Nga01717, Nga03728, Nga30848, Nga10007, Nga21222) and the putative bicarbonate transporters (Nga00165.01, Nga06584) are excellent targets for gene overexpression for improved carbon assimilation. The continued development of <italic>N. gaditana</italic> into a model for oleaginous algal biofuel production is a step towards the cost competitive photoautotrophic production of biofuels.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Growth of <italic>N. gaditana</italic></title><p><italic>N. gaditana</italic> CCMP526 (National Center for Marine Algae and Microbiota) was cultivated in a defined artificial seawater medium (ASW).

We then used software, developed in-house, for merging of the results of the best of these various attempts into a single, well-reconciled assembly that capitalizes on the relative strengths of each type of assembly software while minimizing the chance of creating redundancy. After many trials, the best result was obtained by using Newbler version 2.3 (Roche) to assemble the Roche data and convey graph constructor (CGC; Convey Computer Corporation) to assemble the Illumina data followed by scaffold creation (based on paired-end reads that fall into adjacent contigs) using Velvet version 1.0.19 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>).</p><p>To perform the merging step, all contig/scaffold sequences from the Newbler and Velvet assemblies were first aligned all-by-all using BLASTn.

The identity score was calculated as the sum of +1 for base matches, &#x02212;2 penalty for mismatches, and &#x02212;1 penalty for insertions or deletions (indels). As homopolymer errors are common issues for reads generated by the Roche platform, a lower indel penalty was used. A graph was then built with contigs as nodes and their pairings as edges, then continuously overlapping contigs were constructed in a greedy fashion, that is, the longest path wins in the case of conflict. In the case of conflict where one path is not significantly longer than the other (that is, differing in length by &#x0003c;40 nt), neither path was created. To reduce homopolymer errors from merged sequences, the consensus used the portion of the overlap taken from only the Illumina sequencing reads.</p><p>We noticed that some of the scaffolds from the first assembly were likely to be bacterial. We also found that some of these scaffolds had been created from only the Illumina sequencing reads with few or no aligning Roche reads. Considering this, and suspecting that there had been some bacterial contamination specifically in the DNA preparation used for Illumina sequencing, we conducted a systematic search based on sequence matching to either bacterial or stramenopile genomic sequences and careful manual examination. This identified 363 scaffolds that contain a total of 7 Mb that were concluded to be bacterial, which were then removed along with the five scaffolds that constituted the mitochondrial and plastid genomes, leaving 2,087 scaffolds in what we designated assembly version 1.1. To estimate genome size, we subtracted duplicated regions with 100% homology from the 2,087 scaffolds. Following these corrections we assume a genome size of ~29 Mb. It takes 257 scaffolds from the assembly to contain half of the total scaffold size (the N50 statistic), and the length of the 257th longest scaffold is 37,693 nts (the L50 statistic).
