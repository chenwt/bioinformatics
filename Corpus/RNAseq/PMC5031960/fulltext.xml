Rauvolfioideae (Apocynaceae, Gentianales) represents a major center of structural expansion in the monoterpenoid indole alkaloids (MIAs) yielding thousands of unique molecules including highly valuable chemotherapeutics. The paucity of genome-level data for Apocynaceae precludes a deeper understanding of MIA pathway evolution hindering the elucidation of remaining pathway enzymes and the improvement of MIA availability <italic>in planta</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic>. We sequenced the nuclear genome of <italic>Rhazya stricta</italic> (Apocynaceae, Rauvolfioideae) and present this high quality assembly in comparison with that of coffee (Rubiaceae, <italic>Coffea canephora</italic>, Gentianales) and others to investigate the evolution of genome-scale features. The annotated <italic>Rhazya</italic> genome was used to develop the community resource, RhaCyc, a metabolic pathway database. Gene family trees were constructed to identify homologs of MIA pathway genes and to examine their evolutionary history. We found that, unlike <italic>Coffea</italic>, the <italic>Rhazya</italic> lineage has experienced many structural rearrangements. Gene tree analyses suggest recent, lineage-specific expansion and diversification among homologs encoding MIA pathway genes in Gentianales and provide candidate sequences with the potential to close gaps in characterized pathways and support prospecting for new MIA production avenues.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The power of genomics to illuminate evolutionary hypotheses lies in the availability of sequences from both early and late branching lineages for comparative analyses. Alkaloid accumulation in plant tissues is triggered in response to the range of stress encountered by plants; for humanity the result is a pharmacopeia ranging from caffeine to heroin to some of the most important chemotherapeutic and hypertensive treatment drugs available today<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Given that plant metabolic networks have followed a descent with modification pattern<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> and the unique and variable character of monoterpenoid indole alkaloid (MIA) production throughout the angiosperm order Gentianales, genome-scale comparative analyses within the order relative to more distant lineages could provide insight on the genetic factors involved in the evolution of this highly valuable aspect of plant secondary metabolism.</p><p>Alkaloid production in plants is limited in distribution and the specific alkaloid repertoire is variable across taxa. With the exception of the MIA quinolone derivatives, i.e. camptothecin, Gentianales are the exclusive plant producers of highly valuable MIA compounds, including the bisindole topoisomerase inhibitors vincristine and vinblastine. Regardless of their final form, more than 2500 identified MIAs begin with the condensation of tryptamine and secologanin to form strictosidine, the first committed molecule in the MIA pathway. The classification of MIAs into three broad groups was based on the arrangement of the fragmented cyclic monoterpene (secologanin), Iboga (catharanthine), Corynanthe-strychnos (ajmalicine) and Aspidosperma (stemmadenine). While all families of the order contain representatives that can accumulate MIA species with the Corynathe (type I) skeleton, Rauvolfioideae, a subfamily of Apocynaceae, represents a major center of structural expansion encompassing the diversity of skeletal arrangements and an astonishing number of downstream modifications yielding thousands of unique molecules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.</p><p><italic>Rhazya stricta</italic> Decne. (2n&#x02009;=&#x02009;22; Apocynaceae, Rauvolfioideae) is an evergreen shrub abundant across Western and South Asia and is well adapted to harsh conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Like other Rauvolfioideae, <italic>Rhazya</italic> accumulates MIAs. In fact, strictosidine was first isolated from <italic>R. stricta</italic> in 1968<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. However recent study has focused mainly on <italic>Catharanthus roseus</italic> (L.) G. Don and, to a lesser extent, <italic>Rauvolfia serpentina</italic> (L.) Benth. ex Kurz and a handful of others in the family. There is an extensive literature describing chemical synthetic approaches to generate the kind of molecules produced by these species as, at least in the systems that have been studied, <italic>in vivo</italic> production is far below human demand<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Historical technological challenges to high quality assembly of complete nuclear genomes have resulted in fragmented drafts of limited use due to the exclusion of repetitive sequences and the lack of information on genome structure. Furthermore, the paucity of genome level data for Apocynaceae precludes a deeper understanding of MIA pathway evolution hindering the elucidation of remaining pathway enzymes and the potential to improve MIA availability <italic>in planta</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic>. To address this, we sequenced the nuclear genome of <italic>Rhazya stricta</italic> and present this high quality assembly in comparison with that of coffee (Rubiaceae, <italic>Coffea canephora</italic> Pierre ex A. Froehner, Gentianales) and others to investigate the evolution of genome-scale features. Using genomic and transcriptomic sequences from Rauvolfioideae along with species in the order Gentianales and beyond, we identified homologs of characterized MIA pathway genes revealing the lineage specific nature of their evolution.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>We sequenced three Illumina libraries yielding nearly 400 million reads to generate approximately 112X coverage of the <italic>R. stricta</italic> ~274&#x02009;Mb genome. To achieve the highest quality draft with minimal fragmentation we added PacBio sequencing, (&#x0003e;550K reads; 10X coverage), and isolated nuclei for optical mapping (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The final assembly contains 980 scaffolds with a maximum scaffold length of 16.4&#x02009;Mb and N50 &#x0003e;5.5&#x02009;Mb. Scaffolds of greater than 200&#x02009;Kb (113) comprise 93% of the genome sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Comparison to assembly statistics reported for three recently published nuclear genomes demonstrates the high quality of the <italic>Rhazya</italic> draft (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). A comprehensive listing of statistics for 34 non-model plant nuclear genomes was recently reported by Unamaba <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p><p>The transcriptome-guided annotation of the <italic>R. stricta</italic> genome identified 21,164 protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>), 60% of which were assigned UniProt identifiers. Comparison to a set of core eukaryotic sequences (CEGMA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> demonstrated that the <italic>R. stricta</italic> assembly captured 98% of the expected genes. The genome contains 16% transposable elements, of which 88% are long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons comprising predominantly Copia and Gypsy superfamily members. Our list of repeated elements is not exhaustive and the actual value for repeat content is likely higher (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S6</xref>). All functionally annotated transcripts, as described in the methods section, were assigned gene names, putative functions, gene ontology (GO) terms and enzyme codes by homology search (BLAST) against the UniProt database.</p><p>A metabolic pathway database, RhaCyc, was created for <italic>Rhazya</italic> using the PathoLogic component of Pathway Tools (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.ai.sri.com/ptools/">http://bioinformatics.ai.sri.com/ptools/</ext-link>). This program inferred metabolic pathways by comparing the annotated <italic>Rhazya</italic> genes to the MetaCyc 2.0 reference pathway database (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.metacyc.org">http://www.metacyc.org</ext-link>). The RhaCyc database contains information on 3380 enzymes, 2828 compounds, and 458 pathways and is available as a community resource (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rhacyc.icmb.utexas.edu:1555/">http://rhacyc.icmb.utexas.edu:1555/</ext-link>). Links to UniProt identifiers and GO terms are embedded with each annotated sequence in RhaCyc.</p><p>The high quality draft of the <italic>Coffea canephora</italic> nuclear genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> was used to examine structural changes between the two Gentianales families and relative to the ancestral post-&#x003b3; eudicot arrangement as represented by <italic>Vitis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). As in <italic>Coffea</italic>, there was no evidence to suggest a subsequent whole-genome polyploidization in the <italic>Rhazya</italic> lineage. Comparison of adjacencies within each of the <italic>Rhazya</italic> scaffolds derived from different ancestral chromosomes and those within the <italic>Coffea</italic> chromosomes allowed us to identify most of the major gene order changes in the extant genomes. While the remaining <italic>Rhazya</italic> scaffolds each tend to reflect a part of only a single ancestral chromosome, they may contain some smaller rearrangements that went undetected. With the available data we detected limited rearrangement between the core eudicot ancestor and the Gentianales ancestor, and between the latter and <italic>Coffea</italic>. In the <italic>Rhazya</italic> lineage, however, many more structural rearrangements were inferred.</p><p>To explore the evolution of MIA pathway genes we assembled a translated subject database containing transcriptomic and genomic data for sequences from <italic>Rhazya</italic> and five additional species: two Rauvolfioideae (C. <italic>roseus</italic>, <italic>R. serpentina</italic>), <italic>C</italic>. <italic>canephora</italic> (Rubiaceae), a non-Gentianales asterid (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> L.) and an alkaloid producing rosid (<italic>Theobroma cacao</italic> L. cv Matina). For homolog identification we queried the database using previously characterized MIA protein sequences from <italic>C. roseus</italic> and <italic>R. serpentina</italic>, which produce alkaloids currently employed in cancer chemotherapy and as antiarrhythmic drugs, respectively. Putative homologs for each protein were aligned and used to generate phylogenies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>) for 21 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S7</xref>). Of these, eight trees were reduced and restricted to the relevant clades as described in methods and reconciled with the species tree, depicting the history of duplication and loss for each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S8</xref>).</p><p>Generally, the families that include the eight characterized MIA genes underwent expansion as is seen in other gene families whose members participate in secondary metabolism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S8</xref>). Where genome level data, and therefore information about genetic loci, were available gene family expansion appears to have been facilitated by localized and/or tandem duplications. The two Gentianales taxa, <italic>Coffea</italic> and <italic>Rhazya</italic>, each contain proximally arrayed homologs. Within each species some homologs are grouped in distinct clades while others are dispersed across the phylogeny suggesting different evolutionary trajectories for these sequences. One example can be seen in <italic>Coffea.</italic> The full tree generated from sequences extracted using <italic>C. roseus</italic> Strictosidine &#x003b2;-glucosidase (SGD) as a query contains 157 &#x003b2;-glucosidase superfamily members (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>), 17 of which are proximally arrayed on <italic>Coffea</italic> chromosome two. Of those, eight chromosome two sequences were retained in the reconciled subtree (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). The duplications giving rise to five glucosidases (Cc02_g27160, g27180, g27190, g27230, g27290; highlighted in brown) likely occurred prior to the divergence of Gentianales while more recent duplications gave rise to three homologs that form a clade containing <italic>Coffea</italic> sequences exclusively (Cc02_g30420, g30490, g30540; highlighted in beige).</p><p>For SGD, as for all of the experimentally confirmed MIA sequences analyzed, the <italic>C. roseus</italic> and/or <italic>R. serpentina</italic> sequences downloaded from Genbank were in derived positions in the phylograms. The clades that contained the known (query) sequences were restricted to the Rauvolfioideae, however some clades also included coffee sequences following the pattern of diversification within the order and reflecting the evolution of MIA diversity and complexity.</p><p>Our analyses placed two <italic>Rhazya</italic> sequences in the clade adjacent to the GenBank SGD sequences, along with a single sequence extracted from the <italic>Rauvolfia</italic> transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2 and S3</xref>). However, SGD was not identified and annotated in the <italic>Rhazya</italic> genome. Looking more closely at these homologs, we aligned the <italic>Rhazya</italic> and <italic>Rauvolfia</italic> sequences within and between the clades. The <italic>Rauvolfia</italic> sequence grouping with the two <italic>Rhazya</italic> sequences was identified as Raucaffricine-O-&#x003b2;-D-glucosidase (RG; EC 3.2.1.125). The two <italic>Rhazya</italic> sequences and RG were 76% and 77% identical whereas identities to <italic>Rauvolfia</italic> SGD were 58% and 57% at the amino acid level.</p><p>Thus it appears that the <italic>R. stricta</italic> genome may not encode SGD, nonetheless our own mass spectrometry analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S9</xref>) along with decades of reports demonstrate the production of MIAs that derive from the reactive strictosidine aglycone, a product of SGD activity. The presence of a close homolog of RG, however, suggests another route to downstream intermediates and ultimately MIA end products. Raucaffricine, the major substrate of RG, is hydrolyzed to vomilenin, an intermediate in the ajmaline pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. While SGD is unable to hydrolyze raucaffricine, RG can catalyze the conversion of strictosidine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, and may fill that role in <italic>R. stricta</italic> cells. Identification and annotation of the SGD gene in a low quality nuclear genome draft from <italic>C. roseus</italic> proved challenging<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, however, given the depth and completeness of our assembly it is unlikely that a <italic>Rhazya</italic> SGD sequence went undetected. Recently a similar approach used to search for MIA pathway genes in <italic>Amsonia hubrichtii</italic> (Apocynaceae, Rauvolfioideae) failed to detect a high identity homolog of the <italic>C. roseus</italic> SGD. A single transcript was designated as encoding a putative SGD with 57% amino acid identity to the <italic>Catharanthus</italic> sequence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, suggesting that another &#x003b2;-glucosidase may fill the role of SGD in this species.</p><p>The incredible diversity of MIAs in the Rauvolfioidae is facilitated through the hydrolysis of strictosidine to its aglycone, which may then be converted into different structural classes and elaborated by myriad reactions, many of which have been characterized, at least for <italic>C. roseus</italic>. However the enzymatic activities responsible for directing which structural class of MIA will ultimately derive from the aglycone moiety were largely unknown, until recently. THAS activity (Tetrahydroalstonine synthase) converts the strictosidine aglycone to tetrahydroalstonine, the gateway molecule to other heteroyohimbine type alkaloids such as cathenamine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. We queried our database with the THAS amino acid sequence, extracted homologs for gene phylogenies, and produced trimmed, reconciled trees. Much like the other MIA pathway genes examined, THAS family members showed a pattern of lineage specific expansion in the Rauvolfioideae and included two sequences from <italic>R. stricta</italic> in the reduced tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). While the two proximal sequences had only 60% amino acid identity to each other, their identities to the characterized <italic>C. roseus</italic> THAS was greater, at 71% and 75%.</p><p>Access to the high quality draft of the <italic>Coffea</italic> nuclear genome, along with drafts representing other lineages outside of Gentianales, has allowed us to use the <italic>Rhazya</italic> nuclear genome comparatively to evaluate lineage specific evolution of MIA pathway sequences. However, limiting these analyses to a single representative from each lineage necessarily limits the inferences that can be drawn from comparative study. The highly fragmented draft of the <italic>C. roseus</italic> genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, while providing a useful resource for certain investigations, was not suitable for inclusion in the gene order comparisons. A more recent approach using single platform nuclear genome sequencing with PacBio generated a high quality draft for the grass genus <italic>Oropetum</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. As sequencing technologies continue to improve in terms of both data quality and expense, less fragmented draft genomes for other Apocynaceae should become more tenable for future analyses.</p><p>Nonetheless, the gene phylogeny analyses facilitated by the <italic>Rhazya</italic> sequences combined with available data indicate lineage specific expansion resulting in distinct sets of MIA enzyme homologs in the Rauvolfioideae as well as in the Gentianales. The protein sequences clustering with characterized MIA homologs provide an evolutionary insight that could guide full characterization of MIA pathways in related species. One example may be found among the homologs of <italic>C. roseus</italic> Reticuline oxidase (RO, EC 1.21.3.3). This cytochrome P450 flavoprotein is a member of the BBE (Berberine bridge enzyme) family (pfam 08031) that catalyzes carbon-carbon bond formation via oxidative cyclization. An enzyme possessing such activity has been characterized in extracts from <italic>R. serpentina</italic>, but as yet the gene for SBE (Sarpagan bridge enzyme)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> remains unknown. The inclusion of several <italic>Rauvolfia</italic> and <italic>Rhazya</italic> sequences in the clade containing <italic>C. roseus</italic> RO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2m</xref>) may indicate an avenue for future studies seeking to identify elusive MIA pathway genes.</p><p>As more high quality nuclear genome drafts become available we will be able to address genome scale hypotheses of evolution. The rearrangements in <italic>Rhazya</italic> but not <italic>Coffea</italic>, relative to their shared ancestor may suggest that genome level dynamics played a role in the evolution of chemical diversity in the Rauvolfioideae. A critical evaluation of this question would require more than a single representative from each lineage to draw meaningful conclusions.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Plant material, DNA and RNA isolation</title><p><italic>Rhazya stricta</italic> seeds were obtained from natural populations collected in the Makkah Province, Saudi Arabia.
