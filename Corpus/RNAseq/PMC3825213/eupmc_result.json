    "Pichia pastoris is widely used as a host system for heterologous protein expression in both academia and industry. Production is typically accomplished by a fed-batch induction process that is known to have negative impacts on cell physiology that impose limits on both protein yields and quality. We have analysed recombinant protein production in chemostat cultures to understand the physiological responses associated with methanol-induced production of two human lysozyme variants with different degrees of misfolding by P. pastoris. Confounding variables associated with nutrient stress or growth-rate are minimised during steady-state growth in chemostats. Comparison of transcriptome-level data obtained during the non-inducing and inducing steady states identified changes in expression of only about 1Â % of the genome during production of either an amyloidogenic human lysozyme variant prone to intracellular aggregation (I56T) or a misfolded but secretable variant (T70N), indicating near-complete acclimation to their production. A marked, but temporary, stress response involving both the unfolded protein response (UPR) and ER-associated degradation pathway was observed during the transient between steady states, particularly following induction of the T70N variant synthesis, and was accompanied by changes in expression of around 50 antisense transcripts. The results suggest that optimal heterologous protein production could best be achieved by a continuous process that minimises the number of methanol-induced transients experienced by the cultures. The processing of HAC1 mRNA required for the UPR was found to be constitutive in the culture conditions used, even in the absence of recombinant protein induction."
