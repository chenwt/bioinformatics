candidate gene studies have yielded a number of risk alleles for osteoarthritis (OA). This
number is now sufficiently large to allow conclusions to be drawn regarding the nature of
genetic susceptibility, including the fact that the risk alleles have variable effects
depending on sex, ethnicity and on the skeletal site of the disease. Several of the
alleles that have emerged from the GWASs are within or close to highly plausible candidate
genes, including <italic>RUNX2</italic> and <italic>CHST11</italic>. However, the majority
of risk alleles do not map to genes previously reported to play a role in musculoskeletal
biology, indicating that the GWAS datasets are telling us something new about the OA
disease process. Functional studies have so far revealed that effects on gene expression
are likely to be one of the main mechanisms through which OA susceptibility is acting.
Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation also influence OA risk, and integration of
genetic, transcriptomic and epigenetic data will allow us to use the genetic discoveries
for informed development of new OA biological treatments.</p></abstract><counts><table-count count="5"/><ref-count count="67"/><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a late-onset musculoskeletal disease characterised by gradual thinning
and loss of articular cartilage of the synovial joints with a concurrent alteration in the
physiology of several other joint tissues, including the subchondral bone and the synovium
(Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>). The disease is therefore one of the whole
joint (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). No OA disease modifying drugs are
available, with the current treatment regimes principally involving analgesia, physiotherapy
and, in severe forms of the disease, joint replacement (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>); a search of the National Joint Registry reveals that over 120&#x000a0;000 hip and knee
procedures are performed each year in the UK, the majority for OA (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.njrcentre.org.uk">http://www.njrcentre.org.uk</uri>). In most ethnic groups OA is extremely common, with its
prevalence and incidence varying depending on the diagnostic criteria used and on the joint
examined, with disease of the hands and of the knees being particularly prevalent (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). OA has a clear and detrimental impact on wellbeing,
with up to one-fifth of affected individuals giving up work or retiring early because of the
disease, and this increased morbidity contributes indirectly to an increased mortality (Ref.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>).</p><p>Before any molecular genetic investigations were performed, a number of epidemiological
studies had provided compelling evidence for a genetic component to OA, placing it into the
category of a polygenic and multifactorial disease (reviewed in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). Subsequent genetic linkage studies of small- to medium-sized pedigrees
failed to detect any genes harbouring OA risk alleles, although broad regions of the genome
were implicated. Successes soon followed, however, when genetic linkage was superseded by
association analysis, particularly when the association studies were conducted on large
case-control cohorts and with dense maps of polymorphic markers. These studies have been
complemented by genome-wide gene expression studies of joint tissues such that we are now in
the position whereby molecular genetics is making a contribution towards our understanding of
the pathophysiology of this common disease.</p><p>In this review we shall focus on some of the most recent and compelling OA genetic results
and on the steps taken so far to understand what functional effect OA risk alleles have on
gene and protein function.</p><sec id="sec1"><title>Genetic association analysis and candidate genes</title><p>In the last few years a number of candidate genes have been reported as harbouring risk
alleles for OA. These candidates have been chosen principally on the basis that the proteins
that they code for are regulators of joint formation and of joint maintenance. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab01">Table 1</xref> lists examples of some of the genes studied.
What has become apparent from these reports is that OA risk alleles often show ethnic
stratification, with association in Asians or in Europeans but not typically in both. This
can be attributed to differences between ethnic groups in (1) the frequencies of the risk
alleles, (2) the genetic background on which the risk alleles are operating and (3)
nongenetic (environmental) factors that modulate the impact of the risk alleles. It is also
apparent that the OA associations are often to a particular joint rather than to several
different joints. In the eight examples listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab01">Table
1</xref>, five associations are to either the hip or to the knee whereas only three are to
both joints. This is an important observation as it suggests that there is only a limited
sharing of the effects of particular OA risk alleles between skeletal sites. From a genetics
perspective, OA is not therefore a systemic disease of the whole skeleton but is instead a
more site-specific disease. Stratification by joint is therefore essential to avoid false
negative associations. <table-wrap id="tab01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Examples of genes reported as associated with osteoarthritis (OA) through candidate

<italic>GDF5</italic> and <italic>SMAD3</italic> deserve further comment.
<italic>GDF5</italic> is the most compelling candidate association signal so far reported
for OA, with the rs143383 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) showing association in both
Europeans and Asians and at a significance level of
<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;5.0&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>, a threshold that is commonly applied to
assess the veracity of genome-wide association signals (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). The gene codes for a growth factor that is part of the transforming
growth factor-beta (TGF-&#x003b2;) superfamily and the associated polymorphism, SNP rs143383, have
also been reported to be associated with a variety of other musculoskeletal phenotypes
(reviewed in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). Polymorphism in this gene
appears therefore to have a broad impact on skeletal health. The <italic>SMAD3</italic>
association is with the common SNP rs12901499 located in intron 1. <italic>SMAD3</italic>
codes for an intracellular signal transducer that also operates in the TGF-&#x003b2; pathway and
since the association of rs12901499 to OA has so far been reported in only one publication
(Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>), further studies are needed to support
the role of this SNP in OA susceptibility. Nevertheless, it is intriguing that rare and
penetrant haploinsufficient mutations within <italic>SMAD3</italic> give rise to the
aneurysms-OA syndrome, characterised by early-onset OA and aortic lesions (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). It therefore appears that SNPs such as rs12901499,
which like most common polymorphisms are expected to have relatively moderate effects on
gene function, and rare but highly detrimental mutations are acting on
<italic>SMAD3</italic> to give rise to the same broad OA phenotype. However, these arise at
widely different ages and with differing degrees of severity. This is so far the only clear
example of this phenomenon in OA. Since individuals with the <italic>SMAD3</italic>
haploinsufficient mutations have aortic abnormalities there is the possibility that carriers
of the OA risk allele of rs12901499 may be at increased risk of vascular deformities.
Research investigating the cardiovascular system in these carriers may therefore be
insightful.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Genetic association analysis and genome-wide association scans</title><p>Candidate gene studies have the advantage of targeting the known, combined with the
attraction that the investigating team has only to genotype a relatively small number of
polymorphisms to cover the gene of interest. These studies, however, have the clear
disadvantage that what is known is rarely comprehensive and that novel signals will not
therefore be uncovered. The genome-wide association scan (GWAS) circumvents these
deficiencies and, when performed on large cohorts and with replication, has the power to
overcome the issue of multiple testing. In OA there have so far been three reports of GWAS
studies combining the key requirements of extensive coverage, large cohorts and replication
in additional cohorts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab02">Table 2</xref>). <table-wrap id="tab02" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Genome-wide association scans performed utilising high genome coverage and large

<italic>P</italic>-value of 8&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> to a region of chromosome 7q22 encompassing
six known protein-coding genes (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab03">Table 3</xref>), none of which had previously been implicated
in OA. A subsequent analysis with additional cohorts marginally increased the significance
of the association (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). The Tokyo study
reported an association signal to two SNPs located within a 340 kb region of the HLA locus
on chromosome 6p, with <italic>P</italic>-values &#x0003c;7&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). The association is also with knee OA. The arcOGEN
study was performed in two stages. Initially, a GWAS was performed on 3177 cases and three
association signals were reported, but none surpassed the genome-wide significance threshold
of <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;5.0&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>). The signals were to <italic>MICAL3</italic> in knee and/or hip OA with a
<italic>P</italic>-value of 2.3&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>, to <italic>C6orf130</italic> in knee OA
with a <italic>P</italic>-value of 2.7&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> and to <italic>COL11A1</italic> in
hip OA with a <italic>P</italic>-value of 1.2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>. The number of cases
genotyped was then increased to 7410 and the GWAS was re-run. This enhanced power identified
eight novel signals, five of which were genome-wide significant (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab03">Table 3</xref>). Five of the
arcOGEN signals encompass two or more protein-coding genes with the remaining three signals
containing single genes. Several of the genes are plausible functional candidates, including
<italic>RUNX2</italic>, which codes for a transcription factor active in joint tissues,
and <italic>CHST11</italic>, which codes for an enzyme that sulfates cartilage proteoglycan.
However, the majority of the genes have not previously been suggested to have a role in OA
meaning that the arcOGEN study has provided very novel insights into OA aetiology. Body mass
index (BMI) is a known risk factor for OA but only one of the arcOGEN signals, to
<italic>FTO</italic>, was attenuated after BMI adjustment; polymorphism in
<italic>FTO</italic> is one of the strongest associations so far reported for BMI and
obesity risk. <table-wrap id="tab03" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><p>The signals from the Rotterdam genome-wide association scan (GWAS) and from the full

the OA ascertainment criteria used was critical in the discovery of the association signals.
Regarding sex, the chromosome 6p21.1 signal was only relevant to male disease whereas the
3q28, 9q33.1 and 16q12.2 signals were only relevant to female disease. Regarding joint, the
3q28 signal was only relevant to knee OA whereas the 6q13-q14.1, 9q33.1, 12p11.22 and
12q23.3 signals were only relevant to hip OA. Regarding ascertainment criteria, all the
arcOGEN cases had radiographic evidence of OA but in over 80% of the cases the disease was
so severe that the individuals had also undergone hip or knee joint replacement surgery. A
focus on these more severe cases aided the identification of several of the signals.</p><p>The minor allele frequencies (MAFs) of the SNPs that marked the arcOGEN association signals
were quite common, all &#x0003e;10%. An analysis of the initial arcOGEN GWAS for less common
alleles identified another association, with SNP rs11842874 (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). This SNP has a MAF of 7% and resides within an intron of
<italic>MCF2L</italic>, which codes for the protein guanine nucleotide exchange factor
DBS. The association surpasses the genome-wide significance threshold, with a
<italic>P</italic>-value of 2.1&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>.</p><p>The large arcOGEN dataset has so far been used in two related studies, the first
investigating an association between DNA variants of the mitochondrial genome and OA and the
second investigating an overlap between alleles for height, BMI and OA. For many years
dysfunction of mitochondria has been implicated in OA aetiology and there is some evidence
that polymorphism of mitochondrial DNA may mediate this, although the genetic studies so far
performed have been on relatively small cohorts (reviewed in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). The array used by arcOGEN provided robust genotype data for 48
common mitochondrial variants, which provided good coverage of the mitochondrial genome.
However, no association with OA was observed in the comparison of 7393 arcOGEN cases and
5122 controls (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>). It appears unlikely
therefore, that common mitochondrial DNA variants are major contributors to OA
susceptibility, at least not in the north European population that is represented by the
arcOGEN study. It has been postulated that there may be overlap between the development of
OA and natural variation in skeletogenesis, based on the assumption that efficient
developmental patterning of the skeleton is essential for creation and maintenance of
healthy joints. The discovery that <italic>GDF5</italic> SNP rs143383 is one of the many
polymorphisms associated with natural variation in height (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>) clearly links skeletogenesis and OA. Furthermore, the subsequent
discovery that due to its correlation with height, the OA-associated T-allele of this SNP is
subjected to positive selection implies that OA genetic aetiology may partly be hitchhiking
onto the evolution events of skeletogenesis (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>). However, although there was some initial suggestion from the arcOGEN study of
an excess overlap of association signals between OA and height and between OA and BMI, only
the BMI signal at <italic>FTO</italic> replicated (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>). This suggests that, apart from a few clear examples, there is not yet any
compelling evidence of a major correlation between the alleles for height and OA or between
the alleles for BMI and OA.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Functional studies on <italic>GDF5</italic> SNP rs143383</title><p>Having identified compelling genetic signals, the next step is the functional analyses of
these to assess how the associated alleles modulate gene or protein function. In this
regard, studies on OA-associated SNP rs143383 act as an exemplar.</p><p>rs143383 is a C to T transition located within the 5&#x02032; untranslated region (5&#x02032;UTR) of
<italic>GDF5</italic>, which codes for the extracellular signalling molecule growth
differentiation factor 5. In the paper that first reported the association between rs143383
and OA, the investigators demonstrated that the OA-risk T-allele of the SNP-mediated reduced
mRNA expression relative to the C-allele in an in vitro luciferase assay conducted in a
chondrocyte cell line; chondrocytes are the only cell type present in cartilage (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>). This experiment therefore highlighted rs143383 as
the actual functional SNP responsible for the association signal. GDF5 protein is an
anabolic extracellular signalling molecule required for joint formation and maintenance and
this functional study implied that OA susceptibility at rs143383 acts by reducing the levels
of GDF5 protein. Soon after this in vitro study, it was demonstrated that the T-allele
correlated with reduced expression of <italic>GDF5</italic> in cartilage (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>). This result was obtained by an analysis of the
expression of the gene using RNA directly extracted from the cartilage of OA patients, who
had undergone elective joint replacement surgery. The patients studied were heterozygous for
rs143383, allowing a direct comparison of the expression of the T-allele versus the
C-allele. The allelic expression imbalance (AEI) between the C- and T-alleles of rs143383
also occurs in other joint tissues (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>),
emphasising that OA is a disease of the whole joint. A second <italic>GDF5</italic> 5&#x02032;UTR
SNP, rs143384, was discovered that modulates the effect that rs143383 has on gene
expression. This result revealed that the activity of an OA susceptibility allele could be
context-specific. A search of the <italic>GDF5</italic> 3&#x02032;UTR then identified rs56366915 as
a SNP that also causes AEI, but independently of rs143383 (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>). The subsequent use of electrophoretic mobility shift assays
(EMSAs), EMSA-supershifts, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and RNA knockdown identified
the trans-acting factors Sp1, Sp3, P15 and DEAF-1 as binding differentially to the T- and
C-alleles of rs143383 and mediating the AEI (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>).

<italic>GDF5</italic> in a cohort of 992 OA cases and 944 controls did not detect any
additional common variants, implying that there are no other <italic>GDF5</italic>
polymorphisms that can, at the population level, influence OA susceptibility (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>). This sequence analysis did however detect six
unique variants, one of which is located in the promoter of <italic>GDF5</italic>. A
subsequent functional study demonstrated that this promoter variant is a binding site for
the trans-acting factor YY1 and that the unique A-allele of the variant can neutralise the
reduced expression that is mediated by the OA-associated T-allele of rs143383 (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>). This result again demonstrates that the activity
of a susceptibility allele is context-specific whereas YY1, such as Sp1, Sp3, P15 and
DEAF-1, is a trans-acting factor that can modulate <italic>GDF5</italic> expression and
which could therefore be exploited to potentially alleviate the OA risk coded for by this
gene.</p><p>In their C-allele forms rs143383 and rs143384 create CpG sites. Such sites are potentially
amenable to epigenetic regulation by DNA methylation. Since epigenetic mechanisms are known
to play a role in chondrogenesis and OA pathogenesis (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>) it was hypothesised that rs143383
and rs143384 may be targets for epigenetic control and that was indeed shown to be the case
(Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>). Methylation of the <italic>GDF5</italic>
5&#x02032;UTR was demonstrated to occur in cell lines and in joint tissues, with demethylation
leading to increased <italic>GDF5</italic> expression. In a cell line heterozygous for
rs143383, this demethylation was found to exacerbate the AEI mediated by rs143383. This
result clearly demonstrated that the genetic effect that rs143383 has on
<italic>GDF5</italic> expression is modifiable by nongenetic factors.</p><p>There are as yet no animal models directly targeting the <italic>GDF5</italic> SNPs
discussed above. However, the brachypodism mouse has offered an opportunity to assess what
effect a reduction in GDF5 has on joint physiology. The brachypodism mutation is a frame
shift of <italic>Gdf5</italic> that causes a premature termination codon, resulting in a
null allele. Homozygotes display a number of musculoskeletal defects whereas heterozygotes
show no such developmental abnormalities but are at risk of developing an OA phenotype when
challenged (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>). By being subjected to a
reduction rather than a total loss of <italic>GDF5</italic> the brachypodism heterozygote
mimics the effect of rs143383 in human OA and emphasises the need to maintain appropriate
levels of GDF5 to ensure healthy joint function.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Functional studies on other OA susceptibility loci</title><p>There have been published reports on the functional analysis of other OA loci, with
particularly insightful data generated recently for the 7q22 signal from the Rotterdam study
and for <italic>DIO2</italic>.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the Rotterdam study reported an association signal to a region of
chromosome 7q22 encompassing six known protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab03">Table 3</xref>). The expression of these genes was assessed using cells
extracted and cultured from the joint tissues of OA patients. Expression was also
investigated in mouse joint tissues and in zebrafish embryos. The results revealed that all
the genes showed a near universal expression pattern, apart from <italic>GPR22</italic>
(Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). A subsequent study that examined the expression of the genes using RNA directly
extracted from patient joint tissues discovered that genotype at the 7q22 association signal
correlated with expression of <italic>HBP1</italic> in cartilage (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>). It would appear likely therefore that part, or all, of the 7q22
association signal is accounted for by a regulatory polymorphism that modulates
<italic>HBP1</italic> expression.</p><p><italic>DIO2</italic> codes for iodothyronine-deiodinase enzyme type 2 (D2), a
selenoprotein that converts intracellular inactive thyroid hormone to its active form. A
common <italic>DIO2</italic> haplotype composed of the C-allele of SNP rs225014 and the
C-allele of SNP rs12885300 is associated with OA in Europeans and Asians (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab01">Table 1</xref>).
An analysis of <italic>DIO2</italic> expression revealed that the gene was subject to AEI
with the C-allele of rs225014 correlating with increased expression in cartilage (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>). Furthermore, immunohistochemistry revealed an
increased amount of D2 positive cells in OA versus healthy cartilage. These results suggest
that modulating the level of active thyroid hormone in joint tissues, via the increased
expression of <italic>DIO2</italic> and the subsequent availability of D2, is a contributing
factor in OA aetiology. Methylation analysis of CpG sites within and close to
<italic>DIO2</italic> in both OA diseased cartilage and intact cartilage have revealed that,
as for <italic>GDF5</italic>, the gene is also subjected to epigenetic regulation related to
disease status (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>).</p><p><italic>GDF5</italic>, <italic>HBP1</italic> and <italic>DIO2</italic> are all examples of
where the OA risk allele mediates its effect by altering gene expression. As more
susceptibility loci are identified for common human diseases it is becoming apparent that
the majority of associated alleles contribute to disease risk by influencing gene
expression, typically by modulating rates of transcription or of transcript stability (Ref.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>). OA genetic susceptibility is following this
trend and as such the initial functional test on all new OA signals should be an assessment
of the effect that the risk allele has on gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Clinical implications and applications</title><p>One of the early translational aims of the genetic investigation of common complex diseases
was that it would offer a predictive capacity to clinicians in their attempts to identify
individuals at risk of disease initiation and progression. However, it has become apparent
that the vast majority of disease risk alleles contribute individually only very modestly to
heritability and as such there is limited current scope for their use as predictive tools
(Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>). Clearly, this scenario is likely to
change as more risk alleles are identified (see below) but for the vast majority of diseases
this is realistically a medium term goal at best. Alternatively, by identifying the
principal pathways that are the recipients of genetic susceptibility then there is scope for
exploiting these insights for new treatment development. As yet the number of OA risk loci
is quite small but it does appear from the list of genes in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab01">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab03">3</xref> that
regulation of cell differentiation could be one of the key pathways for future
exploitation.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Research in progress and outstanding research questions</title><p>One of the clear messages to have emerged from the GWASs performed on common diseases is
that the case-control sample sizes used have to be large in order to detect what are small
individual contributions from the risk alleles. Of the three GWASs listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab02">Table 2</xref> only arcOGEN had adequate sample size to
identify multiple genome-wide significant signals. If additional novel OA signals are to be
discovered, it is critical that genotyping at the genome-wide level continues on all
available samples and with the concurrent use of meta-analyses. The number of OA cases will
also need to be expanded to provide the power to account for susceptibility differences
between ethnic groups, between the two sexes and between different joints; without case
sample sizes in the tens of thousands the vast majority of OA susceptibility alleles will go
undetected. It has also become evident that rare variants can also contribute to common
disease risk (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>) and that these are often not captured by the current GWAS arrays.
As such imputation, re-sequencing and exome and whole-genome analyses (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>) are likely to have a role in the discovery of rare
risk alleles for OA.</p><p>OA genetic studies have quite sensibly focused on clinical forms of the disease but it is
becoming apparent that breakthroughs can also be achieved by studying alternative but
related phenotypes and a very clear example of this has recently been published. The
Rotterdam group who discovered the 7q22 locus subsequently examined joint-space width (JSW)
at the hip in their population cohorts (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>).
JSW is a proxy for cartilage thickness, with a narrowing indicating thinner cartilage. A
GWAS was performed and an association was detected with SNP rs12982744, with a
<italic>P</italic>-value of 1.1&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>&#x02212;11</sup>. The G-allele of the SNP was associated
with an increase in JSW and a secondary analysis revealed that this allele also correlated
with a reduced risk of hip OA. The <italic>P</italic>-value for the OA association was more
modest than that for JSW, at 1.0&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>, but the principle was clearly
established that the use of a proxy phenotype can further our understanding of OA.
rs12982744 resides within <italic>DOT1L</italic>, which codes for the enzyme histone-lysine
<italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase, H3 lysine-79 specific. As the name implies, this
enzyme is a histone methyltransferase that methylates lysine-79 of histone H3. Using the
mouse ATDC5 chondrogenesis model and micromass cultures the investigators demonstrated that
knockdown of <italic>Dot1l</italic> leads to reduced proteoglycan and collagen content and
that this may be mediated by modulation of the wnt signalling pathway. The investigators
also demonstrated expression of the gene during mouse limb development.</p><p>Pain is a symptom of clinical OA and has been considered a logical therapeutic target for
OA treatment. However, the current clinical trial data on the use of targeted pain biologics
have revealed that adverse events can outweigh any benefits of managing OA pain (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>). Nevertheless, there have been several reports
testing for genetic association between known pain loci and OA pain, including to the genes
<italic>P2RX7</italic>, <italic>PACE4</italic> and <italic>TRPV1</italic> (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref>). In comparison with the OA GWAS studies discussed
above, the significant <italic>P</italic>-values obtained were relatively modest. Despite
this, these studies do support a more comprehensive and powered analysis of the genetics of
OA pain.</p><p>Gene expression microarray analyses provide an opportunity to assess which particular
pathways are implicated in disease initiation and progression, or in the establishment of a
particular cell type. As such they have enhanced our understanding of OA pathogenesis and
<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab05">Table 5</xref> provides details of six such recent
studies including a summary of their key findings (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref>). One clear conclusion is that
gene expression varies qualitatively and quantitatively between cartilage collected from
different skeletal sites, such as the knees and the hips (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref>). This is reminiscent
of the genetic discovery discussed earlier of OA risk alleles rarely being systemic in their
effects and often showing joint-specific effects. The microarrays have also highlighted
genes that show significant up- or down-regulation in OA and several of the genes from
within the arcOGEN signals are among these, including <italic>COL12A1</italic>,
<italic>MYO6</italic>, <italic>CHST11</italic> and <italic>PAPPA</italic>. In the future,
RNA sequencing (RNAseq) will supersede microarrays, as it offers a number of advantages
including the ability to discover novel transcripts and alternative splice forms (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref>). A
natural progression from gene expression is proteomic analysis but this is only now
receiving the detailed and comprehensive attention that it deserves. Investigators have, for
example, characterised the protein profiles in the joint tissues and fluids of OA patients
and then compared these with the profiles from healthy groups and from patients with a
different joint disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref64">64</xref>). Cartilages from
different anatomical sites have also been compared (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref65">65</xref>). The aim has been to enlighten our understanding of the pathophysiology of the
disease and to assist in the identity of biomarkers that may be used to assess disease
status and disease progression (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref66">66</xref>). It is
clear from these studies that there are significant differences between the OA and the
non-OA proteome profiles and that some of the protein differences are detectable in
accessible fluids such as urine, which makes their use in future clinical trials of OA
therapeutics a realistic possibility. <table-wrap id="tab05" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 5.</label><caption><p>Recent global gene-expression microarray studies relevant to human osteoarthritis

expression irrespective of genotype and as a modulator of genetic risk (Refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>). Much more work, however, needs to be performed
before we get even a vague understanding of the actual impact of epigenetics on the disease.
Careful decisions will have to be made between which tissues to analyse and although
cartilage is an obvious priority tissue, it is clear that all joint tissues have to be
considered. The developmental time points studied will also be critical since epigenetic
events are likely to be temporally regulated. The type of epigenetic mark is also an issue,
with DNA CpG methylation and microRNAs amenable to relatively high-throughput analyses
whereas histone modifications currently are not.</p><p>Ultimately the goal of all such genetic, transcriptomic and epigenetic datasets will be
their integration to identify the regulatory pathways and networks that are definitive of
and causal to the disease (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref67">67</xref>). At that point
we may be in a position to use our genetic insights for informed development of new
biological treatments for OA.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements and funding</title><p>We are grateful to Arthritis Research UK, the National Institute for Health Research, the
