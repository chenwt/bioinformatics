Early during female development, each cell of the embryo proper independently inactivates one of its two parental X-chromosomes. In mice, the choice of which X chromosome is inactivated is affected by the genotype of a <italic>cis</italic>-acting locus, the <italic>X-chromosome controlling element</italic> (<italic>Xce</italic>). <italic>Xce</italic> has been localized to a 1.9 Mb interval within the X-inactivation center (<italic>Xic</italic>), yet its molecular identity and mechanism of action remain unknown. We combined genotype and sequence data for mouse stocks with detailed phenotyping of ten inbred strains and with the development of a statistical model that incorporates phenotyping data from multiple sources to disentangle sources of XCI phenotypic variance in natural female populations on X inactivation. We have reduced the <italic>Xce</italic> candidate 10-fold to a 176 kb region located approximately 500 kb proximal to <italic>Xist</italic>. We propose that structural variation in this interval explains the presence of multiple functional <italic>Xce</italic> alleles in the genus <italic>Mus</italic>. We have identified a new allele, <italic>Xce<sup>e</sup></italic> present in <italic>Mus musculus</italic> and a possible sixth functional allele in <italic>Mus spicilegus</italic>. We have also confirmed a parent-of-origin effect on X inactivation choice and provide evidence that maternal inheritance magnifies the skewing associated with strong <italic>Xce</italic> alleles. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of 155 laboratory strains and wild mice we conclude that <italic>Xce<sup>a</sup></italic> is either a derived allele that arose concurrently with the domestication of fancy mice but prior the derivation of most classical inbred strains or a rare allele in the wild. Furthermore, we have found that despite the presence of multiple haplotypes in the wild <italic>Mus musculus domesticus</italic> has only one functional <italic>Xce</italic> allele, <italic>Xce<sup>b</sup></italic>. Lastly, we conclude that each mouse taxa examined has a different functional <italic>Xce</italic> allele.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Although mammalian females have two X chromosomes in each cell, only one is functional, while gene expression from the other is silenced through a process called X chromosome inactivation. Little is known about the early stages of this process including how one parental X chromosome is inactivated over the other on a cell-by-cell basis. It has been shown, however, that certain inbred mouse strains are functionally different at a locus that controls this choice that provides an opportunity to identify the locus and determine its molecular mechanism. This has been the goal of many researchers over the past 40 years with incremental success. Here we took advantage of new mouse genotype and whole genome sequencing data to pinpoint the locus controlling choice. Our results identified a smaller region on the X chromosome that contains large duplicated sequences. We propose an explanation for multiple functional alleles in mouse and provide insight into the possible molecular mechanism of X chromosome inactivation choice. Our evolutionary analysis reveals why functional diversity at this locus appears to be common in laboratory mice and offers an explanation as to why we do not see this level of diversity in humans.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This project was supported in part by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant MH-090338 and HG-006582 (FPMdV).

This is a consequence of the mammalian dosage compensation mechanism called X chromosome inactivation (XCI) that balances X-linked gene expression between the sexes <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Lyon1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The choice of which X chromosome undergoes XCI occurs early during female embryogenesis on a small population of epiblast cells within the embryo proper <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Epstein1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Monk1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Monk2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Takagi1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. By an unknown mechanism, each cell randomly chooses to inactivate one of the two parental X-chromosomes and then commits to that choice by initiating a cascade of transcriptional and epigenetic regulation that modifies both chromosomes to distinguish the future inactive X from the active X <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Brockdorff1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Gilbert1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Heard1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Jeppesen1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Riggs1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Sharp1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Ultimately, the inactive X chromosome becomes physically condensed and sequestered within the nucleus rendering it almost completely nonfunctional <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Barr1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Ohno1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Ohno2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The initial choice each epiblast cell makes is preserved and transmitted mitotically to all its daughter cells <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Krietsch1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. As a result, each female is a unique mosaic of somatic cells that express either the maternally or paternally derived X chromosome. The degree of mosaicism (overall ratio and spatial distribution of cells) is determined by the initial number of cells that undergo independent choice, by the developmental fate of each epiblast cell and its multiplication rate.</p><p>A role for genetics in XCI choice was initially discovered by skewed XCI ratios in female hybrids between certain stocks derived from classical inbred mouse strains. These female hybrids, on average, preferentially inactivated one X chromosome over the other in a strain dependent manner <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Cattanach1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Cattanach2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The effect was later mapped to a single location on the X chromosome and given the name <italic>X-chromosome controlling element</italic> (<italic>Xce</italic>) for its role in XCI choice <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Cattanach3" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Since its initial discovery, four functional alleles of <italic>Xce</italic> have been characterized in <italic>Mus</italic> inbred strains, (<italic>Xce<sup>a</sup></italic>, <italic>Xce<sup>b</sup></italic>, <italic>Xce<sup>c</sup></italic> and <italic>Xce<sup>d</sup></italic>) and are distinguished by their relative resistance or susceptibility to inactivation <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Cattanach2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Cattanach4" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Cattanach5" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Cattanach6" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Cattanach7" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1003853-Forrester1" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1003853-Fowlis1" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. The four <italic>Xce</italic> alleles form an allelic series of XCI skewing, the magnitude and direction of which depends on the <italic>Xce</italic> genotype of the female. Furthermore, XCI skewing is only observed in <italic>Xce</italic> heterozygotes while female homozygotes display no preference towards inactivating either parental X chromosome <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Krietsch2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The order of known <italic>Xce</italic> allele strength is <italic>Xce<sup>a</sup> &#x0003c; Xce<sup>b</sup> &#x0003c; Xce<sup>c</sup></italic> &#x0003c; <italic>Xce<sup>d</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003853-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In other words, in female heterozygotes the X chromosome carrying the stronger <italic>Xce</italic> allele has a higher probability of remaining active and thus, these females will have a larger number of cells with that X chromosome active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003853-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). From a genetic standpoint, alleles at <italic>Xce</italic> are overdominant and therefore <italic>Xce</italic> acts in <italic>cis</italic>.</p><fig id="pgen-1003853-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1003853.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The <italic>Xce</italic> allelic series.</title><p>Panel A shows the order of <italic>Xce</italic> allele strength.

<italic>Xce</italic> has been mapped within a 1.85 Mb candidate interval that overlaps with the current definition of the <italic>X inactivation center</italic> (<italic>Xic</italic>) which includes three long non-coding RNAs <italic>Xist</italic>, <italic>Tsix</italic> and <italic>Xite</italic> that play major roles in murine XCI <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Chadwick1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. It has been postulated that the <italic>Xce</italic> allelic series can be explained by genetic variation within these long non-coding RNAs, specifically <italic>Xite</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003853-Ogawa1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. An alternative hypothesis is that XCI choice is controlled by X-linked and autosomal dosage factors <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Monkhorst1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Russell1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and thus <italic>Xce</italic> would serve as a binding site for a <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor(s) that influences <italic>Tsix</italic> or <italic>Xist</italic> expression <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Russell1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Percec1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Percec2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Nonetheless, the identity of <italic>Xce</italic> remains unknown. This is in part due to the technical challenges of measuring XCI choice and to the relatively high level of stochastic variation in XCI in isogenic female populations that together make it difficult to infer with certainty the <italic>Xce</italic> allele present in an individual female (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003853-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Mapping <italic>Xce</italic> is further complicated by the comparatively low recombination rate of the X chromosome and the fact that only females are informative for the phenotype.</p><p>Although <italic>Xce</italic> is the major locus controlling XCI choice, previous studies have demonstrated that parent-of-origin and autosomal factors significantly influence XCI choice <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Forrester1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Fowlis1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Bittner1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Chadwick2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Plenge1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. A large mapping experiment identified suggestive loci on five autosomes but none reached genome&#x02013;wide significance <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Chadwick1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The parent-of-origin effect was first described by Forrester and Ansell in 1985 as a difference in XCI skewing depending on whether the <italic>Xce<sup>c</sup></italic> allele was maternally or paternally inherited in <italic>Xce<sup>c/b</sup></italic> heterozygotes. The evidence available at the time, however, could not discriminate among <italic>Xce</italic>, another X-linked locus or autosomal loci. A more recent study provided additional evidence of a parent-of-origin effect and postulated that its cause could be <italic>Xce</italic> itself or epigenetic differences of one or more X-linked loci <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Chadwick2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The same study showed an increased variance in XCI skewing in F2 females heterozygous for the same combination of <italic>Xce</italic> alleles as F1 hybrids, indicating the existence of autosomal factors that influence XCI choice <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Chadwick2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. A more recent study used mouse lines with recombinant X chromosomes derived from two genetically divergent mouse inbred strains (129S1/SvlmJ and CAST/EiJ) to show that multiple regions along the X chromosome influence XCI choice, but was unable to map any of them, including <italic>Xce</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003853-Thorvaldsen1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Lastly, there are well-documented cases of secondary XCI skewing that influence the XCI patterns observed in adults <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Kristiansen1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Puck1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Vickers1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Secondary skewing occurs when an X linked mutation impacts cell survival or proliferation.</p><p>Technical issues associated with measuring XCI choice further complicate the identification of <italic>Xce</italic>. A well-established surrogate for XCI choice is X-linked allele-specific gene expression. Nonetheless, gene expression in a female mouse can be influenced by many factors in addition to XCI choice itself. And thus, it is important to carefully choose X-linked genes that most accurately reflect the true ratio of XCI while minimizing the presence of misleading factors such as differential expression due to <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory variants, tissue-specific skewing, or XCI escape. As a general rule, estimation of XCI skewing improves with the number of X-linked genes used.</p><p>In this study, we developed an approach that overcomes major challenges of mapping <italic>Xce</italic>. Our approach is based on association mapping of XCI skewing phenotypes in classical inbred strains that have recently been genotyped at very high density <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> or had their genome sequenced (whole genome sequence, WGS) <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Keane1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Our analysis was restricted to the previously defined candidate interval <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Chadwick1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and generated a new candidate interval of much smaller size. By generating multiple F1 hybrid females between inbred strains we accurately determined the mean and the variance in XCI ratio within genetically identical mice. We also generated reciprocal crosses to determine the parent-of-origin effects. Lastly, we performed these analyses in multiple tissues and thus determined whether tissue choice had an effect on the estimation of skewing of XCI. In order to analyze the X-linked expression phenotype data we developed a hierarchical Bayesian model and inference procedure that allows to us to estimate both the mean and the variability of XCI within an individual female or female population. We extended our phenotyping to wild-derived inbred strains with different haplotypes of known subspecific origin <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, and used these data to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the <italic>Xce</italic> locus itself.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Association mapping based on public data narrows the <italic>Xce</italic> candidate interval to 194 kb</title><p>In our initial approach to reduce the candidate interval we first identified a subset of inbred mouse strains that had both a known <italic>Xce</italic> allele and high-density genotype <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> or sequence data <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Keane1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> available. Over the past four decades, several inbred mouse strains have been phenotyped for XCI skewing and these strains include representatives of each one of the four known <italic>Xce</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003853-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). At the <italic>Xce</italic> candidate interval defined by Chadwick and coworkers (2006), referred hereafter as the Chadwick interval, these strains have haplotypes derived from two different <italic>Mus</italic> species, <italic>Mus spretus</italic> and <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, and two subspecies of the latter, <italic>M. m. castaneus</italic> and <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003853-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Two strains, CAST/EiJ and SPRET/EiJ, cannot be used to refine the candidate interval using single locus association mapping techniques because they are singletons for both an <italic>Xce</italic> allele and the specific or subspecific origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003853-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The remaining 25 strains are almost evenly distributed between <italic>Xce<sup>a</sup></italic> and <italic>Xce<sup>b</sup></italic> carriers and all have a <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> haplotype in the candidate interval <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Furthermore, all of them are classical inbred strains descended from a small pool of founders <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Didion1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> which makes extremely unlikely the possibility that one or more recurring mutations that exactly generate either the <italic>Xce<sup>a</sup></italic> or the <italic>Xce<sup>b</sup></italic> allele arose multiple times independently. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that <italic>Xce<sup>a</sup></italic> and <italic>Xce<sup>b</sup></italic> alleles are inherited from a recent common ancestor rather than spontaneously arising over multiple times within this complex multifamily pedigree.

Briefly, our model parameterizes gene-tissue bias and precision, parent-of-origin effects, and genetic background effects (strain) to account for gross sources of uncertainty and error associated with our XCI phenotyping method. This allows us to combine the different gene measurements and tissues from individual females and establish a mean XCI ratio (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) for a given cross.</p><p>For each F1 cross, we tested whether the two parental strains carry the same <italic>Xce</italic> allele. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003853-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows the gene expression data (panel A) and posterior mean and confidence intervals inferred from it (Panel B) for the SJL/J F1 crosses performed. The posteriors in Panel B estimate the mean inactivation proportion associated with each cross. They show where and how posterior probability for the underlying cross mean is concentrated on the scale of 0 (representing full maternal inactivation) to 1 (representing full paternal inactivation), with 0.5 indicating a cross average of about 50% paternal and maternal X-inactivation. By choosing regions of 95% posterior coverage, we see that the data allows us to measure mean X inactivation proportions accurately within 7.7% (+/&#x02212;5%), placing for instance, the (SJL/JxCAST/EiJ)F1 firmly to the left of 50%, around 33.6% of cells with an active SJL/J X chromosome.

The need to fulfill the second assumption, that each allele arose once, guided the decision to restrict our initial association mapping analysis to classical inbred strains only, since the probability of multiple recurring mutations are extremely low based on their history <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Keane1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>.

In fact, <italic>Xce</italic> is a particularly difficult test case because of complexity of the XCI process and the reduced recombination rate on the X chromosome.</p><p>We tailored our experimental design to anticipate the challenges of phenotyping mouse strains with unknown <italic>Xce</italic> alleles. First, the functional allele in a strain with an unknown <italic>Xce</italic> allele can be determined only by generating heterozygous females with known <italic>Xce</italic> alleles and then determining the ratio of XCI in the heterozygous progeny. The precision in identifying the unknown allele increases with the number of different alleles to which it is paired in the experimental F1 hybrids. We, therefore, crossed each strain with an unknown <italic>Xce</italic> allele to at least two strains with known and different <italic>Xce</italic> alleles.</p><p>To estimate mean XCI skewing accurately, we phenotyped multiple females per cross. Moreover, for most females, we measured XCI skewing in at least three different tissues that roughly represent the three germ layers, brain (ectoderm), liver (endoderm) and kidney (mesoderm). Our results confirm previous reports that mean XCI skewing is similar between different tissues <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Krietsch2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Plenge1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Johnston1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Nesbitt1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. We do, however, observe differences in the variance of XCI skewing between different tissues (brain &#x000b1;6% kidney &#x000b1;7.5%, and liver &#x000b1;8.2%). From a practical standpoint, whole brain had the smallest variance and thus would require fewer animals to accurately determine mean XCI skewing.</p><p>It is appropriate to use gene expression to measure the proportion of cells using the maternal <italic>versus</italic> paternal X chromosomes. However, expression at single genes can be misleading because of measurement bias or allelic imbalance independent of XCI choice such as <italic>cis-</italic>acting regulatory variants or XCI escape. To mitigate these potential issues, we measured multiple X-linked genes using pyrosequencing and/or RNAseq. By combining multiple gene measurements, we can better estimate the mean XCI skewing. Both technologies simultaneously measure maternal and paternal expression, reducing the concern of parent-specific measurement bias.</p><p>Despite our thoroughness, we could not conclusively assign an <italic>Xce</italic> allele to the WLA/Pas strain, although we can exclude both <italic>Xce<sup>c</sup></italic> and <italic>Xce<sup>d</sup></italic>. A possible reason for this is that in all crosses involving WLA/Pas the <italic>Xce<sup>WLA/Pas</sup></italic> allele was inherited through the paternal germline and in the absence of reciprocal crosses the parent-of-origin can potentially complicate <italic>Xce</italic> allele calling. A second, and more interesting explanation is that WLA/Pas has a <italic>b4</italic> haplotype that appears to be <italic>a/b1</italic> recombinant whose breakpoints fall within the SD4 in the candidate interval (see below and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003853-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Although only a small number of readily available mouse strains carry <italic>M. m. castaneus</italic> or <italic>M. m. musculus</italic> haplotypes, a previous study measured XCI skewing in reciprocal F1 hybrids between PWD/PhJ and AKR/J <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. This study reported that PWD/PhJ has an <italic>Xce</italic> allele that is weaker than <italic>Xce<sup>b</sup></italic>. This result matches our conclusion that PWK/PhJ, a closely related wild-derived inbred strain <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, carries the <italic>Xce<sup>e</sup></italic> allele. Furthermore, we conclude that <italic>M. m. musculus</italic> do not carry the <italic>Xce<sup>c</sup></italic> allele as reported in a congenic mouse line believed to be of <italic>M. m. musculus</italic> origin within the <italic>Xce</italic> candidate interval <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Johnston1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>.</p><p>Our conclusion that the structural variants in the duplications within the candidate interval are likely to be responsible for the different <italic>Xce</italic> alleles provides simple and satisfactory answers to questions such as the presence of the allelic series, the overdominant nature and mechanism of action of <italic>Xce</italic>, and the evolutionary origin of the interspecific differences for XCI choice. Copy number variation within a region with complex segmental duplications and inversions can explain the large number (six alleles described so far in <italic>Mus</italic>) and different strength of the alleles at <italic>Xce</italic>. For example, the different strength of <italic>Xce</italic> alleles can be attributed to the number of copies of a binding site for a transfactor that is critical for the initiation of XCI <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Monkhorst1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Russell1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Percec1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Percec2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p><p>One of the conclusions of our study is that each one of the five taxa (species or major subspecies) analyzed for XCI choice in <italic>Mus</italic> has a different functional allele and that there is no evidence of shared alleles between them. The rate of mutation for CNV at segmental duplicated regions fits well with the observed functional diversity at <italic>Xce</italic>. Given that unequal recombination is thought to be the primary process generating CNVs, it is noteworthy that two of the haplotypes reported here (<italic>b3</italic> and <italic>b4</italic>) involve crossing over within the duplications. In fact, we observe an apparently correct heterozygous call at SNP rs29082017 in two males with the <italic>b3</italic> haplotype. Given that males cannot be true heterozygotes for X linked markers, the result strongly suggests that an unequal crossing over has generated a new haplotype with paralogous variation. Resequencing the candidate interval in these strains should provide important information on the relationship between CNVs and functional <italic>Xce</italic> alleles.</p><p>It is striking that each species and subspecies examined thus far has a different functional allele. Furthermore, in the six wild-derived <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> mouse strains phenotyped in this study, we do not find the occurrence of multiple functional alleles. We conclude that in <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic>, <italic>Xce<sup>b</sup></italic> is the prevalent allele and other functional alleles are either rare or absent. The broad geographic origin of the wild-derived strains analyzed here strongly support this conclusion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003853.s010">Table S6</xref>). The only apparent exception to this rule is the presence of two functional alleles in classical inbred strains, <italic>Xce<sup>a</sup></italic> and <italic>Xce<sup>b</sup></italic>. That said, it is likely that <italic>Xce<sup>b</sup></italic> is the ancestral allele within the <italic>domesticus</italic> subspecies and <italic>Xce<sup>a</sup></italic> is a new, derived allele that originated early during the domestication of fancy mice. However, the phylogenetic tree shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003853-g005">Figure 5B</xref> reveals deep branching between <italic>Xce<sup>a</sup></italic> and <italic>Xce<sup>b</sup></italic> haplotypes that at first glance suggests that both are old alleles. Upon further investigation, there is evidence that the deep branching observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003853-g005">Figure 5B</xref> may be an artifact generated by genotyping and alignment problems in regions with segmental duplications (i.e., the apparent SNP are paralogous variants rather that allelic ones). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003853.s004">Figure S4</xref> provides evidence in favor of this later scenario as the deep branching disappears immediately proximal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003853.s004">Figure S4A</xref>) and distal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003853.s004">Figure S4C</xref>) to the duplicated regions. Furthermore, there is a dramatic increase in the density of heterozygous calls in the WGS data for inbred strains that overlaps the region of segmental duplications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003853.s004">Figure S4D</xref>).</p><p>The phylogenetic analysis also provides an explanation for the apparent differences in the genetics of XCI choice between mouse and humans. Mouse geneticists were able to find evidence of genetic control of XCI because they used mice derived from multiple taxa and because <italic>Xce<sup>a</sup></italic> and <italic>Xce<sup>b</sup></italic> are equally represented among classical laboratory inbred strains. In fact, were we to have studied only wild-derived or wild mice of <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> origin, we would very likely have concluded that XCI choice is not under the control of a X chromosome linked locus. We speculate that this is probably the situation in humans too, but note that this conclusion would be due to a lack of functional variation at the <italic>Xce</italic> locus and not proof of the absence of a locus controlling XCI choice.</p><p>We conclude that <italic>Xce</italic> is the major determinant of primary XCI choice and maps 500 kb proximal to key components of the murine <italic>Xic</italic> (<italic>Xist</italic>, <italic>Tsix</italic> and <italic>Xite</italic>). Our results are compatible with the general conclusions reached by Thorvaldenson and coworkers (2012). Nonetheless a direct comparison of both studies is difficult. Thorvenson and colleagues (2012) used only two functional alleles, <italic>Xce<sup>a</sup></italic> and <italic>Xce<sup>c</sup></italic> from highly divergent mouse strains to map roughly X-linked regions influencing XCI choice. They found that all their crosses, regardless of heterozygosity within the Chadwick interval, there is some degree of skewing in favor of the 129S1/SvlmJ and CAST/EiJ recombinant chromosome X. This led to the conclusion that multiple X-linked loci influence XCI choice. Although we provide strong evidence that the <italic>Xce</italic> allelic series is due to structural variation in the <italic>Xce</italic> candidate interval, we cannot exclude that a selected few SNPs within the Chadwick interval may also contribute to XCI choice. There are 14 SNPs distal to the <italic>Xce</italic> interval reported here with consistent SDPs in <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> after the incorporation of the four strains with <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> phenotyped. None of these SNPs individually can explain the allelic series and no simple combination of them within a single gene can be directly tied to the phenotype. On the other hand our reciprocal crosses between ALS/LtJ and C57BL/6J agree with Thorvenson's hypothesis that additional loci may have an effect in XCI choice as we find that the parent-of-origin effect is present despite homozygosity at the <italic>Xce</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003853.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Both studies strongly predict the presence of an additional X-linked locus (or loci) controlling the parent-of-origin effect.</p><p>The genetic analysis of the <italic>Xce</italic> locus presented in this study sets the stage for the molecular characterization of <italic>Xce</italic>. However, the most direct experiments will require access to the cells and biological material of the critical window at which XCI choice is made either by <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>ex vivo</italic> using ES cell lines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mouse breeding and tissue isolation</title><p>Mice from nine inbred strains (129S1/SvlmJ, A/J, ALS/LtJ, C57BL/6J, CAST/EiJ, LEWES/EiJ, PWK/EiJ, SJL/J, and WSB/EiJ,) were originally obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME).

Purified, single-stranded amplicons were primed for pyrosequencing using gene-specific primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003853.s011">Table S7</xref>) and pyrosequenced using the PyroMark Q96 MD instrument (Qiagen) and PyroMark Gold Q96 Reagents (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's protocols. Allelic proportions were determined by the quantitative analysis option of the PyroMark Q96 MD Software.

Briefly, we generated cDNA libraries (Illumina (San Diego, CA) TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit v2) from whole brain mRNA of female reciprocal F1 hybrids between CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ. Using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument, we sequenced 100 bp paired end reads (2&#x000d7;100). For each F1 hybrid, we mapped 100 bp paired-end RNAseq reads to pseudogenomes of each parent (CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ and WSB/EiJ) using TopHat. Pseudogenomes are approximations of CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ and WSB/EiJ strain genomes constructed by incorporating all known SNPs and indels into the C57BL/6 genome (mm9) <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Church1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. We allowed two mismatches total per 100 bp read. For each read, we annotated the number of maternal and paternal alleles (using SNPs and indels). XCI ratios were determined by counting the number of maternal reads versus the number of paternal reads. To measure XCI ratios, we selected 10 X-linked genes that are distributed across the X chromosome (<italic>Wdr13</italic>, <italic>Atp6ap2</italic>, <italic>Usp9x</italic>, <italic>Cask</italic>, <italic>Cd99l2</italic>, <italic>Idh3g</italic>, <italic>Dlg3</italic>, <italic>Zcchc18</italic>, <italic>Tsc22d3</italic>, <italic>Iqsec2</italic>). For each gene, we selected two informative SNPs between PWK, CAST, and WSB so that at least five of the ten genes were informative for a given F1 hybrid. For each informative SNP, we counted allele-specific reads to determine XCI ratios. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003853.s013">Table S9</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Statistical model for cross-specific X-inactivation ratios</title><p>Pyrosequencing and RNAseq provided estimates of the X-inactivation ratios obtaining for particular genes in specific tissues in particular individuals. In order to infer X-inactivation ratios pertaining to individual mice and to the crosses that generated them, we developed a hierarchical Bayesian model linking the observed experimental measurements to a structured set of higher order parameters. These parameters reflected not only the stochastic relationships between measurements, individuals and crosses, but also between different sources of experimental variation. Let <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.1003853.e001.jpg"/></inline-formula> be the measured X-inactivation proportion from pyrosequencing or RNAseq in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.1003853.e002.jpg"/></inline-formula>th gene-tissue combination of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.1003853.e003.jpg"/></inline-formula>th mouse, and let <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.1003853.e004.jpg"/></inline-formula> be the F1 cross to which mouse <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.1003853.e005.jpg"/></inline-formula> belongs, where for instance, crosses (129S1/SvlmJxPWK/PhJ)F1 and (PWK/PhJx129S1/SvlmJ)F1 are distinct. We first model a latent variable <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.1003853.e006.jpg"/></inline-formula> representing the X-inactivation proportion inherent to the individual mouse <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.1003853.e007.jpg"/></inline-formula> as if arising from a beta distribution<disp-formula id="pgen.1003853.e008"><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1003853.e008.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>with cross-specific mean governed by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.1003853.e009.jpg"/></inline-formula> and cross-specific variance proportional to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.1003853.e010.jpg"/></inline-formula>.

All higher order parameters are themselves modeled in loosely-specified grouped hierarchies based realistic but vague priors (as in, eg <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Congdon1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>). This hierarchical structure allows information and uncertainty to propagate within and between parameters, and results in improved estimation through shrinkage (see, eg, <xref rid="pgen.1003853-Parmigiani1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>). We obtain posterior distributions for all parameters, including those representing unobserved data, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Marginal posterior probability densities are computed for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.1003853.e018.jpg"/></inline-formula> parameters for crosses between mice with unknown <italic>Xce</italic> alleles using information from mice with known alleles. The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.1003853.e019.jpg"/></inline-formula> posterior density that includes the most support for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.1003853.e020.jpg"/></inline-formula> is taken as the most plausible candidate for having <italic>Xce</italic> allele shared by the unknown strain. In general, posteriors for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.1003853.e021.jpg"/></inline-formula> concentrated near 0.5 are more consistent with there being a shared allele between maternal and paternal pairs, whereas posterior densities shifted from 0.5 suggest that the <italic>Xce</italic> is different.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Significance test of parent-of-origin effects</title><p>The statistical significance of parent-of-origin effects was determined by permutation.
