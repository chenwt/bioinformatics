In the present study, we have utilized second- and third-generation-sequencing platforms, and have reported a draft genome of <italic>I. nil</italic> with a scaffold N50 of 2.88&#x02009;Mb (contig N50 of 1.87&#x02009;Mb), covering 98&#x00025; of the 750&#x02009;Mb genome. Scaffolds covering 91.42&#x00025; of the assembly are anchored to 15 pseudo-chromosomes. The draft genome has enabled the identification and cataloguing of the <italic>Tpn1</italic> family transposons, known as the major mutagen of <italic>I. nil</italic>, and analysing the dwarf gene, <italic>CONTRACTED</italic>, located on the genetic map published in 1956.

These species exhibit various flower morphologies and pigmentation patterns<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, and are distributed worldwide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Morning glory species, including <italic>Ipomoea nil, Ipomoea purpurea, Ipomoea tricolor</italic> and <italic>Ipomoea batatas</italic> (sweet potato), are commercially important species. Japanese morning glory (<italic>I. nil</italic>), locally known as Asagao, is a climbing annual herb producing blue flowers capable of self-pollination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a&#x02013;l</xref>). It is believed to have been introduced from China to Japan in the eighth century, and has become a traditional floricultural plant in Japan since the seventeenth century. Most of Japanese elementary students grow it, as part of their school curriculum. The genetics of <italic>I. nil</italic> has been extensively studied for more than 100 years, and it has been a model plant for the study of photoperiodic flowering and flower colouration. A number of spontaneous mutants of <italic>I. nil</italic> have been identified since the early nineteenth century. Most of their mutations were related to floricultural traits, and several variants with combinations of mutations have been developed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1m&#x02013;aa</xref>). The unique features of <italic>I. nil</italic>, for example, blue flowers and vine movements<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, have been characterized by using the cultivars carrying such mutations.</p><p>More than 1,500 cultivars of <italic>I. nil</italic> are maintained by the Stock Center at Kyushu University as a part of the National BioResource Project. Our recent studies have revealed that many of these mutant lines have been the result of mutagenic activity by <italic>Tpn1</italic> family transposons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. These transposons are class II elements and members of <italic>En/Spm</italic> or CACTA superfamily that can transpose via a cut-and-paste mechanism. The maize <italic>En/Spm</italic> elements encode two transposase genes for TnpA and TnpD, mediating transposition of <italic>En/Spm</italic> and its derivatives<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. TnpA and TnpD bind to the sub-terminal repetitive regions (SRRs) and terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) of <italic>En/Spm</italic>, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. The copy number of the <italic>Tpn1</italic> family was estimated to be 500&#x02013;1,000, and almost 40 copies have been characterized<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. All of the transposons characterized thus far are non-autonomous elements, and no elements encoding intact transposase genes have been identified. The non-autonomous <italic>Tpn1</italic> family elements have a characteristic structure and are known to capture genic regions from the host genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Their internal sequences are substituted with the captured host sequences, whereas their terminal regions necessary for transposition are conserved. Some of the internal genic regions are transcribed; a <italic>Tpn1</italic> transposon integrated in the <italic>DFR-B</italic> gene for anthocyanin pigment biosynthesis generates chimeric transcripts consisting of both the <italic>DFR-B</italic> and the captured intragenic region<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p><p><italic>I. nil</italic> has 15 pairs of chromosomes (2<italic>n</italic>=30)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. However, the original classical map from 1956 contained only ten linkage groups, as a result of mapping 71 genetic loci out of 219 analysed loci to one of the ten linkage groups<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. The genetic information of <italic>I. nil</italic> available to date includes the linkage map<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, 62,300 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) deposited to the DDBJ/EMBL/NCBI databases, simple sequence repeat markers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and a recent large-scale transcriptome assembly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. The availability of a reference genome sequence would give researchers a standard with which to compare their mutant lines and would fast track genomic analysis of mutations. The genome of a closely related species of a wild sweet potato, <italic>Ipomoea trifida</italic>, was recently sequenced and published<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, in which they reported genome sequences of two <italic>I. trifida</italic> lines analysed using Illumina HiSeq platform, with average scaffold lengths of 6.6&#x02009;kb (N50=43&#x02009;kb) and 3.9&#x02009;kb (N50=36&#x02009;kb), respectively. However, the assembled scaffolds did not have chromosomal level information, and were highly fragmented.</p><p>In the present study, we report a pseudo-chromosomal level whole genome assembly of a wild-type <italic>I. nil</italic> line, with an estimated genome size of 750&#x02009;Mb, sequenced using PacBio's Single Molecule, Real-Time Technology (SMRT) and Illumina sequencers. We have also identified two copies of <italic>Tpn1</italic> family transposons encoding putative TnpA and TnpD transposases, 339 other non-autonomous <italic>Tpn1</italic> transposon copies, as well as the most likely candidate for the dwarf gene, <italic>CONTRACTED</italic>, mapped on the classical genetic map.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>DNA sequencing and genome assembly</title><p>One individual plant of the wild-type line, Tokyo Kokei Standard (TKS), was used for genome sequencing. Its genome size was estimated to be approximately 750&#x02009;Mb using flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). PacBio sequencing yielded 5.74 million reads (39.4&#x02009;GB, 52.6 &#x000d7; coverage and N50 of 10.3&#x02009;kb), with the longest and the average read lengths being 48.1 and 6.8&#x02009;kb respectively, whereas, sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) included two short and six long insert libraries. With an initial read length of 150&#x02009;bp, the short reads covered approximately 906 &#x000d7; of the genome. The work-flow for the PacBio data assembly consisted of seven steps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Initial <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of the PacBio reads resulted in 736.4&#x02009;Mb of genome assembly, with a contig N50 of 1.83&#x02009;Mb. To remove left-over residual errors originating from PacBio sequences, the short reads from Illumina were aligned against the assembled genome to identify homozygous variants. The homozygous variants amounted to 1,532 SNPs, 20,479 deletions and 6,549 insertions showing that the assembly had 99.99&#x00025; base accuracy. The insertion-deletion (in-del) errors had outnumbered the substitution errors, similar to the results observed in PacBio-based <italic>Vigna angularis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> and <italic>Oropetium thomaeum</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> genome assemblies, and were replaced with the Illumina sequence bases. Mitochondrial and chloroplast derived sequences were identified to be 1.15&#x02009;Mb from 51 contigs and were removed. The organellar genomes were sequenced using a Sanger sequencer and assembled separately (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 4 and 5</xref>). Scaffolding using Illumina longer range mate-pair libraries and subsequent gap-filling using PacBio reads increased the N50 to 3.72&#x02009;Mb. The assembly statistics at each step of the work-flow are mentioned in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>. An independent assembly of Illumina reads using SOAPdenovo2 assembler<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> resulted in 1.1&#x02009;Gb of genome assembly. The assembly size was reduced to 768&#x02009;Mb, with a scaffold N50 of 3.5&#x02009;Mb and a contig N50 of 9.5&#x02009;kb, when considering only contigs and scaffolds longer than 1&#x02009;kb. The assembly statistics of both the PacBio and Illumina assemblies are compared in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>. The PacBio version of the assembly was chosen for downstream analysis owing to PacBio's longer read lengths vastly increasing the contiguity of the assembled genome.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mis-assembly detection and pseudo-molecule construction</title><p>Illumina sequencing employing the RAD-seq<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> procedure, yielded 86.1 million reads for the parent samples and 562.2 million reads for the progeny samples (read length of 150&#x02009;bp). Filtering the SNP markers obtained using the STACKS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> pipeline resulted in 3,733 SNP markers from 176 samples. Fifteen linkage maps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>) were constructed using the SNP markers and were helpful in identifying inconsistent scaffolds which were present in more than one linkage group. To eliminate the possibility of mis-assembled chimeric scaffolds, the scaffolds were split at their junction points into two separate scaffolds using the linkage maps as a reference. In the case of mis-assemblies at the contig level, each chimeric region was split into three parts such that the first and the last part would belong to two different chromosomes from the linkage map, whereas the middle part would still remain chimeric, albeit with a shorter length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). A first splitting procedure was employed to split 52 scaffolds, after the scaffolding phase of the assembly process. After gap-filling, another splitting procedure was used to break 29 additional scaffolds. The major achievement of the assembly procedure was that, even after splitting chimeric scaffolds, the N50 values obtained for scaffolds and contigs were still 2.88 and 1.87&#x02009;Mb (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>), respectively, which is comparable to assemblies achieved utilizing traditional Sanger sequencing data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. The mapping of scaffolds to linkage maps not only aided in identifying potential mis-assemblies, but also guided the generation of pseudo-chromosomes from the available scaffolds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). The pseudo-chromosomes accounted for 91.42&#x00025; of the assembly (N50 of 44.78&#x02009;Mb), along with unoriented scaffolds (around 25.53&#x00025; of the assembly), and are represented in a circular display, with predicted genomic features along the 15 pseudo-chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a&#x02013;f</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Assembly validation</title><p>The Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach, or CEGMA pipeline<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> and more recently, the BUSCO<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> pipeline have become commonly used protocols to validate the completeness of assembly projects by examination of coverage of highly conserved genes. The percentage of completeness for our assembly was 94.35 and 99.60&#x00025; for completely and partially aligned core eukaryotic genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). BUSCO analysis revealed a completeness score of around 95&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). This indicated that most of the evolutionarily conserved core gene set was present in the <italic>I. nil</italic> assembly suggesting a high quality assembly. To further validate the assembly, the newly generated <italic>I. nil</italic> ESTs, BAC-end and RNA-seq data were utilized. Comparisons against 93,691 ESTs showed that 99.11&#x00025; of them were aligned, with 97.40&#x00025; of the ESTs having at least 90&#x00025; of their lengths covered in the alignments. Using 20,847 BAC-end read pairs, it was found that 94.92&#x00025; of the reads were paired in the same scaffold with a mean insert length near the 100&#x02009;kb mark (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>), and 97.87&#x00025; of the reads were paired in the same pseudo-chromosome. RNA-seq reads from six different tissues including leaf, flower, embryo, stem, root and seed coat tissues, when aligned against the assembled sequence, showed that around 94.7 and 96&#x00025; of the read pairs were aligned in the embryo sample and the remaining five samples, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). The high quality of the assembly verified by CEGMA and BUSCO was corroborated by the ESTs and BAC-end sequences. Five whole BAC sequences (approximately 100&#x02009;kb in length) were also completely covered in the scaffolds with minor in-dels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). One of the BAC sequences included 12.6&#x02009;kb of the <italic>Tpn1</italic> family transposon, <italic>TpnA2</italic> (see below), suggesting that repetitive elements with high copy numbers and relatively long sequences were successfully determined. The SOAPdenovo assembly was also able to cover the five BAC sequences, but with large in-dels and an increased number of mismatches, indicating that per-base resolution was better in the assembly using PacBio reads. Telomeric repeats, centromeric repeats, and rDNA arrays were identified to further analyse the contiguity of the assembly. Thirty scaffolds, with telomeric repeat units (AAACCCT) in the range of 47.1 to 4,613.9 repeating units, were identified, of which 13 were completely covered by the tandem repeats and could not be incorporated into the linkage maps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). Pseudo-chromosomes 2, 6, 8 and 14 were found to have telomeric repeats at both the ends, while pseudo-chromosomes 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 15 had telomeric repeats at only one end. Although SOAPdenovo assembly captured 27 telomeric repeat sequences, the average size of the repeats was five times longer in the PacBio assembly. The ribosomal DNAs (rDNAs) in the order of 18S, 5.8S and 25S rDNAs are found to occur in tandem arrays typically spanning several megabase pairs in regions called nucleolar organizer regions (NORs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Three scaffolds were found to contain 3 NOR units and 34 scaffolds had 2 NOR units (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 9</xref>). In total, 1,212 5S rDNA sequences were clustered in 21 scaffolds that were located away from the scaffolds carrying NORs. Centromeric repeats are known to span hundreds of kilobase pairs to several megabase pairs and are difficult to be assembled owing to their repetitive complexity. The centromeric monomer sequence was identified to be 173&#x02009;bp in length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). Using the monomeric sequence as a base, the longest centromeric repeat stretches were identified for each chromosome and the analysis revealed that two of the identified centromeric repeat stretches were longer than 100&#x02009;kb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 10</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Repeat analysis and identification of <italic>Tpn1</italic> transposons</title><p>Analysis using RepeatModeler (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 11</xref>) showed that LTRs (long terminal repeats) comprised the largest portion of predicted repeats. The unclassified elements were mined for copia and gypsy repeats using RepBase. Copia and gypsy elements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 12</xref>) comprised 12.92 and 14.46&#x00025; of the assembled genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>).

However, RepeatModeler was not able to predict <italic>Tpn1</italic> family transposons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). Hence, an in-house pipeline based on the presence of 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; TIRs as well as target site duplications (TSDs) was used to identify the <italic>Tpn1</italic> transposons. In total, 339 <italic>Tpn1</italic> transposons were identified with an average length of 7,081&#x02009;bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>). The smallest identified was 161&#x02009;bp in length, while the longest was 40,619&#x02009;bp. All the transposons had 3-bp TSDs, with the exception of one that had a 5-bp TSD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 13</xref>). Fourteen of them had a mismatch in their TSDs. The TSDs tended to be AT rich (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>), with at least one of A or T bp appearing in 95&#x00025; of the TSDs. A nucleotide BLAST analysis revealed that most of the <italic>Tpn1</italic> transposons carried SRR sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>) in both 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; terminal regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>). Because TIR and SRR sequences are <italic>cis</italic>-requirements for transposition, it can be suggested that the <italic>Tpn1</italic> transposons are capable of transposition. However, thirty-two of the identified <italic>Tpn1</italic> transposons contained large rearrangements in SRR indicating that they are inactive. Twenty-nine <italic>Tpn1</italic> transposons were found within the 5&#x02032; UTR and introns of the predicted genes, which could disrupt the function of those genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 14</xref>).

A translated BLAST search against the 339 <italic>Tpn1</italic> family transposons, using TnpA and TnpD sequences from maize and snapdragon<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> as queries, revealed that two transposons, named <italic>TpnA3</italic> and <italic>TpnA4</italic>, carried <italic>TnpD</italic> homologues, with two copies of <italic>TpnA3</italic> residing in the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). No obvious <italic>TnpA</italic> homologues were identified in the 339 transposons. Also, no transcripts corresponding to <italic>TnpA</italic> and <italic>TnpD</italic> were found in the predicted genes or transcripts, indicating transcription of the transposase sequences was silenced in the line TKS. To identify autonomous transposons, the cDNA fragments for <italic>TnpA</italic> and <italic>TnpD</italic> homologues were isolated by a series of RT&#x02013;PCRs from the line Q1072, where <italic>Tpn1</italic> actively transposes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1m</xref>). A nucleotide BLAST search, against the whole-genome sequence using the isolated cDNA sequences as queries, identified two transposons with <italic>TnpA</italic> and <italic>TnpD</italic> sequences, designated as <italic>TpnA1</italic> and <italic>TpnA2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>).

The restriction enzyme pairs were <italic>Nde</italic>I/<italic>Bgl</italic>II and <italic>Mse</italic>I/<italic>Bgl</italic>II (New England Biolabs), and the adapter sequences of TruSeq MseI_NdeI and BglII adaptors are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 20</xref>. The prepared libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 platform as 151-bp single-end reads. Forty-three <italic>I. nil</italic> lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 16</xref>) were also used to characterize the <italic>CT</italic> gene. The <italic>a3-flecked</italic> mutant, Q1072, was used to isolate <italic>TnpA</italic> and <italic>TnpD</italic> mRNA, and an authentic <italic>s</italic> mutant line, Q721, was used for genetic complementation test for the <italic>kbt</italic> mutant, Q837.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Genome assembly</title><p>Before assembling the Illumina short read data set, adapters were trimmed using Cutadapt v1.2.1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>). Using k-mer frequencies of the short insert libraries, SOAPdenovo2's error correction module (v2.01) was used to correct errors with the following parameters: &#x02018;-l 80 -Q 33 -j 1 -o 3 -r 50'. The processed reads were assembled, scaffolded and gap-filled using SOAPdenovo2 assembler v2.04 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) with a k-mer value of 115. The work-flow (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>) of the assembly of longer PacBio reads began with contig assembly using HGAP3 pipeline<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref> from SMRTanalysis v2.3.0. For HGAP3, the following parameters were used: PreAssembler Filter v1 (minimum sub-read length=500, minimum polymerase read length=100, and minimum polymerase read quality=0.80); PreAssembler v2 (minimum seed read length=6,000, number of seed read chunks=6, alignment candidates per chunk=10, total alignment candidates=24, minimum coverage for correction=6, and blasr options='minReadLength=200, maxScore=1,000, maxLCPLength =16, and noSplitSubReads'); AssembleUnitig v1 (genome size=750&#x02009;Mb, target coverage=30, overlap error rate=0.06, minimum overlap length=40, and overlapper k-mer=14); Mapping (Maximum number of hits per read=10, maximum divergence &#x00025;=30, minimum anchor size=12, and pbalign options='seed =1, minAccuracy=0.75, minLength=50, useQuality, and placeRepeatsRandomly'). The polymerase N50 and the sub-read N50 at the assembly phase was recorded as 12.3 and 10.5&#x02009;kb, respectively. The initial assembly was followed by two rounds of polishing by Quiver. To correct PacBio residual errors, the Illumina reads were aligned against the contigs using BWA v0.7.12 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). After sorting the alignments and marking duplicates using Picard tools v2.1.1 ( <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://picard.sourceforge.net/">http://picard.sourceforge.net/</ext-link>), Genome Analysis ToolKit v3.5 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>) was used to perform local realignment around in-dels and to call variants using the module, HaplotypeCaller. Variant filtering was performed using the expression: &#x02018;DP&#x0003c;20.0||QD&#x0003c;2.0||FS&#x0003e;60.0||MQ&#x0003c;40.0'. The homozygous in-dels were treated as errors, and were replaced with Illumina read bases in the assembled contigs using FastaAlternateReferenceMaker. MUMmer v3.23 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>) was used to identify and remove contigs, if more than 50&#x00025; of their sequence was either mitochondrial or chloroplast sequence. Smaller contigs, which had greater than 98&#x00025; sequence coverage in other contigs with at least 98&#x00025; sequence identity, were also removed from the assembly. The contigs were then scaffolded with the help of 15 and 20&#x02009;kb Illumina mate pair read libraries, with the options &#x02018;no_score and e=10' using BESST scaffolder<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. A first round of splitting chimeric scaffolds was performed before gap-filling. PacBio reads were utilized to gap-fill the scaffolds using PBJelly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref> with the blasr options &#x02018;minMatch=8, minPctIdentity=70, bestn =1, nCandidates=20, maxScore=500, and noSplitSubreads'. If the flanking sequences, at the gap junctions, had an overlap of more than 1&#x02009;kb, those gaps were filled by joining the flanking sequences manually.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Linkage map construction and pseudo-chromosome assignment</title><p>The RAD-seq technique<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> was employed to sequence 2 parent samples (TKS and Africa lines) and 207 progeny samples. The Illumina short reads from the parent samples and progeny samples were aligned against the assembly using BWA v0.7.12 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). The reads which were not tagged as uniquely mapped, and those which did not have the requisite restriction enzyme cut site were filtered out. STACKS v1.37 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>) was used to identify SNP and the following two criteria were used to filter markers: (a) Each marker should be present in at least 80&#x00025; of the samples, and (b) Each sample should have at least 80&#x00025; of the markers. Also, 150&#x02009;bp flanking regions from either side of each SNP location was extracted from the assembly and was aligned against each other using BLAST to check for repetitive regions. Any region with an alignment length of longer than 150 bases were filtered out. Onemap<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref> was used to create linkage maps with an LOD score of 30. TMAP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref> was used to re-order the linkage map, along with manual inspection. The original classical map contained 10 linkage groups (LGs), although <italic>I. nil</italic> has 15 chromosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. The marker genes from seven of the 10 LGs of the classical map<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> were mapped in the current RAD-based linkage maps, and the LGs were named 1 to 6 and 10 correspondingly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 22</xref>). Because two LGs in our RAD-marker based map corresponded to LG3 in the classical map, they were accordingly assigned as LG3 and LG11 with the corresponding marker genes being <italic>DUSKY</italic> and <italic>SPECKLED</italic> respectively. This coincided with the fact that the <italic>DUSKY</italic> and <italic>SPECKLED</italic> genes were mapped on the different linkage groups in the older linkage analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. LGs 7 to 9 and 12 to 15 were numbered randomly.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mis-assembly elimination and assembly validation</title><p>Before anchoring scaffolds to pseudo-chromosomes, chimeric assemblies were first resolved using linkage maps and BAC-end sequences. Contigs were first aligned against the scaffolds using the NUCmer module within MUMmer v3.23 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>) to identify the contig locations in the scaffolds. If a scaffold contained a stretch of linkage markers pointing to two different linkage groups with a scaffold junction (N) in between, it was considered a chimera and was split into two at the junction. If the mis-assembly occurred at the contig level, the bac-end alignments were used as a key in splitting chimeric contigs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). Based on the order of the linkage maps, the scaffolds were merged using Ns as gaps to form pseudo-chromosomes. The orientations of the scaffolds were determined using the marker order, and the orientations of scaffolds with inadequate markers were ignored but included as part of the pseudo-chromosomes. The circular view of the genome was generated using Circos<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. CEGMA v2.5 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) and BUSCO<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, two commonly used genome assembly validation pipelines, were used to validate the completeness of genes in the assembly. BLAT was used to align ESTs and BAC-end paired reads against the assembly. In-house scripts were written, which calculated paired BLAT scores from both the BAC-end read pairs and picked up the best paired hits based on the combined score. RNA-seq reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic v0.33 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>) and TopHat v2.1.0 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>) was used to align the RNA-seq reads with default parameters. Tandem repeats finder v4.07b (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>) was used to identify tandem repeats using the parameters &#x02018;1 1 2 80 5 200 2000 -d -h'. Inspection of short tandem repeats at the ends of the contigs revealed the monomer &#x02018;AAACCCT' to be the telomeric repeat. Manual inspection of the tandem repeats also revealed the centromeric repeat monomer to be of approximately 173&#x02009;bp in length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). A tetramer centromeric repeat sequence was used to search against the whole output of tandem repeats finder using BLAST. The BLAST alignment results were screened for monomer sequences closer to 173&#x02009;bp length to identify centromeric repeat candidates. Tandem centromeric repeat stretches (&#x0003e;3&#x02009;kb) were merged, when they were within a distance of 50&#x02009;kb and the longest stretch for every chromosome was identified to approximate the putative position of the centromeres. Infernal v1.1.1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>) was used to identify rDNA clusters by searching against Rfam v12.0.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Repeat analysis and gene prediction</title><p><italic>De novo</italic> repeat identification was done using RepeatModeler v1.0.7 which combines RECON and RepeatScout<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref> programs, followed by RepeatMasker v4.0.2 to achieve the final results. <italic>Tpn1</italic> family transposons were detected using the following approach: The TIRs of the <italic>Tpn1</italic> transposons (28&#x02009;bp in length) were searched using BLAST; the aligned TIR co-ordinates were sorted by their locations; if two nearby TIRs contained the same TSDs (3&#x02013;5&#x02009;bp), they were nominated as <italic>Tpn1</italic> family elements. The sub-terminal repeats were also identified using BLAST to determine the orientation of the <italic>Tpn1</italic> elements. A translated BLAST search against the identified transposons using TnpA and TnpD sequences from maize and snapdragon as queries revealed non-autonomous <italic>TpnA3</italic> and <italic>TpnA4</italic>. To isolate autonomous <italic>Tpn1</italic> transposons, the cDNA fragments of <italic>TnpA</italic> and <italic>TnpD</italic> homologue were isolated from Q1072 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). Using the isolated cDNA sequences as query, <italic>TpnA1</italic> and <italic>TpnA2</italic> were identified by screening against the assembled scaffolds using BLAST. As the 5&#x02032; terminal of <italic>TpnA1</italic> was not assembled completely in the genome sequence, a BAC clone from TKS carrying the entire <italic>TpnA1</italic> sequence was isolated and characterized (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). Repeats obtained by both the above mentioned approaches were masked for gene prediction. The genes harbouring <italic>Tpn1</italic> transposon insertions were identified using the gene and the transposon co-ordinates and were annotated using the web version of BLASTX. Gene models were predicted using Augustus v3.2.2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>) with tomato as the reference species, using hints from RNA-seq alignments, and also allowing prediction of untranslated regions (UTRs). Because of the scarcity of complete CDs of <italic>I. nil</italic> in public databases, independently, Augustus was also used to predict gene models, after training using CEGMA predicted genes, and the procedure resulted in more than 55,000 gene models. The 189 complete CDs sequences already available in NCBI were downloaded and compared against the predicted gene models using BLAT. Tomato based gene models showed that 116 out of 189 CDs were perfectly complete, whereas CEGMA trained gene models showed that only 61 out of 189 CDs were complete and hence, the tomato based gene predictions were used for further analysis. The gene models were translated to proteins and were aligned against proteins from UniProt-Swiss-Prot and UniProt-TrEMBL databases using NCBI BLAST&#x0002b; v2.2.29 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>). Using an e-value cut-off of e-5 for annotation, alignments from the Swiss-Prot database were given preference ahead of the TrEMBL database. In other words, TrEMBL annotations were assigned for only those entries without a Swiss-Prot annotation. To extract protein domain annotations, InterProScan v5.19-58.0 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>) was used to assign Pfam domains to the gene models.

The alignments were filtered using the criteria that coding sequences from each of the species should have covered at least 95&#x00025; of the multiple sequence alignments, thereby, reducing the gaps to less than 5&#x00025; of the alignments.
