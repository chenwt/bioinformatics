It remains unknown whether this resistance has a unique origin with the same molecular basis or is multifactorial. Knowledge of the origin, mechanisms and evolution of resistance are crucial to designing successful resistance management strategies.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Here, we established the resistance profile of a Zambian <italic>An. funestus</italic> population at the northern range of the resistance front. Similar to other Southern African populations, Zambian <italic>An. funestus</italic> mosquitoes are resistant to pyrethroids and carbamate, but in contrast to populations in Mozambique and Malawi, these insects are also DDT resistant. Genome-wide microarray-based transcriptional profiling and qRT-PCR revealed that the cytochrome P450 gene <italic>CYP6M7</italic> is responsible for extending pyrethroid resistance northwards. Indeed, <italic>CYP6M7</italic> is more over-expressed in Zambia [fold-change (FC) 37.7; 13.2 for qRT-PCR] than <italic>CYP6P9a</italic> (FC15.6; 8.9 for qRT-PCR) and <italic>CYP6P9b</italic> (FC11.9; 6.5 for qRT-PCR), whereas <italic>CYP6P9a</italic> and <italic>CYP6P9b</italic> are more highly over-expressed in Malawi and Mozambique. Transgenic expression of <italic>CYP6M7</italic> in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> coupled with <italic>in vitro</italic> assays using recombinant enzymes and assessments of kinetic properties demonstrated that <italic>CYP6M7</italic> is as efficient as <italic>CYP6P9a</italic> and <italic>CYP6P9b</italic> in conferring pyrethroid resistance. Polymorphism patterns demonstrate that these genes are under contrasting selection forces: the exceptionally diverse <italic>CYP6M7</italic> likely evolves neutrally, whereas <italic>CYP6P9a</italic> and <italic>CYP6P9b</italic> are directionally selected.

Nearly 216 million cases are reported each year, with an estimated 655,000 deaths in 2010, 86% of which occurred in children under the age of five [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Malaria control relies extensively on the use of insecticides, either in Long Lasting Insecticide Nets (LLINs) or as Indoor Residual Sprays (IRS). Unfortunately, increasing resistance to the available insecticide classes in the major malaria vectors, such as <italic>Anopheles funestus</italic>, is threatening the effectiveness of these control tools across Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The recent WHO Global Plan for Insecticide Resistance Management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] highlights the growing threat posed by insecticide resistance and calls for urgent action to implement suitable resistance management strategies against malaria vectors to ensure the continued effectiveness of control interventions. The elucidation of the molecular basis of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors is a crucial step in the design and implementation of these resistance management strategies.</p><p>Resistance to pyrethroid insecticides is of particular concern because these insecticides are the only class recommended by WHO for the impregnation of LLINs. Previous efforts to characterize the mechanisms of pyrethroid resistance in <italic>An. funestus</italic> have revealed that resistance is mainly driven by metabolic resistance with cytochrome P450 genes playing a major role while target-site resistance through knockdown resistance (<italic>kdr</italic>) was absent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Two duplicated cytochrome P450 genes, <italic>CYP6P9a</italic> and <italic>CYP6P9b</italic>, were recently showed to play a key role in the resistance observed in the Southern African countries of Malawi and Mozambique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The similarity in the gene expression profiles and the presence of a highly predominant resistance haplotype for each gene in the two countries suggested that the resistance had a unique origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, recent susceptibility studies have demonstrated that the pyrethroid resistance front is expanding further northward across Southern Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The factors behind this expansion remained uncharacterized, and it remains unknown if, beyond Malawi and Mozambique, the pyrethroid resistance front is still of a unique origin as previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Resistance can spread from a single origin through gene flow between populations and can involve a single resistance mechanism. This phenomenon was responsible for the worldwide spread of DDT resistance under the control of the <italic>CYP6G1</italic> gene in the fruit fly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The expansion of the resistance front could also originate from multiple independent selection events by different selection forces, potentially leading to the involvement of multiple resistance mechanisms in the overall resistance front. This phenomenon has been observed in the other major malaria vector <italic>An. gambiae</italic>, in which pyrethroid/DDT resistance is now widespread and is associated with various mechanisms, including two 1014&#x000a0;F/S knockdown resistance mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and over-transcription of various metabolic genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It is not known if the expansion of pyrethroid resistance in Southern African populations of <italic>An. funestus</italic> is driven by different resistance mechanisms as in <italic>An. gambiae</italic> or by the same underlying resistance mechanism under the control of different genes. Furthermore, whether genes other than <italic>CYP6P9a</italic> and <italic>CYP6P9b</italic> are also responsible for the expansion of the resistance front remains to be determined. This information has important operational implications for the implementation of resistance management strategies against <italic>An. funestus</italic> across this region.</p><p>In addition, because the main tool used previously was a microarray chip based on a set of 8,540 <italic>An. funestus</italic> Expressed Sequenced Tags (ESTs) that did not cover the full transcriptome of this species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], it is possible that other important resistance genes may contribute to the pyrethroid resistance previously characterized in Mozambique and Malawi. The availability of another RNAseq EST set with more than 15,000 ESTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] has enabled increased transcriptome coverage and a more comprehensive elucidation of the molecular basis of pyrethroid resistance in <italic>An. funestus</italic>.</p><p>The present study aimed to answer two main questions. i) Is the pyrethroid resistance front across Southern African <italic>An. funestus</italic> populations driven by same resistance mechanisms? ii) Are genes other than <italic>CYP6P9a</italic> and <italic>CYP6P9b</italic> also responsible for the previously reported resistance to pyrethroids in <italic>An. funestus</italic> in Mozambique and Malawi?</p><p>In this study, after establishing the resistance profile of a Zambian <italic>An. funestus</italic> population, we used genome-wide transcriptional and functional analyses to demonstrate that the cytochrome P450 <italic>CYP6M7</italic> has efficiently partnered with the previously detected <italic>CYP6P9a</italic> and <italic>CYP6P9b</italic> to expand the pyrethroid resistance front northward. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these three genes are under constrasting selection forces; the exceptionally polymorphic <italic>CYP6M7</italic> evolving neutrally, whereas <italic>CYP6P9a</italic> and <italic>CYP6P9b</italic> are both under directional selection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Area of study and mosquito collection</title><p>Blood-fed female <italic>An. funestus</italic> adults resting indoors were collected in houses between 06.00 and 12.00&#x000a0;AM in Mbinga (Katete District) (14&#x000b0; 11' 0" S, 31&#x000b0; 52' 0" E) in eastern Zambia in October 2010.

Similarly, after PBO exposure, significant recovery of susceptibility to the carbamate bendiocarb from 0% to 86.5% was observed, further supporting an important role of P450s in the carbamate resistance observed in Zambia. However, the absence of a complete recovery of susceptibility suggests the potential involvement of other mechanisms. Exposure to PBO only moderately increased DDT mortality from 60.6 to 83.8%, suggesting that the potential role of P450s in DDT resistance might not be as important as in pyrethroid or carbamate resistance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Genome-wide microarray-based transcriptional profiling</title><p>A new genome-wide <italic>An. funestus</italic> custom Agilent microarray chip containing 60,000 probes (60mer) was used to identify genes associated with pyrethroid resistance in a Zambian population for the first time.

The qRT-PCR results confirmed the over-expression patterns observed by microarray, although with generally lower fold change values (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). A similar expression pattern was observed for the control samples that were not exposed to insecticides from each of the three countries (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1B). Particular attention was paid to the <italic>CYP6M7</italic> to validate its high over-expression. The qRT-PCR results from the three independent primer pairs on <italic>CYP6M7</italic> confirmed that this gene is over-expressed in the three countries with FC of 21.0, 11.75 and 13.25 respectively in Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia when averaging over the three primers.

The Mozambique sample exhibited the highest over-expression for the three main pyrethroid candidate resistance gene in correlation with microarray in line with the high pyrethroid resistance observed in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, in Malawi, no significant difference was observed in the expression of the three genes in contrast to microarray.

A significant correlation between the qRT-PCR and microarray results was observed in the combined sample of the three countries (R<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.4;P&#x0003c;0.05) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1C).</p><p><bold>Tissue</bold>-<bold>specific expression profile of main candidate resistance genes</bold>: Assessment of the tissue-specific expression profile of the main resistance genes by qRT-PCR showed that <italic>CYP6P9a</italic>, <italic>CYP6P9b</italic> and <italic>CYP6M7</italic> were all similarly expressed in the head, thorax and abdomen (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C). Indeed, the fold-change observed in these body parts is not significantly different from that of the whole body.

This lack of correlation between <italic>CYP6M7</italic> polymorphism and permethrin resistance is further supported by the similar levels of polymorphisms in both resistant and susceptible mosquitoes in the 3 countries, as measured by the number of polymorphic sites or by haplotypic (hd) and genetic (&#x003c0;) diversities (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4 and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S6A), which also differs from the findings for <italic>CYP6P9a</italic> (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S6B) and <italic>CYP6P9b</italic> (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S6C). However, sliding window analysis of the genetic diversity indicates a significant difference in polymorphism levels between susceptible and resistant samples for the 696&#x000a0;bp non-coding region (paired t-test, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01), with higher diversity among the total susceptible sample across the three countries compared to the resistant sample (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S6D).

The codon-based test performed between sequence pairs also revealed that most Z values (dS-dN) were positive, irrespective of the resistance phenotype of the samples. A very high proportion of Z values (dS-dN) (64 to 98.4%) were associated with significant <italic>P</italic> values, supporting a significant excess of synonymous substitutions per site over non-synonymous substitutions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S5).</p><p><bold>Polymorphisms of</bold><bold><italic>CYP6P9a</italic></bold><bold>and</bold><bold><italic>CYP6P9b</italic></bold><bold>in the Zambian sample</bold>: Analysis of the polymorphism patterns of <italic>CYP6P9a</italic> and <italic>CYP6P9b</italic> in the Zambian sample revealed the same reduction of genetic diversity (number of substitutions, genetic diversity (&#x003c0;) and haplotype number) in resistant mosquitoes that was previously observed in the Malawian and Mozambican samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S6 and S7). However, both genes were more variable in the Zambia sample than in the Mozambican and Malawian samples with notably more mutational steps between haplotypes. Indeed, only 1 haplotype of <italic>CYP6P9a</italic> was more than 4 mutational steps from any other in the Malawian and Mozambican samples, whereas in the Zambia sample, all haplotypes were between 5 to 18 mutational steps apart (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S7A, S7B and S7C). In addition, the frequencies of the predominant haplotypes of both genes were lower in Zambia. This difference is more evident for the <italic>CYP6P9b</italic>, for which the predominant haplotype (H1) found in the Mozambican (84.5%; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S7D) and Malawian (95%; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S7E) samples is not present in the Zambian sample, which, by contrast, featured two predominant haplotypes, ZB6 (40%) and ZB7 (35%) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S7F). These haplotypes were separated by 1 and 2 mutations, respectively, from haplotype H1 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C). Furthermore, analysis of the maximum likelihood tree of <italic>CYP6P9a</italic> and <italic>CYP6P9b</italic> haplotypes detected a cluster of haplotypes only specific to Zambia (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S5B and S5C).

Determining whether one or more resistance profiles are present can facilitate the design and implementation of successful vector control strategies. The comparative analysis of the susceptibility profile of the Zambian population with those of the Mozambican and Malawian populations suggests that the resistance observed in Southern Africa might not have developed from a single origin and spread over the region as previously suggested based on the similarity between Mozambican and Malawian populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Local selection factors probably play an important role in the expansion of this resistance as highlighted by the significant differences in the resistance profiles of the Zambian population compared with the Malawian and Mozambican populations. The DDT resistance observed in the Zambian population contrasts with the full susceptibility to this insecticide in the Mozambican population and the very moderate resistance in the Malawian population, suggesting that local selection factors in Zambia (from agriculture or from public health control interventions such as IRS) could be responsible for this DDT resistance. The higher carbamate resistance of the Zambian sample compared to the Malawian and Mozambican samples further supports this observation. In <italic>An. gambiae</italic>, local selection factors have played a similarly important role in the development of resistance, such as in the highly selected agricultural settings in Burkina Faso [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and in Benin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

The fact that similar consistent over-expression for <italic>CYP6M7</italic> was observed from the qRT-PCR results using three different primer pairs further validates the up-regulation of this gene in relation to pyrethroid resistance. Interestingly, probes from <italic>CYP6M3</italic>, the ortholog of <italic>CYP6M7</italic> in <italic>An. gambiae</italic>, were found to be significantly over-expressed in the pyrethroid resistant laboratory <italic>An. funestus</italic> FUMOZ strain compared to the laboratory susceptible FANG strain during a microarray analysis using the <italic>An. gambiae</italic> "detox chip" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. <italic>CYP6M7</italic> was also previously mapped within the <italic>rp2</italic> pyrethroid resistance QTL in a crossing between FUMOZ and FANG strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Altogether, the consistent over-expression of <italic>CYP6M7</italic> and the demonstration that this gene can metabolize pyrethroids both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, support the view that <italic>CYP6M7</italic> is significantly contributing to pyrethroid resistance in southern Africa. The two to seven-fold reduced expression of both <italic>CYP6P9a</italic> and <italic>CYP6P9b</italic> in Zambia from microarray in contrast to Mozambique and Malawi, could even signal a possible shift in underlying molecular basis of pyrethroid resistance across the region with <italic>CYP6M7</italic> possibly playing a more important in such locations. However, it will be useful in future studies to further validate this potential shift in gene expression of the main resistance genes using other methods such as RNAseq which contrary to microarray and qRT-PCR is not affected by the sequence polymorphism of targeted genes. The reasons for the potential shift in the expression levels of the three genes remain unknown but could be due to the nature of the selection that gave rise to the resistance. This shift in gene expression further highlights the genetic plasticity of natural populations of malaria vectors and their ability to adapt to various selection pressures. Similar geographical variations in expression levels between detoxification genes have been observed in other mosquito vectors, such as <italic>An. gambiae</italic>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for different P450 genes to be associated with a same resistance profile such as the case for the <italic>CYP6A1</italic> and <italic>CYP6D1</italic> in the house fly <italic>Musca domestica</italic>, or for <italic>CYP6A2</italic>, <italic>CYP6A8</italic> and <italic>CYP6G1</italic> in the fruit fly <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].

It will be a concern for control programs if the three genes were equally highly up-regulated in a single population, as this may significantly increase the overall pyrethroid resistance level of such mosquito populations.</p><p>However, kinetic analysis of the three recombinant enzymes suggests that <italic>CYP6P9b</italic> may metabolize pyrethroids more efficiently than the other two enzymes. This result will need to be further confirmed since kinetic profiles obtained through <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments are unlikely to reflect 100% their <italic>in vivo</italic> patterns stemming from potential variations in the <italic>in vivo</italic> intrinsic clearance of the insecticide in the mosquito. Variations in insecticide metabolism among resistance genes are not uncommon and were previously observed in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> when seven P450 genes were compared for their ability to confer resistance using transgenic expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. However, more work is needed to fully establish the metabolic efficiency of these enzymes against all pyrethroids. Another area of investigation will be to establish their patterns of cross-resistance to other insecticide classes. Such P450 cross-resistance to different insecticide classes was recently reported in <italic>An. gambiae</italic> for the <italic>CYP6M2</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] or for the <italic>CYP6G1</italic> in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> which has been showed to metabolize a wide range of insecticides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Similarly, it will be interesting to determine if the increased <italic>CYP6M7</italic> expression in the Zambian population also plays a role in the DDT resistance or bendiocarb resistance observed in this country.</p><p>The change in the resistance profile observed in Zambia was also reflected in the transcription profile of this mosquito population with the over-expression of more GSTs and carboxylesterases in this country. The low over-expression of the <italic>GSTe2</italic> gene, along with the absence of the <italic>GSTe2</italic> L119F mutation commonly associated with DDT resistance in West Africa, suggest that the mechanisms of DDT resistance in Zambia are different than those observed in West and Central Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The seven-fold over-expression of the <italic>GSTD3</italic> in Zambia than in the DDT-susceptible populations of Mozambique and Malawi could suggest that the up-regulation of this gene could be associated with the DDT resistance in Zambia. However, further work is needed to establish the exact contribution of this gene and others with the resistance observed against pyrethroids or DDT and bendiocarb in this study. The contribution of several genes to metabolic resistance to insecticides is a common trait in mosquitoes and is also observed in other vectors such as <italic>An. gambiae</italic>, in which the P450 gene, <italic>CYP6P3</italic>, combines with <italic>CYP6M2</italic> to confer pyrethroid resistance in field populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

The involvement of a multiplicity of genes in metabolic resistance is a further challenge to the ultimate aim of detecting resistance markers that could be used to design suitable DNA-based diagnostic tools to easily detect such resistance in the field.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Contrasting selection patterns shape the diversity of <italic>CYP6M7</italic>and the duplicated <italic>CYP6P9a</italic>and <italic>CYP6P9b</italic></title><p><italic>CYP6M7</italic> is highly polymorphic, with 1 SNP every 15&#x000a0;bp in the coding regions and 1 SNP every 9&#x000a0;bp when non-coding regions are included.

By contrast, the considerable differences observed in the amino acid sequences of <italic>CYP6P9a</italic> and <italic>CYP6P9b</italic> between resistant and susceptible mosquitoes suggests that allelic variation at these two genes impact their ability to confer pyrethroid resistance.

Beside a possible trans-regulation of <italic>CYP6M7</italic>, the absence of a directional selection on <italic>CYP6M7</italic> could also stem from a more generalist functional role of this gene, particularly if it could protect the mosquito against a broad range of xenobiotics or against plant toxins (allelochemicals) or even if it were involved in functions other than detoxification. This could explain why a single allele has not been favored. By contrast, the directional selection acting on both <italic>CYP6P9a</italic> and <italic>CYP6P9b</italic> with a selection of favorable alleles could be due to a more specialist role of these genes against mainly pyrethroid insecticides. Similarly, structural differences associated with sequence polymorphisms have been observed between the generalist cytochrome P450 <italic>CYP6B8</italic> (which is able to metabolize a variety of allelochemicals and insecticides) in the polyphagous noctuid <italic>Helicoverpa zea</italic> and the specialist <italic>CYP6B1</italic> in the black swallowtail butterfly <italic>Papilio polyxenes</italic>, a specialist restricted to furanocoumarin-containing plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Further evaluation of the substrate spectrum metabolism of <italic>CYP6M7</italic>, <italic>CYP6P9a</italic> and <italic>CYP6P9b</italic> is needed to confirm this hypothesis.</p><p>The higher genetic diversity of <italic>CYP6P9a</italic> and <italic>CYP6P9b</italic> in the Zambian sample compared to the Malawian and Mozambican samples correlates with the lower expression of both genes in the Zambian sample. This supports the conclusion that both genes could be under less selective pressure in Zambia. This variation in the diversity of both genes in relation to their role in pyrethroid resistance is similar to the differences in the genetic variability of the glutathione S-transferase <italic>GSTe2</italic> in <italic>An. funestus</italic> with DDT resistance across Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Very low genetic variability is observed in high DDT resistance regions, whereas higher variability is observed in more susceptible regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. A similar distribution of variation in the <italic>CYP6G1</italic> P450 gene has been associated with DDT resistance in <italic>Drosophila simulans</italic>. This gene has significantly lower diversity in DDT-resistant populations from California and higher polymorphism in DDT-susceptible populations from Zimbabwe [58].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, the results from this study have helped to shed more light into the molecular complexities of the resistance mechanisms underlying pyrethroid resistance in southern African populations of <italic>An. funestus</italic>. Indeed, this study has revealed that beside the previously known resistance genes <italic>CYP6P9a</italic> and <italic>CYP6P9b</italic>, the <italic>CYP6M7</italic> P450 gene is also playing a key role in the pyrethroid resistance observed in the region and that its role may even become more important in the northern range of the resistance front such as in Zambia. Therefore, despite the similarities observed, the underlying molecular basis of pyrethroid resistance is probably not uniform across its distribution range in Southern Africa. The northern range in Zambia exhibits significant differences from Malawi and Mozambique in term of the profile and molecular basis of resistance. It is therefore likely that beyond Mozambique and Malawi, pyrethroid resistance in southern Africa has multiple origins under different evolutionary forces, which may necessitate the design of different resistance management strategies to mitigate the impact of this resistance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec26"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="12864_2014_6509_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>Additional file 1: Table S1: List of primers used in this study. <bold>Table S2.</bold> Top 50 probes the most commonly up-regulated in R-S in Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia. <bold>Table S3.</bold> Top 20 probes the most commonly down-regulated in R-S in Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia. <bold>Table S4.</bold> Summary statistics for polymorphism of <italic>CYP6M7</italic> between susceptible and resistant mosquitoes in Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique. <bold>Table S5.</bold> Codon-based Test of Selection for <italic>CYP6M7</italic> for analysis averaging over all sequence pairs within each group. <bold>Table S6.</bold> Summary statistics for polymorphism of <italic>CYP6P9a</italic> between susceptible and resistant mosquitoes in Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique. <bold>Table S7.</bold> Summary statistics for polymorphism of <italic>CYP6P9b</italic> between susceptible and resistant mosquitoes in Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique. <bold>Table S8.</bold> Genetic differentiation using <italic>KST</italic> for <italic>CYP6P9a</italic>, <italic>CYP6P9b</italic> and <italic>CYP6M7</italic>.
