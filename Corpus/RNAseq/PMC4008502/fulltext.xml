The aim of this study was to investigate the potential roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in diet-induced hepatic steatosis in this species. MiRNAs, small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level, are involved in diverse biological processes, including lipid metabolism. Deep sequencing of hepatic small RNA libraries from blunt snout bream fed normal-fat and high-fat diets identified 202 (193 known and 9 novel) miRNAs, of which 12 were differentially expressed between the normal-fat and high-fat diet groups. Quantitative stem-loop reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses confirmed the upregulation of miR-30c and miR-30e-3p and the downregulation of miR-145 and miR-15a-5p in high-fat diet-fed fish. Bioinformatics tools were used to predict the targets of these verified miRNAs and to explore potential downstream gene ontology biological process categories and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. Six putative lipid metabolism-related target genes (fetuin-B, Cyp7a1, NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 beta subcomplex subunit 2, 3-oxoacid CoA transferase 1b, stearoyl-CoA desaturase, and fatty-acid synthase) were identified as having potential important roles in the development of diet-induced hepatic steatosis in blunt snout bream. The results presented here are a foundation for future studies of miRNA-controlled lipid metabolism regulatory networks in blunt snout bream.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project 60901053, 31172418 and 31202005), the Open Fund of Key Laboratory of Freshwater Fisheries and Germplasm Resources Utilization, Ministry of Agriculture, Freshwater Fisheries Research Center, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences (NO.

Due to its herbivorous instinct and relatively low ratio of liver weight to body weight, blunt snout bream is highly susceptible to hepatic steatosis when fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for the purpose of protein sparing in an intensive culture system. Therefore, this species is a useful model to study the physiology of lipid metabolism and to compare it to that of other species such as zebrafish and medaka <xref rid="pone.0096132-Matsumoto1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096132-Her1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Dietary fat comprises a group of water-soluble molecules that includes cholesterol and triglycerides. The liver synthesizes lipoproteins and, depending on the species, is more or less the epicentre of fatty-acid synthesis and lipid circulation.

A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that lead to liver steatosis in fish remains elusive and the identification of target genes and pathways controlled by miRNAs is critical to understanding their function in lipid metabolism. High-throughput sequencing technologies can detect and quantify the expression levels of known and novel miRNAs. Here, hepatic small RNA libraries from blunt snout bream fed a normal-fat diet (NFD) or HFD for eight weeks were characterized. Deep sequencing and stem-loop reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) validation were used to identify miRNAs that were differentially expressed between the two groups. Bioinformatics methods were used to predict targets of the verified miRNAs and to explore the potential downstream gene ontology categories and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways of the target genes. This analysis identified four miRNAs and six putative target genes that may be involved in hepatic lipid metabolism in blunt snout bream. Although a previous study characterized miRNAs involved in the growth of blunt snout bream by examining mixed pools of brain, pituitary, liver and muscle samples <xref rid="pone.0096132-Yi1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, to our knowledge, this study is the first report of miRNA profiling in the liver of this species. The identification of miRNAs and their target genes involved in liver steatosis will provide a better understanding of the biological processes of lipid metabolism and may identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Nanjing Agricultural University (Nanjing, China).

The results suggest that four verified miRNAs and six putative target genes play important roles in hepatic steatosis in blunt snout bream. The results presented here are a foundation for future studies aimed at identifying potential pharmaceutical and nutritional targets in blunt snout bream. Additional <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> investigations are required to gain a complete understanding of the association between miRNA profiles, target genes, and the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis in this species.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0096132.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>Size distributions of small RNAs identified in the normal-fat diet and high-fat diet libraries.</bold></p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0096132.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0096132.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p><bold>Sequences and structures of the three novel miRNAs identified in the normal-fat diet and high-fat diet groups.</bold> Precursor sequences, predicted stem-loop structures and minimum free energies (&#x025b3;G in kcal/mol) of novel_mir-2 (A), novel_mir-4 (B), and novel_mir-7 (C).
