The formation of syncytium is accompanied by profound transcriptional changes and active metabolism in infected tissues. The challenge in gene expression studies for syncytium has always been the isolation of pure syncytial material and subsequent extraction of intact RNA. Root fragments containing syncytium had been used for microarray analyses. However, the inclusion of neighbouring cells dilutes the syncytium-specific mRNA population. Micro-sectioning coupled with laser capture microdissection (LCM) offers an opportunity for the isolation of feeding sites from heterogeneous cell populations. But recovery of intact RNA from syncytium dissected by LCM is complicated due to extended steps of fixation, tissue preparation, embedding and sectioning.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the present study, we have optimized the procedure of sample preparation for LCM to isolate high quality of RNA from cyst nematode induced syncytia in Arabidopsis roots which can be used for transcriptomic studies. We investigated the effect of various sucrose concentrations as cryoprotectant on RNA quality and morphology of syncytial sections. We also compared various types of microscopic slides for strong adherence of sections while removing embedding material.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The use of optimal sucrose concentrations as cryoprotection plays a key role in RNA stability and morphology of sections.

PPNs are classified based on their feeding habits as either ectoparasites or endoparasites. The endoparasitic root-knot (<italic>Meloidogyne</italic> spp.) and cyst nematodes (<italic>Globodera</italic> spp. and <italic>Heterodera</italic> spp.) are sedentary parasites of roots and the primary nematode pathogen of a wide range of crops. Infective stage juveniles (J2s) of cyst nematodes invade the host root and migrate intracellularly until they reach the vascular cylinder. There, these nematodes select an initial syncytial cell (ISC) and become sedentary. Within 24&#x000a0;h of the ISC selection the cells adjacent to the ISC appear hypertrophied and fused together due to local dissolution of the cell walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Three days after ISC selection, the cells that have been incorporated into the syncytium are enlarged and exhibit the features of a typical syncytial cell such as condensed cytoplasm and enrichment of ribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria and plastids. The nuclei have become enlarged, and several smaller vacuoles are present in the cytoplasm. Moreover the outer cell walls thicken to withstand the high osmotic pressure within the syncytium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The syncytium serves as the sole source of nutrients and water for the rest of the nematode&#x02019;s successive growth and development. A cocktail of secretions, which are synthesised in the oesophageal glands of the nematodes, are responsible for the modulation of the plant&#x02019;s defence and the developmental pathways that lead to the formation of a syncytium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Therefore understanding the function of host genes that are required for syncytium development is crucial for identifying novel targets for nematode resistance.</p><p>Compatible interaction is best studied between cyst nematode <italic>Heterodera schachtii</italic> and the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. In recent years a lot of work with this particular pathosystem has shown that the development of the syncytium is accompanied by massive transcriptomic, metabolomic and proteomic changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Nevertheless isolating pure syncytial material and extracting good quality RNA from Arabidopsis roots for downstream application, such as microarray analyses, qPCR and RNA-seq is challenging. Puthoff et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] used the entire root systems of cyst nematode-infected Arabidopsis plants to perform the first transcriptomic studies. However including non-infected cells dilutes the feeding cell specific mRNA expression profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In a step forward, Szakasits et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] tried to overcome this limitation by collecting the pure cytoplasm of feeding cells through micro-aspiration. But producing a sufficient amount of material for analysis using this technique is laborious. Moreover it works better on larger, well-developed syncytial cells as compared to syncytial tissues during the early stages of development. An alternative and promising technique for collecting pure cells is laser capture microdissection (LCM).</p><p>LCM is becoming a popular tool among cell biologists because it allows isolation of RNA, DNA, proteins and metabolites from a heterogeneous cell population. Current LCM techniques are based on two principles. In the &#x0201c;touch-free&#x0201d; approach, cells identified under a microscope are excised by a laser beam and removed from their tissue context by gravity or by catapulting them away with a photonic pulse. Alternatively, cells are fused to a plastic membrane and are subsequently removed mechanically from the remaining tissue (reviewed in Ludwig and Hochholdinger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]).</p><p>Successful LCM requires good morphological preservations of tissues. Furthermore, isolated nucleic acids (RNA or DNA), proteins or metabolites must be of high quality to ensure their utility for downstream applications. Therefore, tissue preparation is the crucial step towards successful RNA isolation of samples generated by LCM. Since LCM requires micro-sections of 2&#x02013;20&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m, samples must be fixed and embedded prior to sectioning and mounting them on the slides. During this multistep procedure, RNA integrity remains at high risk of degradation due to the presence of RNases. Samples for immuno-histological analyses are generally fixed in paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin to ensure well-preserved tissue morphology. In contrast, ethanol:acetic acid (EAA) solution is preferred for fixation in experiments involving RNA extraction because paraformaldehyde cross links with RNA and thus makes its recovery difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. After fixation the tissues are embedded either in paraffin at room temperature or in an optimum cutting temperature (OCT) medium at &#x02212;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C (cryosectioning). While OCT-embedded samples are sectioned through a cryomicrotome at &#x02212;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, the paraffin-embedded samples are sectioned at room temperature. Cryosectioning is often preferred over sectioning of paraffin-embedded samples because processing the tissue at a low temperature reduces the activity of RNases and increase yield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Nevertheless keeping the RNA intact during the various steps of the cryosectioning for LCM poses a challenge and entails fixing and processing tissues. For example, plant cells contain big vacuoles for water storage, which may form crystals because of fast freezing of samples during cryosectioning leading to the destruction of cellular structures. Similarly, it is challenging to maintain the histological preservation during cryosectioning so that the target cells can be distinguished from others cell types. Therefore a number of tissue fixation and embedding procedures have been developed to ensure optimised handling of tissues with different physical rigidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Nakazono et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] were the first to report application of LCM in plant samples by isolating the epidermis and vascular tissue cells of maize plants, which were subsequently used in microarray studies. Soon after, Kerk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] presented an RNA isolation technique using the paraffin-embedded sections of a variety of plant tissues. Further the LCM procedure has been applied to isolate syncytial material from soybean roots infected with cyst nematode <italic>H. glycines</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. These authors applied paraffin embedding to process the syncytial samples and showed that a number of genes are differentially regulated in these plants upon nematode infection. But the utility of this protocol for nematode-infected Arabidopsis roots remains questionable as it may lead to poor quality RNA extraction. LCM was also used to capture giant cells and isolate RNA induced by root-knot nematodes in Arabidopsis, rice and tomato during different stages of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However no protocol describing the isolation of syncytial cells from Arabidopsis have been described so far. In the present study we optimised the LCM procedure for the isolation of syncytial cells from Arabidopsis roots in such a manner that their morphology can be preserved and high-quality RNA can be isolated for downstream applications such as microarray analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><p>To assess the potential of a previously described giant cell RNA isolation protocol in Arabidopsis for its utility for syncytial samples, we grew Arabidopsis plants in KNOP medium and infected them with J2 nematodes of <italic>H. schachtii</italic>. Root segments containing syncytia were cut at 5&#x000a0;days post inoculation (dpi). The infected root segments were subsequently fixed in EAA (3:1) and processed for LCM as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, RNA was heavily degraded in these samples and was unusable for downstream applications (data not shown).</p><p>To identify the crucial step in which the RNA was degraded, we hand-dissected root segments containing syncytia at 5 dpi and isolated RNA at three different steps (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The subsequent quality analysis revealed that the RNA was already degraded before embedding in OCT. Hence sections mounted on the slides already contained deteriorated RNA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, b). Conversely the RNA isolated from syncytial tissues that were fixed but not treated for cryoprotection produced high-quality RNA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). We concluded that the cryoprotection procedure needs to be modified to obtain good quality RNA.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>An overview of influence of tissue fixation and embedding on RNA quality</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Method</th><th align="left">Fixation</th><th align="left">Cryoprotection in sucrose</th><th align="left">Embedding</th><th align="left">RNA quality</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">A</td><td align="left">Yes</td><td align="left">Yes</td><td align="left">Yes (OCT)</td><td align="left">Degraded</td></tr><tr><td align="left">B</td><td align="left">Yes</td><td align="left">Yes</td><td align="left">No</td><td align="left">Degraded</td></tr><tr><td align="left">C</td><td align="left">Yes</td><td align="left">No</td><td align="left">No</td><td align="left">Good</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>A, B and C refers to three different steps from which RNA was isolated.

For this, root segments containing infected tissues were cut and fixed in EAA solution followed by a direct incubation in 15&#x000a0;% sucrose solution for 3&#x000a0;h (low concentration sucrose-treated samples). These samples were then left overnight in 34&#x000a0;% sucrose solution. Alternatively fixed tissues were directly incubated in 34&#x000a0;% for 5&#x000a0;h (high concentration sucrose-treated samples). Subsequently, tissues from low- and high-concentration sucrose-treated samples were embedded in OCT, cryosectioned and used for RNA isolation. While the RNA from low-concentration sucrose-treated tissues was heavily degraded (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a), the sections from high-concentration sucrose-treated tissues showed high-quality RNA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Therefore these samples were further processed (mounting on slides, and removing OCT) to isolate syncytial sections through LCM.

The collected material can be used for a broad range of downstream molecular studies, for example, qPCR, RNAseq, microarray and proteomics. In contrast to animal cells the presence of a cell wall and large vacuole in plants necessitates modifications to preserve cell morphology and macromolecules, such as RNA and proteins. As the use of LCM in plant sciences expands, a variety of optimized protocols for specific cell-type harvest have been established. However in contrast to a typical plant cell with a large central vacuole, the cyst-nematode-induced syncytium is a distinctive structure surrounded by a thick cell wall that contains several smaller vacuoles. Therefore performing LCM on syncytial samples may necessitate certain modifications in existing protocols.</p><p>In this study we used a previously described protocol for LCM on giant cells induced by root-knot nematodes in Arabidopsis as a starting point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However when we incubated the samples in various sucrose concentrations, the RNA in the samples was highly degraded (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). In contrast incubating samples directly in a 34&#x000a0;% sucrose solution preserved the RNA integrity, indicating that RNase activity may not completely stop at lower sucrose concentrations. A higher concentration of sugar minimise the availability of water in the tissues, which may reduce enzymatic activities including that of RNase. The cryoprotective use of higher sucrose concentrations (20 or 30&#x000a0;%) has already been reported in animal tissues when performing LCM and immunohistochemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The use of an RNase inhibitor, for example, RNase later<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, maintains high-quality RNA; however RNase later<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> severely compromised the morphology of the sections in some reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Although the 34&#x000a0;% sucrose concentration significantly increased RNA quality, the morphology of the sections was strongly compromised. We reasoned that this may be due to direct tissue incubation in a higher concentration sucrose solution (34&#x000a0;%), which may result in a rapid loss of water and thus shrunk tissues. Indeed tissue morphology was maintained through longer vacuum infiltration and an overnight incubation in a 34&#x000a0;% sucrose solution (see &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>&#x0201d;). The slow intake of solution might have helped the cells maintain their shape.</p><p>After the morphology of the sections was satisfying, the embedding medium was removed completely by washing which is a perquisite for the laser beam to function properly. The commercially available OCT medium is water soluble and can be removed easily by washing with PBS buffer. However the root sections can also be washed away unless they adhere strongly to the slides. We tried membrane-covered slides (PET and PEN), which permit very fine dissection of target cells, and the targeted area can be catapulted as a single intact piece, but they proved very poor in holding root sections during the washing step. In contrast, Ramsay et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] used PEN slides for the LCM of giant cells from tomato roots, and Barcala et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] used Superfrost<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> positively-charged glass slides for giant cells in Arabidopsis roots. However we found that poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine-coated glass slides robustly anchored the frozen sections of 5-day-old syncytia.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that fixation with EAA and a direct infiltration with 34&#x000a0;% sucrose, prior to embedding in OCT medium generates syncytial samples with well-preserved morphology that are suitable to distinguish syncytial cells from uninfected surrounding tissue during LCM. Moreover, high quality RNA was extracted from LCM-processed syncytial samples, which was suitable for downstream applications such as microarrays analysis and RT-PCR. Importantly, we were able to analyse the RNA quality prior to amplification, which has not been shown previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Our protocol will help analysing gene expression during early stages of cyst nematode infection, which may help understanding genes and pathways that are important for nematode development. In addition, development of analytical tools such as syncytium-specific promoters will be greatly facilitated by application of this methodology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Tissue preparation and sample collection</title><p>10-day-old <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> plants were grown on KNOP medium and inoculated with 60&#x02013;70 juveniles of <italic>Heterodera schachtii</italic> as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].
