This differential expression was confirmed with RNASeq, which also suggested perturbations of aspects of T cell function and erythropoiesis.

While this is achieved in part by virtue of their complex life cycle that includes intra-erythrocyte cycling and periodic sequestration in various tissue compartments [<xref rid="pntd.0003978.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], it is also clear that <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection causes short- and probably long-term modification of host immune function. Molecular methods are shedding some light on the mechanisms behind these modifications. For example, it is now clear that exposed individuals generally do mount an antigen response to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> antigens that persists [<xref rid="pntd.0003978.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003978.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and that several biochemical pathways are engaged, including interferon and cytokine signaling, membrane lipid modification, and reactive oxygen species metabolism [<xref rid="pntd.0003978.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Host factors including genetic variation, both within and between populations, play a role in modulating immunity in malaria, as does the microbiome [<xref rid="pntd.0003978.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0003978.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>An important factor influencing the clinical course of disease is prior exposure to malaria. Adults and older children tend to experience reduced prevalence of malaria infection and have less severe symptoms [<xref rid="pntd.0003978.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003978.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Nevertheless the mechanisms responsible for host resistance to malaria are still poorly understood. As a prelude to evaluation of vaccine efficacy in a Colombian population, we recently carried out a challenge experiment in which we described the responses of immunologically na&#x000ef;ve and semi-immune individuals to deliberate infection with <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> through mosquito bites [<xref rid="pntd.0003978.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. All nine volunteers from a malaria endemic region near the town of Buenaventura were weakly positive for IgG antibodies to sporozoites or blood stage proteins prior to the experiment, and after challenge eight of them showed increased antibody titers against blood stages. Similarly, five of seven na&#x000ef;ve volunteers from the city of Cali converted to sero-positivity that was generally maintained for at least four months. While there was no significant difference in the time to first appearance of blood stage parasite assessed by thick blood smears (12 to 13 days in both groups) or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (around 9 days), the na&#x000ef;ve volunteers experienced classical early malaria symptoms, whereas the semi-immune volunteers were for the most part nearly asymptomatic, at least at the day of diagnosis when curative prophylaxis was administered [<xref rid="pntd.0003978.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>In order to begin to characterize the molecular basis for this difference in clinical course of disease as a function of prior exposure to malaria, we report here two types of transcriptome profiling of peripheral blood samples from the Colombian challenge experiment volunteers. First we used targeted measurement of a set of 96 highly informative transcripts by nanoscale Real Time PCR (RT-qPCR) [<xref rid="pntd.0003978.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in order to generate a time course of the infection transcriptional response. Second, we used RNASeq [<xref rid="pntd.0003978.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] on a subset of six volunteers contrasting baseline and incident malaria, to ask whether (i) there is a difference in immune profiles between na&#x000ef;ve and semi-immune individuals in the absence of infection, and (ii) patent infection results in a differential transcriptional response that may hint at the molecular basis of long-term immunity. We also contrasted our findings with those of cross-sectional studies, concluding that history of exposure is just one of many factors mediating host&#x02013;parasite interactions in malaria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Experimental design and ethics statement</title><p>The experimental design protocol of this research was approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRB) at the Malaria Vaccine and Drug Development Center (CECIV, Cali) and Centro M&#x000e9;dico Imbanaco (Cali).

[<xref rid="pntd.0003978.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] at six timepoints (Pre-challenge, day 5, day 7, day 9, Diagnosis (Dx) and month 4). The RT-qPCR was completed in three steps: (1) Total whole blood RNA was converted to single stranded cDNA using polyT priming of reverse transcription, (2) the 96 targeted genes were pre-amplified in a single 13-cycle PCR reaction for each sample following conditions outlined in the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol by combining cDNA with the pooled primers and EvaGreen Mastermix (Fluidigm BioMark), and (3) qPCR reactions were performed for each sample and individual gene on each sample on a 96&#x000d7;96 array with 30 amplification cycles. Average Ct value was calculated at a point in which every reaction is in the exponential phase to ensure accuracy and precision of amplification. In order to make the analysis more easily comparable with traditional transcript abundance measures such as those obtained with microarrays or RNASeq, each Ct value was subtracted from 30, setting missing values to 0. Since small Ct values correspond to high transcript abundance, this subtraction yields values ranging from 0 (no expression) to 30 (very high abundance).

After alignment, estimation of transcript abundance measures as fragments per kilobase of exon per million aligned fragments (FPKM) values was performed using Cufflinks [<xref rid="pntd.0003978.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

This analysis focuses on 9 common axes of variation that we detected in all human peripheral blood gene expression datasets that we have examined. They are related to 28 modules of co-expressed genes described by Chaussabel and colleagues [<xref rid="pntd.0003978.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and found to be dysregulated in various immune diseases, but which collapse into 9 larger Axes of transcripts that covary in healthy adults. Each axis includes from several hundred to several thousand genes that gene set enrichment analysis suggests are involved in particular immune functions, broadly speaking, T cell signaling (Axis 1), reticulocyte number (Axis 2), B cell signaling (Axis 3), and inflammation (Axis 5) or specific immune or physiological responses (Interferon signaling, Axis 7).</p><p>Blood informative transcript (BIT) axes analysis was performed by generating the first PC for the 10 genes that are most strongly correlated with each of the 9 Axes reported in [<xref rid="pntd.0003978.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Principal component one (PC1) for each of these 10 sets of BIT provide a summary axis score, to which all of the other genes in the Axis positively correlate, nominally with a Pearson correlation coefficient greater than 0.5 as listed in <xref rid="pntd.0003978.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>. This Axis score is then contrasted with respect to the covariates of interest (primarily time-point, location, and the interaction between them, but in exploratory analyses gender, parasitemia, and individual) using standard parametric t-tests or analysis of variance, or with linear regression.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Most statistical analyses of both the Fluidigm and RNASeq datasets were performed in JMP Genomics version 5 (SAS Institute, NC), starting with the Basic Expression Workflow, which performs principal components analysis (PCA), and computes a weighted total contribution of the covariates of interest to the axes (principal variance components analysis, PVCA). Linear regression was then used to assess the relationship between the individual covariates and PC, and/or analysis of variance was used to detect differential expression between locations or timepoints. We fit models with timepoint and location as fixed effects, and with individual as a random effect, in order to control for the effect of differential responses among individuals within each sample. No differences in the significance of the fixed effects were observed compared to models without individual, implying that this source of variation is minimal, and we report the significance of the full model.</p><p>A Benjamini-Hochberg 5% false discovery rate was used to select differentially expressed genes. Volcano plots contrast the significance (negative log10 of the p-value, NLP) against the fold difference (normalized log2 Ct or FPKM units) between specific conditions.

Axis 5 is related to innate immune signaling and neutrophil number, and seems to decline at Diagnosis, surprisingly, implying a mild reduction in inflammatory gene activity.

These results are consistent with previously observed stable maintenance of peripheral blood gene expression profiles in healthy adults. A caveat to this analysis is that it is possible that other genes not included in the targeted set of probes do change in expression prior to the diagnosis of parasitemia, or alternatively do not return to baseline after recovery.</p><fig id="pntd.0003978.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0003978.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Axis of variance analysis.</title><p>Each plot shows the differences in Axis scores at 6 different timepoints for RT-qPCR (<bold>A and B</bold>) and two for RNASeq <bold>(C-E</bold>); Blue solid point represents Cali, and red open circles represent Buenaventura.

An average of 15 million paired-end 100bp short read alignments to the human reference genome were obtained for each sample, allowing us to estimate transcript abundance for each of 6,154 genes. Analysis of variance was used to contrast gene expression relative to population and timepoint, and to assess the interaction between these two factors. <xref rid="pntd.0003978.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref> shows that 25% of the total variance was among individuals, similar to the Fluidigm observation, and that very little differentiation was seen between populations. However, just over one third of the variance was between Baseline and Diagnosis samples, implying a much greater response to infection than suggested by the RT-qPCR data, though it should be noted that when only contrasting the two most different timepoints, this contrast was expected to account for more of the variance.</p><p>The differential expression of Axes 5 and 7 was confirmed by the RNASeq data (<xref rid="pntd.0003978.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>), which also suggested divergence of Axis 2 (<xref rid="pntd.0003978.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). Individual variability in response was minimal, as inclusion of individual as a random effect in the models had no effect on the proportion of variance due to either the time-of-diagnosis or population sampled. Up-regulation of Axis 2 is likely to be a sign of elevated erythropoiesis since they are enriched for erythrocyte-related function [<xref rid="pntd.0003978.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and reanalysis of the dataset reported by Whitney et al. (2003) [<xref rid="pntd.0003978.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] shows that the genes in this axis are highly correlated with reticuloycte count, suggesting a mild physiological response to loss of red blood cell function even in the early stages of malaria. Interestingly, the increased resolution of RNASeq suggests differential responses of Axes 5 and 7 between the na&#x000ef;ve and semi-immune populations. Specifically, the neutrophil and TLR-signaling associated with Axis 5 is much weaker in the na&#x000ef;ve individuals (<xref rid="pntd.0003978.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>, solid blue points, p = 0.0008, though the location&#x000d7;timepoint interaction term is not significant, p = 0.13), whereas the induction of interferon signaling is variable in semi-immune volunteers (<xref rid="pntd.0003978.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>, open red circles), two of whom showed no response.

The reason is that these genes are even more highly upregulated in a subset of individuals, namely the na&#x000ef;ve (Cali) volunteers.

In other words, most of the genes showing an interaction effect were more strongly up- or down regulated in the na&#x000ef;ve than semi-immune individuals.

Another cluster of 23 genes, including the IL4R, IL6R, and IL7R and IL17R receptors, was upregulated at Baseline, particularly strongly in three volunteers (Cali 302 and Buenaventura 341 and 375). The third cluster of 19 genes, including TNF, IL1B and IL15, showed the opposite tendency, namely up-regulation at Diagnosis, particularly strongly in two samples (314 from Cali and 324 from Buenaventura). These results imply that there is strong co-regulation of the cytokine response and infection, but that this is not mediating the differential response between na&#x000ef;ve and semi-immune individuals.

Although the targeted expression profiling is less comprehensive and less sensitive than the RNASeq, it suggests that there is minimal transcriptional change in peripheral blood prior to patent infection, and that individual profiles return to baseline within a few months of parasite clearance. No obvious difference in the transcriptomes of uninfected na&#x000ef;ve and semi-immune volunteers was seen, but several hundred genes showed a stronger response in the na&#x000ef;ve individuals. We cannot however conclude that prior immune exposure is the only reason for this difference as other lifestyle factors that distinguish the inland city of Cali from the oceanside town of Buenaventura, (where there is likely a larger proportion of African ancestry) may also play a role. However, the data is strongly suggestive of a long-term modulation of the malaria immune response involving multiple molecular pathways.</p><p>Some studies have suggested that clinically immune individuals infected with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> show lower levels of inflammatory and regulatory cytokines, than individuals infected with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> malaria [<xref rid="pntd.0003978.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Nevertheless, the down-regulation of multiple genes related to innate immunity, inflammation, and neutrophil abundance, all correlated with Axis 5, observed here was unexpected. A large cross-sectional study of infants with malaria conducted in the West African Republic of Benin [<xref rid="pntd.0003978.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] documented a strong up-regulation of the same genes, although reanalysis of their data shown in <xref rid="pntd.0003978.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref> suggests that is only true in the presence of high levels of parasitemia. Even more surprisingly, the reduction in inflammatory gene expression was stronger in the na&#x000ef;ve than semi-immune volunteers. One possibility is that there is a transient reduction in relative neutrophil counts and inflammatory gene expression as the parasite first appears in the bloodstream, just as the lymphoid cells begin to amplify their response, and this is corrected as parasite levels increase and neutrophilia occurs a few days into the infection [<xref rid="pntd.0003978.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003978.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>An observation that is consistent with published data is the strong induction of an interferon response in association with blood-stage malaria [<xref rid="pntd.0003978.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003978.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It is unclear whether this induction was stronger in Cali or Buenaventura, since a couple of the Cali volunteers had unusually high baseline interferon-related gene expression captured by Axis 7. It does appear that a few of the semi-immune individuals did not mount an interferon response, consistent with the absence of overt clinical symptoms and implying that their immunological memory was able to deal with at least the early stage of infection without mounting the kind of major immunological response observed in the na&#x000ef;ve volunteers. This in turn implies that the presence of blood stage parasites alone is not the only determinant of whether or not an individual mounts an interferon response. The overall cytokine profile shifts reported in <xref rid="pntd.0003978.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> did not correlate with the clinical profile differences, which could be explained by the host immunity level that can vary due to the acquired immunity throughout repeated exposure [<xref rid="pntd.0003978.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Presumably larger sample sizes and longitudinal profiling during disease will identify associations between gene expression and physiological response, which is also likely to involve other tissues.</p><p>On the other hand, multiple classes of gene activity do seem to be differentially activated between na&#x000ef;ve and semi-immune volunteers. These include various signal transduction molecules, genes related to macrophage activity, and other cellular processes that are known to influence immune responsiveness including lipid synthesis and lysosomal function concordant with Portugal et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0003978.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] who suggest that as children develop exposure-dependent immunity to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>, the responses reduce pathogenic inflammation and boost anti-parasite mechanisms. The aforementioned study in Benin again provides a potential comparison, since it included the contrast between children in the city of Cotonou with the rural village of Zinvi&#x000e9;. Differences in human peripheral blood gene expression according to lifestyle are prevalent [<xref rid="pntd.0003978.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], but it is nevertheless interesting that, of the 32genes showing a significant interaction effect between timepoint and population in our challenge experiment, 12 were nominally differentially expressed between malaria patients from the two locations in Benin, compared with no more than three expected. <xref rid="pntd.0003978.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref> shows that Axis 1 (related to T-cell signaling) is down-regulated with high parasitemia, and consistently reduced in the village of Zinvi&#x000e9;. This Axis was not affected in our study, but collectively these observations of context-dependent alterations in gene expression provide further evidence that immune history is an important mediator of the differential clinical profiles observed among individuals.</p><p>There is also considerable interest in the use of gene expression profiling to identify genes that may mediate robust vaccine responses. Recent study reports on influenza and yellow fever have highlighted individual genes that are required for vaccine effectiveness, but have also suggested that baseline profiles of immune cell types may provide better predictors of antibody production [<xref rid="pntd.0003978.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003978.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Various properties of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> suggest that this organism may present a more difficult scenario for dissecting the molecular basis of vaccine responses, but we consider the results reported here to be an encouraging baseline establishing that differential responses to a malaria challenge can be detected by gene expression profiling. It will be interesting to see whether pre-immune exposure influences the molecular basis of vaccination with irradiated sporozoites in the next phase of this study.</p><p>This study shows that differential gene expression is particularly strong in na&#x000ef;ve volunteers in comparison to semi-immune individuals at the time of malaria diagnosis. One way to interpret this result is that it provides a molecular signature of tolerance of, as opposed to resistance to, the pathogen [<xref rid="pntd.0003978.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In the presence of chronic exposure, the host immune system moves toward an equilibrium where pathogen is tolerated by mounting a measured immune response, without requiring complete sterile immunity that would likely have a greater physiological impact on the infected individual. This in turn implies that gene expression profiling of lymphocytes can be used to identify the type and duration of the immune signals that may be biomarkers for vaccine immunogenicity, and to establish how semi-immune exposure modifies their activation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0003978.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Transformed Fluidigm data.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0003978.s001.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0003978.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Quality control metrics for RNASeq.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0003978.s002.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0003978.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>SNM normalized RNASeq data.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0003978.s003.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0003978.s004"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>List of genes correlated with each BIT Axis.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0003978.s004.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0003978.s005"><label>S5 Table</label><caption><title>Blood informative transcript (BIT) axes values for Fluidigm (A) and RNASeq (B) data.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0003978.s005.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0003978.s006"><label>S6 Table</label><caption><title>Magnitude and significance of differentially expressed genes.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0003978.s006.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the volunteers and families for consenting to participate.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pntd.0003978.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Wright</surname><given-names>GJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Rayner</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name>. <article-title><italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> erythrocyte invasion: combining function with immune evasion</article-title>. <source>PLoS Pathog</source>. <year>2014</year>;<volume>10</volume>:<fpage>e1003943</fpage><comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003943">10.1371/journal.ppat.1003943</ext-link></comment>
