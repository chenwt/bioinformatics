Prevention of neural degeneration and subsequent disability requires remyelination through the generation of new oligodendrocytes, but current treatments exclusively target the immune system. Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are stem cells in the CNS and the principal source of myelinating oligodendrocytes<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. OPCs are abundant in demyelinated regions of MS patients, yet fail to differentiate, thereby representing a cellular target for pharmacological intervention<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. To discover therapeutic compounds for enhancing myelination from endogenous OPCs, we screened a library of bioactive small molecules on mouse pluripotent epiblast stem cell (EpiSC)-derived OPCs<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. We identified seven drugs that functioned at nanomolar doses to selectively enhance the generation of mature oligodendrocytes from OPCs <italic>in vitro</italic>. Two drugs, miconazole and clobetasol, were effective in promoting precocious myelination in organotypic cerebellar slice cultures, and <italic>in vivo</italic> in early postnatal mouse pups. Systemic delivery of each of the two drugs significantly increased the number of new oligodendrocytes and enhanced remyelination in a lysolecithin-induced mouse model of focal demyelination. Administering each of the two drugs at the peak of disease in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of chronic progressive MS resulted in striking reversal of disease severity. Immune response assays showed that miconazole functioned directly as a remyelinating drug with no effect on the immune system, whereas clobetasol was a potent immunosuppressant as well as a remyelinating agent. Mechanistic studies showed that miconazole and clobetasol functioned in OPCs through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling, respectively. Furthermore, both drugs enhanced the generation of human oligodendrocytes from human OPCs <italic>in vitro</italic>. Collectively, our results provide a rationale for testing miconazole and clobetasol, or structurally-modified derivatives, to enhance remyelination in patients.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P4">As repair of damaged myelin may provide therapeutic benefit in MS and other demyelinating disorders<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, we set out to identify drugs that could be repurposed as remyelinating therapeutics. We selected the NIH Clinical Collection I and II libraries comprised of 727 drugs with a history of safe use in clinical trials, to test for maturation of OPCs into myelinating oligodendrocytes. Using mouse EpiSC-derived OPCs, we developed an <italic>in vitro</italic> phenotypic screen that accurately quantified differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes by high content imaging of myelin protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Two batches (&#x0003e;100 million cells each) of pure OPCs were generated from independent mouse pluripotent EpiSC lines of opposite sex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). EpiSC-derived OPCs shared virtually all defining molecular and cellular properties including gene expression profiles with <italic>in vivo</italic> isolated OPCs but provided the key advantage of being highly scalable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. For <italic>in vitro</italic> screening, the seeding density, endpoint assays, and DMSO (vehicle) tolerance were optimized in pilot studies to assure accurate and reproducible measurement of OPC differentiation in a 96-well format (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>).</p><p id="P6">For the primary screen, OPCs were treated with vehicle alone (0.05% (v/v) DMSO) as a negative control, thyroid hormone (a known OPC differentiation inducer) as a positive control<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, or drug dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 5 &#x000b5;M. After 72 hours, cells were fixed and labeled with antibodies to myelin basic protein (MBP) and the length and intensity of MBP labeled oligodendrocyte processes measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). These features were reliable indicators of alteration in cellular phenotype, as indicated by consistency and high signal to background ratio of positive and vehicle controls across all screening plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1d&#x02013;g</xref>). We then normalized the experimental data for the tested drugs against thyroid hormone (set value of 100) on a per plate basis. Based on this analysis, we identified the 22 drugs that enhanced oligodendrocyte formation greater than five standard deviations above DMSO treatment and also outperformed thyroid hormone in the measured parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Notably, one of the top 22 drugs was benztropine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist recently shown to induce OPC differentiation and remyelination<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">To validate and prioritize the 22 drug hits, the assay was repeated using alternate OPCs, reagents, and parameters to eliminate screen-specific artifacts (see Methods). Drugs were ranked by their dose-dependent ability to induce oligodendrocyte generation from OPCs without toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). To demonstrate reproducibility, an independent laboratory tested selected drug hits using distinct equipment, plate format (1536-well), personnel, and imaging/analysis scripts (see Methods). Of the 16 hits tested at the external screening site, 14 were validated as potent inducers of oligodendrocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2a, b</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We next tested whether the drug hits could promote the maturation of native OPCs in CNS tissue. Cerebellar slices were generated from postnatal day seven mice&#x02014;a time that precedes widespread myelination&#x02014;and treated <italic>ex vivo</italic> with drug or DMSO (vehicle) for five days and labeled with anti-MBP antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. We screened eleven of the top drugs and used an in house-developed high content analysis algorithm to rank them based on their ability to increase the extent of MBP+ aligned fibers in whole cerebellar slices. The &#x02018;high&#x02019; performing group consisted of four drugs that increased the number of MBP+ aligned fibers ~150% or greater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). We validated the accuracy of our high content screen by semi-quantitative western blotting of MBP protein isoforms in independent slice culture experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d, e</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">Structure-activity-relationship analysis revealed that the top hits from the primary screen segregated into two specific classes containing either a (1,3) diazole with mono-substitution at the 1-position or a sterane base structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3a&#x02013;d</xref>). We selected miconazole and clobetasol, the top overall performing hits in each of the imidazole and sterane classes respectively, for further mechanistic and functional testing after confirming that both drugs readily crossed the blood brain barrier in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Miconazole is a topical antifungal agent functioning through cytochrome P450 inhibition and clobetasol is a potent topical corticosteroid, but their functions in OPCs were unknown.</p><p id="P10">To test if miconazole or clobetasol enhance remyelination <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used a toxin-induced model whereby focal demyelinated lesions are generated in spinal cord dorsal white matter of adult mice by localized injection of lysolecithin (LPC). In lesioned animals, demyelination is complete within four days, after which OPCs are recruited into the lesion. Widespread remyelination does not normally commence until 14&#x02013;21 days post lesion (dpl), which provides a defined window from days 4&#x02013;14 to test the efficacy of drugs to enhance the extent and rate of remyelination<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Both miconazole (10 or 40 mg/kg) and clobetasol (2 mg/kg) treatment induced a marked improvement within the lesions of treated mice as compared to vehicle treated controls. At eight dpl both drugs induced a significant increase in the number of newly generated CC1+ oligodendrocytes in the lesion core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a, b</xref>). This was coincident with extensive MBP staining in the lesions of miconazole- and clobetasol- but not vehicle-treated animals at both eight and twelve dpl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Toluidine blue stained sections and electron micrographs demonstrated that miconazole and clobetasol each induced a striking increase in the extent of remyelination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c, d </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4a, b</xref>). At twelve dpl, lesions of vehicle-treated mice consisted mostly of unmyelinated axons (6% myelinated) while those of clobetasol- and miconazole-treated mice contained &#x0003e;70% remyelinated axons throughout the extent of the lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Analysis of myelin thickness relative to axon diameter (g-ratio) at twelve dpl revealed that miconazole- and clobetasol-induced myelin was thinner than intact myelin, a defining characteristic of remyelination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We also evaluated whether miconazole or clobetasol could promote precocious myelination during development, in the absence of injury or disease. We treated postnatal day two mice&#x02014;a time point that precedes widespread CNS myelination&#x02014;daily for four days with drug or vehicle. In miconazole- and clobetasol-treated mice, we found a significant increase in the number of CC1+ oligodendrocytes in the lateral corpus callosum as compared to vehicle-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). Additionally, we found a significantly larger portion of the corpus callosum was populated by MBP+ fiber tracts in miconazole- and clobetasol-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>). This suggests that clobetasol and miconazole enhance myelination in the absence of damage or disease. Collectively, the LPC demyelination and developmental mouse models demonstrate that miconazole and clobetasol each function to induce the differentiation of endogenous OPCs in the CNS and promote enhanced myelination.</p><p id="P12">To determine if the drugs were working at a particular stage of the OPC differentiation process, we seeded OPCs in differentiation conditions and treated them with either miconazole or clobetasol at different time points (0, 16, 24, or 48 hour), and assayed MBP expression at 72 hours. For both miconazole and clobetasol, the number of MBP+ oligodendrocytes present at 72 hours was dependent on drug treatment within the first 24 hours of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). In agreement with this data, treatment of differentiating OPCs with either drug for different durations (24, 48, 56, and 72 hours) induced a progressive, time-dependent increase in the number of MBP+ oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). These data suggest that both drugs function directly on OPCs early in the differentiation process. Additionally, neither drug showed a significant impact on astrocyte formation from OPCs <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting they likely function as direct inducers of oligodendrocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Muscarinic receptor antagonists such as benztropine and clemastine have recently been identified as remyelinating agents<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Therefore we tested whether miconazole or clobetasol function through the muscarinic acetylcholine pathway using functional cellular reporter assays of all muscarinic receptor subtypes (M1&#x02013;M5). Neither miconazole nor clobetasol inhibited any of the five muscarinic receptor subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). We then profiled whether clobetasol or miconazole biochemically inhibited the activity of 414 different kinase isoforms. Neither clobetasol nor miconazole inhibited any of the kinases tested, suggesting their activity is not based on direct inhibition of protein kinases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To explore the signaling pathways in OPCs influenced by these drugs, we performed genome-wide RNAseq and phosphoproteomic analyses on mouse OPCs treated with drug or vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6a&#x02013;d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Miconazole or clobetasol treatment altered OPC transcript expression and phosphoproteins within hours, and influenced expression of genes in signaling pathways involved in oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination. Clobetasol potently modulated genes downstream of multiple nuclear hormone receptors, including GR, which are known to be important regulators of myelin gene expression<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Since GR signaling is also known to enhance Schwann cell-mediated myelination in the peripheral nervous system<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, we tested if clobetasol&#x02019;s activity on OPCs was mediated by GR signaling. Treatment of OPCs with clobetasol for one hour increased the phosphorylation of GR at Ser220, an activating post-translational modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). RU486, a competitive GR antagonist, blocked clobetasol-induced GR phosphorylation and oligodendrocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e, f</xref>) suggesting that clobetasol&#x02019;s activity in OPCs is mediated through the GR signaling axis.</p><p id="P15">For miconazole, pathway analyses showed that proteins in the MAPK pathway were most strongly impacted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Figure 7a, b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Most prominent was the strong and sustained phosphorylation of both ERK1 and ERK2 (ERK1/2) at canonical activation sites which we validated by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). In mice, genetic loss of ERK1/2 in the oligodendrocyte lineage results in normal numbers of OPCs and oligodendrocytes but widespread hypomyelination, while constitutive activation of ERK1/2 results in a profound increase in the extent of remyelination after toxin-induced demyelinating injury<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. In contrast to miconazole, treatment of OPCs with clobetasol or benztropine did not induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). Miconazole treatment of a non-neural cell type, mouse fibroblasts, also showed no increase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, indicating potential cell type specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). PD0325901, a small molecule inhibitor of ERK&#x02019;s upstream kinase MEK, blocked the ability of miconazole to induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting that miconazole functions through a MEK-dependent mechanism in OPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>). We also treated mouse OPCs with voriconazole, a triazole-containing antifungal cytochrome P450 inhibitor with 80% structural similarity to miconazole, which failed to induce changes in ERK1/2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). This was consistent with the observation that voriconazole did not promote the differentiation of OPCs into oligodendrocytes, and taken together suggests that miconazole&#x02019;s effect on OPCs is independent of cytochrome P450 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7c</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We then assessed whether clobetasol and miconazole treatment would enhance the differentiation of human OPCs into oligodendrocytes. We generated human OPCs from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8a&#x02013;c</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. We then treated human OPCs with DMSO, clobetasol, or miconazole for 21 days followed by staining for MBP, imaging and high content analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8d&#x02013;g</xref>). Both drugs enhanced human OPC differentiation, with miconazole exhibiting the most reproducible and potent effects.</p><p id="P17">To interpret the potential impact of clobetasol or miconazole as therapeutics in immune-mediated MS models, we tested effects on immune cell survival and function. We found that only clobetasol, as expected from its known corticosteroid properties, altered na&#x000ef;ve T cell differentiation and both the proliferation and secretion of cytokines by PLP<sub>139&#x02013;151</sub> or MOG<sub>35&#x02013;55</sub> sensitized lymph node cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9a&#x02013;j</xref>). As such, only clobetasol, but not the solely remyelinating drugs miconazole or benztropine, showed efficacy in reducing disease severity in the immune-driven relapsing-remitting PLP<sub>139&#x02013;151</sub> EAE model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). The positive effect of clobetasol in this model resulted from its immunosuppressive effects as evidenced by the severe reduction of T cells within the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p><p id="P18">We also employed a second EAE mouse model, MOG<sub>35&#x02013;55</sub>-induced, in which the immune response is relatively controlled and disease pathology recapitulates chronic progressive demyelination. We used a therapeutic, rather than prophylactic, treatment paradigm to evaluate whether drugs could reverse, rather than prevent disease. Miconazole and clobetasol treated animals all exhibited a marked improvement in function with nearly all animals regaining use of one or both hind limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c, d</xref>). In contrast, vehicle-treated mice exhibited chronic hind limb paralysis over the treatment period. Benztropine treatment also resulted in functional improvement, but to a lesser extent than miconazole and clobetasol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c, d</xref>). Overt functional recovery of miconazole- and clobetasol-treated mice correlated with histological improvements in the spinal cord. Specifically, drug-treated mice showed restoration of MBP expression and a reduction in the extent of demyelination in the spinal cord, whereas vehicle-treated mice showed sustained areas of white matter disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 10a&#x02013;e</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Although clobetasol&#x02019;s immunosuppressive effect makes it challenging to directly evaluate its remyelinating potential in EAE, its consistent and robust induction of OPC differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>, and enhancement of remyelination in non-immune driven <italic>in vivo</italic> assays suggests that it serves a role in both immunomodulation and promotion of myelination. In contrast, miconazole did not modulate immune cell function and our data indicate that it acts as a direct remyelinating agent. Given the potential of miconazole as a remyelinating therapeutic, we contracted a separate laboratory to provide independent validation of its efficacy in the MOG<sub>35&#x02013;55</sub>-induced EAE preclinical model. The laboratory independently validated the preclinical efficacy of miconazole in MOG<sub>35&#x02013;55</sub>-induced EAE to reduce disease severity in treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Since the approval in 1993 of interferon beta-1b for the treatment of MS, therapeutic development has centered on the generation of additional immunomodulatory agents. Despite the effectiveness of many of these drugs to modulate CNS inflammation in MS patients, none of them prevent chronic progressive disease and disability&#x02014;largely due to their inability to stop or reverse the failure of remyelination in the CNS. We developed an advanced high throughput screening platform to discover effective remyelinating therapeutics. This pluripotent stem cell-based system provides unprecedented scalability, purity, and genotypic-flexibility to screen for compounds that enhance OPC differentiation and myelination. Using this platform we identified two FDA-approved drugs, miconazole and clobetasol, with newly discovered functions to directly modulate OPC differentiation, enhance remyelination, and significantly reduce disease severity in mouse models of MS. Since miconazole and clobetasol are currently only approved for topical administration in humans, significant optimization of dosing, delivery, and potentially chemical structure will be required to enhance the on-target pharmacology in OPCs while diminishing any potential off-target side effects. However, the ability of miconazole and clobetasol to each cross the blood-brain-barrier raises the exciting possibility that these drugs, or modified derivatives, could advance into clinical trials for the currently untreatable chronic progressive phase of MS.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S1"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="S2"><title>Mouse OPC preparation</title><p id="P21">OPCs used in this study were generated from two separate EpiSC lines, EpiSC9 (female) and 129O1 (male), using <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation protocols and culture conditions described previously<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.
