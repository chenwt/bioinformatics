Emergence in 2006 of a novel highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) isolate in China necessitated a comparative investigation into the host transcriptome response in tracheobronchial lymph nodes (TBLN) 13 days post-infection with HP-PRRSV rJXwn06, PRRSV strain VR-2332 or sham inocula. RNA from each was prepared for next-generation sequencing. Amplified library constructs were directly sequenced and a list of sequence transcripts and counts was generated using an RNAseq analysis pipeline to determine differential gene expression. Transcripts were annotated and relative abundance was calculated based upon the number of times a given transcript was represented in the library.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Major changes in transcript abundance occurred in response to infection with either PRRSV strain, each with over 630 differentially expressed transcripts. The largest increase in transcript level for either virus versus sham-inoculated controls were three serum amyloid A2 acute-phase isoforms. However, the degree of up or down-regulation of transcripts following infection with HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 was greater than transcript changes observed with US PRRSV VR-2332. Also, of 632 significantly altered transcripts within the HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 library 55 were up-regulated and 69 were down-regulated more than 3-fold, whilst in the US PRRSV VR-2332 library only 4 transcripts were up-regulated and 116 were down-regulated more than 3-fold.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The magnitude of differentially expressed gene profiles detected in HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 infected pigs as compared to VR-2332 infected pigs was consistent with the increased pathogenicity of the HP-PRRSV in vivo.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), the causative agent of PRRS in swine, is a member of the <italic>Arteriviridae</italic> family in the order <italic>Nidovirales</italic>. PRRSV causes highly significant economic losses to the swine industry worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] as a result of both reproductive failure (late-term abortions and stillbirths) in pregnant sows and respiratory disease (pneumonia) in nursery and grower/finishing pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Infection with PRRSV also predisposes pigs to infection by bacterial pathogens as well as other viral pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], as such, PRRSV is a key etiological agent of the porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). Clinical disease caused by PRRSV is highly variable, ranging from mild, subclinical infection to acute death of adult animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Differences in virulence have been attributed to numerous factors including host genetics, management practices, and virus strain heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Relatively little is known about the interactions of PRRSV and host cells. The lymph node is an anatomic site where the innate immune response and adaptive immune system interface. Tracheobronchial lymph nodes (TBLN) in swine drain the lung field and provide the focal structure that can reproducibly be identified. Although the TBLN contains a number of cell types, sampling this tissue allows study of direct and indirect effects of an infectious agent on the lung and cells within the lymph node.</p><p>In 2006 a unique syndrome with high morbidity and mortality was recognized in growing pigs in China that was originally known as porcine high fever disease (PHFD) due to its uncertain etiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Experimental infection of pigs in China with these novel viral isolates reproduced the clinical disease providing strong evidence for the role of PRRSV as the causal agent of PHFD. However, there was still a question as to whether there was some unknown agent in the PRRSV preparations that increased the severity of the clinical disease over what was expected for a &#x0201c;routine&#x0201d; PRRSV infection. This question was resolved when PHFD was reproduced in China with virus derived from an infectious clone of the JX143 PRRSV isolate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] demonstrating that PRRSV isolates with a common genetic motif had a causal role in PHFD leading to this lineage of virus being called highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV). We imported a plasmid containing a full-length clone of the 2006 JXwn06 HP-PRRSV isolate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] from which infectious virus (rJXwn06) was rescued. An animal study was conducted comparing the pathogenicity of HP-PRRSV isolate rJXwn06 with the North American prototype strain VR-2332 PRRSV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The objective of this report was to investigate gene expression profiles in porcine tracheobronchial lymph node (TBLN) during viral infection with HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 strain alongside of US PRRSV strain VR-2332 at a snapshot of 13 days post-infection using bioinformatics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Mapping short RNA-seq reads and estimating transcript expression levels</title><p>Genomic Short-read Nucleotide Alignment Program (GSNAP) was used for alignment and genome construction, and Cufflinks to determine if differential expression and changes in transcript abundance were statistically significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The RNASeq yielded 55,527,464 reads for the control, 43,263,207 reads for the HP-PRRSV, and 34,555,783 for VR-2332 libraries after quality trimming and excluding any reads less than 25 bp. Cufflinks was used to measure transcript abundances in fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM). The Cuffdiff output contained normalized FPKM for comparison between libraries (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). These values were used to calculate the fold change (log2 transformed) in expression between the experimental unit and the control.</p><p>Examination of the RNASeq data indicated that there were major changes in transcript abundance occurring in the PRRSV-infected TBLN-based unique transcripts [Cuffdiff output (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>)].

Transcripts up-regulated in both HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 and VR-2332-infected TBLN by &#x0003e; 9-fold and &#x0003e; 4-fold vs. control TBLN, respectively, were three serum amyloid A2 (SAA4) acute-phase isoforms, as well as gene ENSSSCG00000013369 F1S9C0_PIG serum amyloid protein (no HGNC annotation), that are expressed in response to inflammatory stimuli (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Other annotated genes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) that were up-regulated in HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 TBLN vs. control were resistin (RETN) which is secreted by immune and epithelial cells and participates in the immune response by increasing transcriptional events that increase expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]; three members of the S100 family (S100A9, S100A8, S100A12) of calcium-binding proteins localized in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of a wide range of cells, involved in the regulation of a number of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation, and mediators of inflammatory and protective anti-infection responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]; xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) a generator of reactive oxygen species and possible cause of hypoxia-mediated lung injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]; and peptidylarginine deiminase, type IV, (PADI4) which may play a role in granulocyte and macrophage development leading to inflammation and immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].

The genes up-regulated in the HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 infected pigs&#x02019; TBLN were associated in 18 networks: from biological networks with functions associated with cell death, antimicrobial responses and cancer, with the highest network score of 37, i.e. the likelihood of genes in this network would have approximately a 10<sup>-37</sup> chance of occurring randomly, and 21 focus molecules, i.e. the starting points for generating biological networks; to networks with functions associated with nervous system development and function, organ morphology and reproductive system disease with a score of 2 and 1 focus molecule. Many of the up-regulated networks related to cell death and inflammatory response functions fit with the results previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] where HP-PRRSV strain rJXwn06 caused severe disease, resulted in up to 100X higher abundance of virus and produced an exacerbated release of cytokines, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, when compared to Type 2 prototype strain VR-2332. Wide spread tissue damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and cell death were observed as predicted by up-regulation of cell-death associated genes (circled in orange in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) in the network representation of the mostly highly rated network for HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 by IPA. The down-regulated network functions in the HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 infected TBLN included activities associated with cellular function and maintenance, tissue morphology, metabolic disease, organismal development, carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry, post-translational modification, protein folding, developmental disorder, which may be associated with cell death and reflects a severe disease state. Similarly, the down-regulated network functions in the VR-2332 infected TBLN were associated with cellular function, maintenance, development and organization.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Ingenuity pathways analysis summary.</bold> To investigate possible interactions of differently regulated genes, datasets representing 568 genes with altered expression profile obtained from the RNAseq data for HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 were imported into the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Tool and the following data is illustrated: The network representation of the most highly rated network (Gene Expression, Cell Death, Lipid Metabolism).

PRRSV strains differ in their dysregulation of the immune response to infection and delay in development of a protective immune response in vaccinated pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. A higher number of significantly differentially expressed gene instances were detected in HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 than VR-2332 when normalized to control samples at a snapshot of 13 days post inoculation (dpi). As anticipated, some of the genes (e.g., resistin) and pathways identified would be expected to be involved in the host response to a severe disease. In the case of resistin, it would be expected that adipose tissue stores are being mobilized as part of the host response to infection, which includes a high fever typical of infection with HP-PRRSV. There are specific cellular proteins that regulate a protective immune response, for example the pro-inflammatory genes that were up-regulated to a greater extent in HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 than VR-2332 when normalized to control samples as observed when comparing the pathogenicity of HP-PRRSV isolate rJXwn06 with the North American prototype strain VR-2332 PRRSV. At 13 dpi HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 inoculated pigs had an interstitial pneumonia that was significantly more severe than theVR-2332 inoculated group which appeared to be convalescing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Future studies of these differentially expressed genes, their transcript abundance, protein level, and protein function will enhance our understanding of the interaction of PRRSV with the host. Identification of new virulence mechanisms of PRRSV may improve the prospects for rational design of more effective vaccines to limit viral replication and shedding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cells and virus</title><p>MARC-145 cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (EMEM, SAFC 56416C) with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

This was carried out with the construction of a RNAseq analysis pipeline (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) comprised of GSNAP for alignment and genome construction, and Cufflinks to determine if differential expression and changes in transcript abundance were statistically significant. Three files of transcriptome data from the sham, HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 and US PRRSV VR-2332 inoculated groups were aligned to the UCSC pig genome build using the GSNAP alignment program in preparation for differential expression analysis. The next step in the pipeline was to put the GSNAP output into the Cufflinks program and run it through three separate utilities or tools within the software package; Cufflinks, Cuffmerge, and Cuffdiff. First the three files were run through Cufflinks in order to assemble the aligned RNA Sequence reads into transcripts and estimate the abundances in FPKM of the paired&#x02013;end reads. The Cufflinks q-value was the false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p-value of the uncorrected test statistic. The q-value used in this study was 0.05. The significance status was &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; when p was greater than q after Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple-testing (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Cuffmerge was then used to create a single transcript dataset from the multiple reconstructions. Two runs were then conducted using the HP-PRRSV rJXwn06 vs. control and the US PRRSV VR-2332 vs. control datasets using the Cuffdiff program to test for differential expression and regulation amongst the two disease states.
