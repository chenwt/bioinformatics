Enhancer activity is associated with the production of tissue-specific noncoding RNAs, yet the existence of such transcripts during cardiac development has not been established. Using an integrated genomic approach, we demonstrate that fetal cardiac enhancers generate long noncoding RNAs (IncRNAs) during cardiac differentiation and morphogenesis. Enhancer expression correlates with the emergence of active enhancer chromatin states, the initiation of RNA polymerase II at enhancer loci and expression of target genes. Orthologous human sequences are also transcribed in fetal human hearts and cardiac progenitor cells. Through a systematic bioinformatic analysis, we identified and characterized, for the first time, a catalog of IncRNAs that are expressed during embryonic stem cell differentiation into cardiomyocytes and associated with active cardiac enhancer sequences. RNA-sequencing demonstrates that many of these transcripts are polyadenylated, multi-exonic long noncoding RNAs. Moreover, knockdown of two enhancer-associated IncRNAs resulted in the specific downregulation of their predicted target genes. Interestingly, the reactivation of the fetal gene program, a hallmark of the stress response in the adult heart, is accompanied by increased expression of fetal cardiac enhancer transcripts. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that the activity of cardiac enhancers and expression of their target genes are associated with the production of enhancer-derived IncRNAs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cardiac development</kwd><kwd>Heart failure</kwd><kwd>Gene regulation</kwd><kwd>Gene regulatory networks</kwd><kwd>Enhancers</kwd><kwd>Long noncoding RNA (IncRNAs)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p id="P3">The development of the heart and tissue remodeling that occurs in the adult heart during the response to damage are complex biological processes modulated by the coordinated spatiotemporal execution of cardiac gene regulatory networks (GRNs) [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Cardiac GRNs are hardwired by groups of evolutionarily conserved cardiac transcription factors (TF) including NKX2.5, MEF2c, SRF and GATA4 [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], which interact with target <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory modules to drive appropriate downstream gene expression. The functional interconnections between upstream signaling pathways, cardiac TFs and their target genes direct cell specification and differentiation, and ultimately cardiac morphogenesis. Moreover, cardiac GRNs are exquisitely sensitive to genetic and environmental signals, with perturbations of these networks being responsible for the full spectrum of inherited and acquired cardiac diseases. Compensatory maladaptive mechanisms, which take place in the damaged heart, result in an increase in cardiomyocyte size and fibroblast proliferation, leading to cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Importantly, hypertrophied cardiomyocytes are characterized by expression of a gene program reminiscent of that activated during embryonic development [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Although combinatorial TF binding at proximal promoters is important and has been relatively well characterized [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], the key information processing units and regulators of gene expression within the cardiac GRN are enhancers [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Enhancers are an enigmatic class of regulatory modules, which lie far from the transcriptional start sites of their target genes. They operate as information processors of temporal, spatial and environmental cues to specify and dictate GRN activity [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Enhancer function is thought to involve direct and indirect promotion of transcription at target gene promoters. Through direct interaction with the basal transcriptional machinery and indirect remodeling of the local chromatin environment at target promoters, enhancers potentiate transcriptional initiation and elongation [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There is also strong evidence to suggest that enhancer function requires chromatin looping to bring regulatory factors into direct physical contact with their target promoters. However, the biochemical mechanisms by which this might selectively occur are poorly characterized. Recent studies have shed light on this selectivity problem, demonstrating that active enhancers generate noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), and that these transcripts are functionally required for enhancer activity [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Importantly, enhancer-associated ncRNAs are dynamically expressed in response to various stimuli including chemical, hormonal, electrophysiological, p53-dependant, and differentiation inducing signals. These dynamic expression profiles correlated with both enhancer activity and downstream target gene expression [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Importantly, enhancer-derived ncRNAs play fundamental roles in targeting chromatin remodeling complexes to the appropriate gene promoters [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and thereby facilitate the formation of chromatin loops [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p id="P5">Enhancer-associated ncRNAs have been characterized in a limited number of cell types and contexts but evidence for function in complex developmental and pathological responses, particularly cardiogenesis and maladaptive myocardial remodeling, is lacking. Recently, the utilization of high-throughput epigenomic screens has made possible the identification of hundreds of <italic>bona fide</italic> fetal cardiac enhancers in both human and mouse [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Here, we provide evidence that some of these fetal cardiac enhancers are transcribed, generating ncRNAs during cardiogenesis both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Global transcriptomic profiling reveals that hundreds of enhancers generate novel multi-exonic and polyadenylated long noncoding RNAs (IncRNAs). Interestingly, ncRNA expression correlates with that of their predicted downstream target genes. Identified transcripts are specifically enriched and differentially expressed in mouse and human cardiac progenitor cells. To highlight the functional importance of selected transcripts, we demonstrate that target gene modulation is possible <italic>via</italic> knockdown of a specific enhancer associated IncRNA. Finally, the maladaptive reactivation of the &#x02018;fetal-gene&#x02019; program post myocardial injury is also accompanied by the re-expression of fetal enhancer-associated transcripts. The demonstration that cardiac enhancers generate functional cardiac enriched transcripts will have wide ranging consequences for our understanding of cardiac GRNs controlling cardiac development and disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S2"><title>2.

Results</title><sec id="S17"><title>3.1. Fetal cardiac enhancers are dynamically expressed during cardiac morphogenesis</title><p id="P21">To determine whether cardiac enhancers generated ncRNAs, we took advantage of a genome-wide epigenomic screen that identified 3000 mouse fetal cardiac enhancers in the embryonic day (E) 11.5 hearts based on cardiac specific enrichment of the co-factor p300 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Of the 3000 enhancers, approximately 130 were tested <italic>in vivo</italic> for &#x003b2;-galactosidase reporter activity, confirming that enhancer activity drives expression in the heart [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Eleven enhancers, named <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (mm)67; mm73; mm76; mm77; mm85; mml03; mml04; mml30; mml32; mm172 and mm256 were then selected based on several relevant criteria. The main criteria used for the selection were the proximity of these enhancers to key protein coding genes involved in cardiac biology, the cardiac-specific activity of enhancers when tested in a reporter transgenic assay, and finally whether enhancers confer subregion specificity within the heart. Therefore, six of these enhancers were proximal to genes encoding cardiac regulatory proteins such as Myocardin, Myosin light chain-2v, Tbx20 and Endothelin-1 (Edn1; <xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">Supplemental Fig. 1</xref>). Most importantly, these enhancers drove robust cardiac-specific activity in mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Embryo images obtained with each construct are available using the enhancer ID at the Vista Enhancer Browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://enhancer.lbl.gov/">http://enhancer.lbl.gov/</ext-link>; [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]). Finally, the selected enhancers also exhibited subregion specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). For example, mm67 exhibited activity only within the ventricles (LV and RV) and outflow tract (OFT), and not in adjacent atria (RA and LA), as visualized by &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity in sections of representative embryos. Primers for RT-PCR were then designed in the enhancers as demarcated by the p300 peak to generate products of at least 100 nucleotides. RT-PCR of enhancer sequences using total RNA isolated from E11.5 mouse heart, forebrain and limbs demonstrated the presence of enhancer-associated ncRNAs specifically within the heart (<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">Supplemental Fig. 1B</xref>). Importantly, expression did not appear to be a general feature of all active cardiac enhancers since additional enhancers (mm73, mm76, mm103 and mm256) were not able to produce a transcript in cardiac precursor cells (<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">Supplemental Fig. 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P22">To determine whether enhancer-derived transcripts were produced in a developmentally regulated manner, we proceeded <italic>via</italic> quantitative (q)RT-PCR to measure enhancer expression in the whole heart during development from E9.5 to post-natal day 10 (P10). This developmental period encapsulates all the major morphogenetic and cell fate determining events, including cardiac chamber specification (E9), maturation (E10 to E18), septation (E11&#x02013;E18), terminal differentiation and myocyte exit from cell cycle (P10) [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Expression profiling demonstrated that cardiac differentiation and maturation markers, Myh7 and MS1/ STARS were upregulated as expected during cardiac development (<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">Supplemental Fig. 1D</xref>) [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. All selected ncRNAs were dynamically expressed during development of the heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Enhancer expression coincided with different cardiac morphogenetic processes occurring at specific developmental stages. For example, mm77 and mm130 expression is associated with cardiac maturation and septation respectively. Putative cardiac target genes were also dynamically expressed with expression kinetics correlating with enhancer-associated ncRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The induction of the ncRNAs typically is coupled to expression of target genes. In some cases, enhancer expression appeared to be repressed once target gene reached maximal levels (see for instance mm67, &#x02212;85, &#x02212;130). Overall, these data demonstrated that enhancer-associated ncRNAs were dynamically expressed during cardiac development coinciding with both target genes and cardiac morphogenetic processes.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>3.2. Enhancer-derived transcripts are enriched in cardiac progenitor cells</title><p id="P23">To evaluate enhancer expression during cardiogenesis, mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were induced to differentiate using the hanging drop model [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">Supplemental Fig. 2A</xref>). This model recapitulates embryonic cardiac development <italic>in vitro</italic>, generating all appropriate cardiac lineages (<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">Supplemental Fig. 2B</xref>). We first examined the temporal gene expression patterns associated with pluripotency, cardiac mesoderm, cardiac progenitors and differentiated cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Upon differentiation, the pluripotency markers Oct-3/4 and Nanog were rapidly downregulated. This down-regulation occurred concomitantly with expression of Brachyury, Eomes and Mesp1. The three core cardiac transcription factors Nkx2.5, Mef2C and GATA4, which specify cardiac progenitors and drive the cardiac gene program, were significantly upregulated by days 3 to 6. This was followed by robust expression of the cardiac differentiation and structural proteins, Myh6 and Myh7. Six fetal enhancers were expressed in differentiating embryoid bodies (EBs), and demonstrated dynamic expression profiles correlating with cardiac differentiation. Enhancer ncRNAs were predominantly induced at day 6, corresponding to CPC stage and is associated with putative target gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). To confirm that enhancers were transcribed in cardiac progenitor cells, we took advantage of the EmGFP&#x02013;Nkx2.5 ES cell line [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which expresses EmGFP under the control of the endogenous Nkx2.5 promoter, allowing the purification of cardiac progenitor cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3A and B</xref>). EmGFP&#x02013;Nkx2.5 ES cells were differentiated and Nkx2.5 expressing cells were isolated at days 6 and 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). As expected, Nkx2.5 expression and Myh6 expression were enriched in EmGFP&#x02013;Nkx2.5 expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). In addition, enhancer-derived transcripts and their associated cardiac genes were also significantly enriched in EmGFP&#x02013;Nkx2.5-positive CPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p><p id="P24">To precisely determine stage-specific activation of our cardiac enhancers, we took advantage of publicly available chromatin state maps generated using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) in differentiating ES cells [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

Assessment of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 (associated with inactive and active canonical promoters respectively), and H3K4mel and H3K27ac (associated with poised and active enhancers) allowed us to analyze chromatin state transitions at the transcribed fetal enhancers during cardiogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">Supplemental Figs. 3A &#x02013; D</xref>). All enhancers were induced at the CPC stage, corresponding with enhancer transition from a poised (H3K4me1) to an active state (H3K4me1, H3K27ac). None of the expressed enhancers were associated with canonical active promoter states (H3K4me3), confirming that they represent distal regulatory elements and not previously unannotated promoters. Importantly enhancer-associated expression was coupled with enrichment of initiating RNA polymerase II (RNAP2; phosphorylated at serine 5), supporting the notion that active enhancers undergo transcription. In addition, we analyzed the presence of activating marks, <italic>i.e</italic>. H3K4me3 and initiating RNAP2, at the promoter of Endothelin 1, the predicted target gene of mm132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Interestingly, enhancer activation and transcription appeared to precede induction of its target gene.</p><p id="P25">The enrichment of enhancer-derived transcripts specifically in cardiac progenitor cells led us to postulate that these enhancers were under the control of cardiac-specific transcription factors. We therefore executed a pair-wise sequence comparison between mouse and human sequences to identify evolutionary conserved transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). All fetal enhancers were enriched with conserved cardiac TFBS, including GATA4, Nkx2.5, Mef2 and SRF motifs (<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">Supplemental Fig. 4</xref>). Two enhancers, mm130 and mm172, also contained additional T-Box motifs, which can be bound by the key cardiac mesoderm-specifying transcription factor Eomesodermin (Eomes). To evaluate whether these enhancers were sensitive to activation by transcription factors, we took advantage of P19CL6 mouse embryonic carcinoma cells [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], containing an Eomes gene fused to sequences encoding a mutated estrogen receptor binding domain (EomesER) for tamoxifen-induced nuclear translocation [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Upon tamoxifen activation, Eomes induces Mesp1 and Lhx1 expression and initiates a cardiogenic gene program in P19CL6 cells (<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">Supplemental Fig. 4A</xref>). In addition, mm130, mm172 and their putative target genes Tbx20 and Ednra were transcriptionally induced in the presence of tamoxifen, suggesting that these enhancers are downstream of an Eomes-dependant transcriptional axis (<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">Supplemental Fig. 4B</xref>). Conversely, none of the other cardiac enhancers, not containing T-Box motifs, were induced in the presence of tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">Supplemental Fig. 4D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>3.3.

We therefore utilized a previously executed genome-wide ChIP-Seq screen [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and determined the occupancy profiles of enhancer-associated co-activator proteins at orthologous human enhancers in fetal and adult human hearts. We observed a significant enrichment of p300/CBP at human orthologs of mm67, &#x02212;85 and &#x02212;130 specifically within the fetal heart indicating that these enhancers were active during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). To demonstrate regulatory conservation of orthologous human enhancers, the human mm130 sequence was isolated and tested in a mouse transgenic enhancer assay. The orthologous human sequence recapitulated the enhancer activity of the mouse sequence, demonstrating that human orthologous enhancers were functionally conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). In order to confirm that human orthologous enhancers were expressed, RT-PCR was carried out on total RNA extracted from human fetal ventricles and atria as well as from human Nkx2.5-positive CPCs isolated at gestational week 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">Supplemental Fig. 5B</xref>) [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Primers for RT-PCR were designed in regions contained within the enhancer as demarcated by the p300/ CBP peak in order to generate products of at least 100 nucleotides.

This activation is also associated with significant upregulation of Myocardin.

Global discovery of enhancer-associated IncRNAs during cardiac differentiation</title><p id="P28">Enhancer-associated ncRNAs are currently known to exist in several forms: a) bidirectional, unspliced, non-polyadenylated eRNAs [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; b) unidirectional, intergenic, spliced and polyadenylated long noncoding RNAs with a canonical promoter chromatin signature (H3K4me3) [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; and c) unidirectional, intra- and intergenic, spliced and polyadenylated multi-exonic long noncoding RNAs with enhancer-associated chromatin signatures (H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac) [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Since reverse transcription reactions were primed with random hexamers in initial experiments, we were not able to readily discern the nature of our enhancer-derived ncRNAs. To address this issue, we assessed transcription of the Poly(A)<sup>+</sup> fraction of the transcriptome using high-throughput sequencing (RNA-Seq). Total RNA was isolated from differentiating ESCs at day 0 and day 6 of cardiac differentiation, corresponding to pluripotent (d0) and cardiac precursor cells (CPCs, d6) (<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">Supplemental Figs. 2A and B</xref>). These temporal points were selected to allow the identification of ncRNAs being transcribed from developmental cardiac enhancers during cardiac differentiation. Furthermore, day 6 of ESC differentiation corresponds approximately to E11.5 in the developing heart, the temporal point at which our fetal enhancers were identified. Furthermore, enhancer-derived transcripts were maximally expressed at day 6 during ESC cardiac differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p id="P29">We also integrated ChIP-Seq data generated in a comparable directed differentiation system that recapitulated the step-wise differentiation of mESCs (ES) to cardiac precursor cells (CPCs) (<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">Supplemental Fig. 2</xref>) [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This facilitates the annotation of chromatin states at underlying genomic sequence and assigns ncRNAs as either promoter-(plncRNA, H3K4me3) or enhancer-associated (elncRNA, H3K4me1/ H3K27Ac) IncRNAs. Furthermore, this allows us to identify enhancers that are activated during cardiac differentiation (<italic>i.e</italic>. between d0 and d6), and couple activation with differential expression of associated elncRNAs. We generated paired-end 100 bp RNA-Seq reads of Poly(A)<sup>+</sup> selected RNA and, using TopHat [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], we mapped a total of &#x0003e;2 billion RNA-Seq reads to the mouse genome (<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">Supplemental Fig. 6A</xref>). Transcripts were reconstructed <italic>de novo</italic> from these data using Cufflinks [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and compared with UCSC gene annotations. To identify IncRNAs with high confidence, we considered only multi-exonic transcripts greater than 200 nucleotides in size, and discarded any that overlap with known mRNA exons on the same strand or that have predicted coding potential (<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">Supplemental Fig. 6</xref>; Coding potential score &#x0003c;4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). This analysis reconstructed 18,521 multi-exonic transcripts, of which 14,376 (3222 upregulated and 2881 downregulated comparing undifferentiated vs. differentiated ESCs) correspond to University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) annotated protein coding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs. 5A, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">Supplemental Tables 3, 4</xref>). Our IncRNA annotation pipeline identified 4145 multi-exonic IncRNAs. There were 1537 (244 upregulated and 297 downregulated) UCSC annotated IncRNAs and 2608 (311 upregulated and 806 downregulated) novel previously unannotated IncRNAs. Novel IncRNAs and UCSC IncRNAs were expressed at significantly lower levels than coding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Furthermore, to verify the non-coding nature of our novel IncRNA candidates, we calculated the Gene ID coding potential score for each transcript and found that these novel transcripts have minimal protein-coding potential, comparable to UCSC annotated IncRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p><p id="P30">To classify our identified novel and annotated IncRNAs, we examined their overlap with specific chromatin states characterized in differentiating ESCs at the pluripotency (ES), mesodermal (MES) and cardiac precursor (CPC) stages of cardiac differentiation [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. LncRNAs were classified as being associated with either a canonical promoter (plncRNA, H3K4me3) or an active enhancer (elncRNA, H3K4mel/ H3K27Ac). Interestingly, novel IncRNAs were more associated with active enhancers (57% elncRNAs) when compared to previously annotated UCSC IncRNAs (34% elncRNAs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). These findings demonstrate that globally enhancers active during development are commonly associated with the production of Poly(A)<sup>+</sup> multiexonic IncRNAs, supporting the notion that enhancer-associated transcription is a common feature of cardiac developmental enhancers. Recent studies have demonstrated that elncRNAs and plncRNAs exhibit significant differences in transcript abundance with plncRNAs typically more highly expressed [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We also find that plncRNAs are more expressed in differentiating ESCs (p = 0.003 <italic>vs</italic>. elncRNA) than elncRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>).</p><p id="P31">We then determined if cardiac enhancers identified in E11.5 fetal hearts were associated with novel multi-exonic Poly(A)<sup>+</sup> IncRNAs in ES cells. We identified one enhancer, mm85 that was associated with a novel IncRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>), while other enhancers were not. Considering that these enhancers generate a transcript, we suggest that they are likely to encompass the bidirectional non-polyadenylated eRNA class [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Since enhancer-associated transcription correlates with enhancer activity, we therefore proceeded to visualize chromatin state transitions occurring at all IncRNAs identified in this systematic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5H</xref>). A significant fraction of IncRNAs with active enhancer states exhibit exquisite stage specific chromatin state transitions during cardiac differentiation. This finding further supports the notion that cardiac developmental enhancer activity is correlated with the expression of associated ncRNAs. Finally, we find that expression of a significant proportion of elncRNA correlates with the expression of their proximal coding genes, in agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">Supplemental Table 5</xref>) [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These findings support the notion that enhancer-associated IncRNAs regulate the expression of target protein coding genes in <italic>cis</italic> during the cardiac differentiation process. To summarize, our integrated genomic analysis of differentiating ESCs has identified hundreds of IncRNAs associated with cardiac developmental enhancers.

Utilizing ENCODE ChIP-Seq data [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], we first demonstrated that four of the mouse fetal enhancers (mm67, &#x02212;85, &#x02212;130 and &#x02212;132) were associated in the adult mouse heart with epigenetic marks identifying active chromatin, <italic>i.e</italic>. enrichment with p300, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">Supplemental Fig. 7A</xref>). We also observed heart-specific occupancy by the transcriptional machinery (RNAP2 and DNasel hyper-sensitivity) at all four fetal enhancers. These enhancer signatures were only present in the heart and not in the liver (<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">Supplemental Fig. 7A</xref>) or other tissues (not shown), confirming the cardiac-specific nature of these regulatory sequences. To confirm that these epigenetically active enhancers were expressed, total RNA was isolated from the adult mouse heart and liver. RT-PCR analysis confirmed that these four enhancer produced ncRNA in the adult heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). In contrast, mml04 and mm172 were not expressed. Furthermore, mm77 was excluded of the analysis due the possible confounding expression of Myl2 within the mm77 locus. We then determined enhancer expression in two patho-physiological models of cardiac injury. We first used a myocardial infarction model obtained by left anterior descending artery (LAD) ligation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs. 6A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">Supplemental Fig. 7B</xref>). Fourteen days post-infarction, the myocardium was characterized by remodeling, <italic>i.e</italic>. increased heart weight (HW) to body weight (BW) ratio, left ventricular (LV) mass, and septal and LV wall thickness as well as decreased ejection fraction (EF) as assessed by echocardiography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">Supplemental Table 2</xref>). Total RNA was isolated from the border zone of infarct-ed region and corresponding region in sham-operated mice. Expression profiling <italic>via</italic> qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated a robust reactivation of the fetal gene program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>) including upregulation of cardiac markers of stress (ANP, BNP, &#x003b2;MHC) and pro-fibrotic genes (Col1, Tgfb1). Of the expressed enhancers in the adult heart, mml30 and &#x02212;132 were significantly upregulated post-infarction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). This induction correlated positively with the upregulation of their target genes Tbx20 and endothelin-1. Interestingly, both Tbx20 and endothelin-1 have been implicated in pathological cardiac remodeling post myocardial injury [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In contrast, mm67 and &#x02212;85, as well as their putative target gene Myocardin were not significantly regulated post injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). To evaluate whether enhancers demonstrated active transcription during the acute phase of the response to infarction, we measured expression of all enhancers on days 1 and 7 (<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">Supplemental Fig. 8</xref>). Enhancers were minimally activated at these early time points. Significant induction of mm132 and its target gene Edn1 was nevertheless observed (<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">Supplemental Fig. 8</xref>). Furthermore, mm85, &#x02212;67 and their predicted target gene, Myocardin, were all significantly downregulated 7 days post infarction (<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">Supplemental Fig. 8</xref>).</p><p id="P33">In a second series of experiments, we used a model of cardiac pressure overload obtained by transaortic constriction (TAC; <xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">Supplemental Fig. 7C</xref>). Seven days after surgery, the myocardium exhibited cardiac hypertrophy and reactivation of the fetal gene program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>). Again, pressure overload-induced activation of fetal gene expression was associated with induction of mm132 and its target gene endothelin-1. Endothelin-1 is incidentally one of the best characterized hypertrophic agonists post cardiac injury, responding to numerous cardiac stresses and modulating the maladaptive pathological response. In contrast, mm130 was not induced, and mm67 and mm85 were even downregulated after TAG</p><p id="P34">To determine the transcript structure and nature of the fetal enhancer-derived ncRNAs expressed in the adult heart, we utilized a recently published adult heart-specific IncRNA data set [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].

Utilizing this data, we found that in the adult mouse heart, two enhancers, mm85 and mm77, were associated with unidirectional Poly(A)<sup>+</sup> multi-exonic IncRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">Supplemental Figs. 9A &#x02013; E</xref>). These ncRNAs exist as multiple iso-forms and are derived from the plus (mm77) and minus (mm85) strands. These data suggest that the other expressed enhancers were likely generating non-polyadenylated enhancer-derived ncRNAs. Delineating the intragenic structure of the multi-exonic ncRNAs associated with mm67 and mm132 was difficult to assess as our analysis is compromised by the presence of the parent coding gene transcripts (<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">Supplemental Fig. 9C</xref>).

Knockdown experiments were performed in P19CL6 mouse embryonic carcinoma cells. Transfection of P19CL6 cells with shMM85-1 and shMM85-2, but not control shRNAi, reduced the enhancer transcript by approximately 80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>). The predicted target gene of mm85, Myocardin, was also significantly downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>), demonstrating that mm85 enhancer derived IncRNA was required for Myocardin expression. Since many protein-coding genes are known to be regulated by multiple enhancers, we also characterized the mm67 enhancer, which is located within the Myocardin gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). Upon mm85 ncRNA knockdown, the mm67 ncRNA was upregulated approximately two fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>). Importantly, the more proximal protein coding gene, Map2k4, which is not a predicted target of mm85 based on its poor cardiac specificity, was not affected by mm85 ncRNA knockdown. Considering that the mm85-associated IncRNA is also expressed in the adult heart and modulated concomitantly with myocardin 7 days post infarction, we wanted to confirm that the mm85 IncRNA regulated myocardin in differentiated cardiomyocytes (CMs). As an experimental model, we used isolated neonatal mouse CMs. Cells were transfected with modified antisense oligonucleotides (GapmeRs) targeting mm85 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7D</xref>). The associated transcript was reduced by greater than 80%. Myocardin was again significantly downregulated in a specific manner whereas Map2k4 remained unaffected.

Identification and characterization of cardiac enhancers are therefore essential to decipher the molecular basis of cardiogenesis and pathological remodeling [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A number of important recent studies have attempted to address this issue, utilizing genome-wide epigenomic screens to identify fetal and adult cardiac enhancers [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Despite this progress, a physiologically relevant annotation and analysis is still lacking. Considering the recent identification of a novel class of enhancer-associated regulatory ncRNAs that are essential for enhancer function [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], we set out to determine whether cardiac enhancers are transcribed and generate cardiac-specific ncRNAs. Here, we provide first evidence that <italic>bona fide</italic> fetal cardiac enhancers are transcribed dynamically during cardiac development and disease. This highly regulated expression, both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, is consistent with expression kinetics of enhancer associated ncRNAs in other cellular systems [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It also supports the notion for these transcripts being functionally important rather than artifacts or transcriptional noise. Fetal enhancer ncRNAs are expressed in a cell and tissue specific manner, correlating with the activity of the enhancer and the expression of the predicted cardiac enriched target genes [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both mouse and human enhancer-associated ncRNAs are highly enriched in fetal cardiac progenitor cell populations and that a significant fraction of the intergenic multi-exonic poly(A)<sup>+</sup> IncRNAs identified in these cells are derived from active developmental enhancers. Importantly, very-deep sequencing allowed us, to probe the association and presence of such enhancer-derived transcripts at an unprecedented level in differentiating ESCs. Importantly, we have included in this analysis only transcripts with no predicted coding potential based on <italic>in silico</italic> determination (Gene ID score &#x0003c; 4). Nevertheless, we cannot formally exclude that some of these IncRNAs might be translated into small peptides under particular conditions. This warrants further investigation. Finally, we demonstrate that the reactivation of the fetal gene program post myocardial stress is also accompanied by the re-expression of fetal enhancers. Interestingly our group has recently profiled and characterized the long noncoding transcriptome in the adult mouse heart following myocardial infarction [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Notably, the vast majority of novel multi-exonic unidirectional IncRNAs that were identified are associated with adult heart-specific cardiac enhancers, comparable to our observations here in ESCs differentiating towards the cardiogenic lineage. Furthermore, the differentially modulated fraction of IncRNAs post infarction, was even more enriched with cardiac enhancer states, suggesting that cardiac enhancer IncRNAs are required for the global transcriptional reprogramming that underpins maladaptive remodeling and subsequent transition to heart failure.</p><p id="P38">Many evolutionary conserved adult cardiac enhancers exhibit RNAP2 occupancy in the mouse heart. Furthermore, thousands of recently discovered novel cardiac enhancers identified in differentiating mES cells (at cardiac progenitor and cardiomyocyte stage) are associated with initiating RNAP2 when enhancers are in an active state (H3K4me1 and H3K27ac), supporting the notion that enhancer-associated transcription is a common feature of cardiac enhancers. Previously characterized enhancer ncRNAs have been demonstrated to compose two functionally and structurally diverse ncRNA classes. The so-called enhancer-RNA (eRNA) class are unspliced, non-polyadenylated and bidirectionally transcribed [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].

To determine which class the enhancer-associated ncRNAs described in the present study represent, we executed RNA-Seq on Poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA derived from differentiating mouse ESCs and integrated this with publicly available ChlP/RNA-Seq data sets [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. <italic>Ab initio</italic> transcript reconstruction identified novel, unidirectional, Poly(A)<sup>+</sup> and multi-exonic ncRNAs mapping to mm85 and mm77. Interestingly, both transcripts were associated with different chromatin states. Mm77 was enriched with H3K4me3 at its transcription start site, rendering it similar to intergenic lincRNAs [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and enhancing IncRNAs [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This is also consistent with mm77 potentially representing an alternative TSS for the Myl2 gene itself.

Extending this conclusion, we demonstrate globally that numerous developmental enhancers are associated with unidirectional multi-exonic IncRNAs. The very-deep sequencing approach allowed us to identify hundreds of previously unannotated novel IncRNAs derived from these active enhancers.

LncRNAs are more cell-specific in their expression compared to protein coding mRNAs [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. They function as molecular scaffolds, targeting epigenetic and chromatin remodeling complexes to their correct geno-mic loci [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Analogous to the enhancer-derived IncRNA HOTTIP [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and to activating IncRNAs [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the cardiac enriched IncRNAs described herein could potentiate chromatin looping between enhancer sequences and cardiac-specific gene promoters. Interestingly, many IncRNAs have been shown to interact with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), known to regulate histone methylation [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Two recent studies have implicated this complex in epigenetic programming in cardiac precursor cells, being critical for cardiac specification, development and adult myocardial adaptation to stress [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. It would be of interest to determine what proportion of our newly identified enhancer associated IncRNAs are also able to interact with and target PRC2 in a cardiac developmental specific manner, akin to the regulatory roles conferred by the cardiogenic IncRNAs, Braveheart and Fendrr [<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p id="P40">We also demonstrate that enhancer-associated ncRNA expression is regulated in pathophysiological models of heart disease <italic>in vivo</italic>. These data provide a foundation for the functional annotation of the cardiac-enriched IncRNA transcriptome and suggests that many of these noncoding transcripts may encompass the enhancer ncRNA class. Furthermore, the cardiac enhancers analyzed in this study are highly specific to temporal and spatial cues. This is evidenced by their spatial domains of activity in the developing heart as well as their temporal activation kinetics during <italic>in vitro</italic> cardiogenesis and in response to pathophysiological stimuli. Since cardiac enhancer ncRNAs exhibit significant cell-specific and context-dependant expression [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], this renders them ideal candidates for therapeutic approaches in the heart. Indeed, as demonstrated for mm85 and SMAD7-lncRNA, it is possible to modulate target gene expression <italic>via</italic> enhancer-associated ncRNA manipulation. In this context, quantitative profiling of cardiac enhancer-associated ncRNAs can provide exquisite insights into cardiac enhancer activity and more globally into the regulatory state of the cardiac GRN during various cardiogenic processes. Finally, it is important to note that the existence of functional enhancer-associated ncRNAs radically alters also the way we conceptualize genetic variations. Indeed, the vast majority of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) associated with cardiac pathologies and cardiovascular risks reside in noncoding sequences [<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. It is assumed that SNVs within noncoding regulatory elements impact upon transcription factor binding motifs [<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], However, a number of SNVs were actually found in the human orthologs of some of the mouse cardiac enhancers characterized in the present study (data not shown). Our findings therefore demonstrate that we should also consider the impact of these noncoding SNVs on the expression, structure and function of enhancer-derived IncRNAs.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN2"><p id="P47">Supplementary data to this article can be found online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.08.009">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yjmcc.2014.08.009</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn id="FN3"><p id="P48"><bold>Disclosure statement</bold></p><p id="P49">None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ack id="S24"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p id="P50">We are grateful to Keith Harshman and Genomic Technologies Facility, University of Lausanne, Switzerland facility for support and sequencing.
