One aspect of this is the deposition of fat in the muscle and backfat, which is associated with growth rate, meat quality, and reproductive performance[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Backfat thickness is highly correlated with body fat radio, carcass cross-sectional fat area ratios, and intramuscular fat, so is a good indicator of fat deposition in pigs
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Therefore, the selection of backfat thickness using B-mode real-time ultrasound is a practical and economical method in pig breeding for increasing feeding efficiency, carcass value, and consumer acceptance of pork
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Because of the increasing problem of human obesity worldwide, it is beneficial to regulate fat deposition in pig breeding through molecular markers. Additionally, their similarity to humans in body size and other physiological/anatomical features, including their innate tendency to over consume food, means that pigs are a good animal model for studying obesity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The extent of fat deposition can be determined by triacylglycerol synthesis and storage, lipid mobilization, and fatty acid oxidation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The liver is one of the most important organs to regulate appetite and body weight in pigs, as well as playing a key role in regulating several metabolic processes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In pigs, <italic>de novo</italic> cholesterol synthesis and fatty acid oxidation mainly take place in the liver
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Lipid hydrolysis in adipose tissue results in free fatty acid, which is combined with plasma albumin then transported to the liver for use as an energy source through oxidation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>RNA-Seq technology for transcriptome profiling has previously been used to explore the transcriptome of pig liver tissue. Such transcriptomes were recently compared between a full-sibling (full-sib) pair of F2 females from a White Duroc &#x000d7; Erhualian resource population with extreme phenotypes in growth and fat deposition
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Other comparisons include a backcross of two female groups (H and L) with extreme intramuscular fatty acid composition (25% Iberian &#x000d7;75% Landrace)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and Duroc &#x000d7; F2 (Leicoma &#x000d7; German Landrace) cross pigs with divergent skatole levels in backfat
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Although several studies have previously attempted to identify the genes and pathways involved in fatty traits in the liver, to our knowledge, they either lacked sufficient RNA-Seq liver samples or did not take into account the effect of different genetic background noise when analyzing liver regulation.</p><p>The Songliao black pig is a Chinese domestic breed with powerful stress resistance and good reproductive and fat deposition capabilities. It is therefore a good model for studying fatty deposition. In the present study, we used RNA-Seq to obtain the liver transcriptomes of two full-sib Songliao black pigs with a high variation in backfat thickness. The main aim of this study was to elucidate the genes and pathways involved in lipid metabolism in liver tissue using RNA deep sequencing technology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Experimental design, animals, and phenotypes</title><p>The Songliao black female pig population (average age, 217 (range, 216&#x02013;218) days; average live weight, 100 kg (range, 92.5-116.4 kg) was housed in consistent and standard environmental conditions with natural, uncontrolled room temperature and light. Animals were fed three times a day and had access to water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Pedigree information was available for all animals. Live backfat thickness was measured on the last 3/4 rib using B-mode real-time ultrasound (HS1500, Honda, Japan). We analyzed a total of 53 individuals with full/half-sibs for backfat thickness to identify pairs with two divergent phenotypes. To minimize the noise of different genetic back grounds, full-sibs were selected as a priority.</p><p>We set out to compare transcriptome changes between two groups with a high variation in backfat thickness: pigs with higher backfat thickness (BH) and those with lower backfat thickness (BL) which had a backfat thickness 2&#x02013;3 times lower than that of BH pigs. The chosen animals also had to have a similar backfat thickness within the same group (BH/BL) after adjustment for live body weight. Based on our criteria, experimental samples were made up of two pairs of pigs with extreme backfat thickness differences, both of which were full-sibs.</p><p>The chosen pigs were slaughtered according to guidelines for the ethical use and treatment of animals in experiments in China. Liver tissue was separated and stored in liquid nitrogen until analyzed. Total liver RNA was extracted using the total RNA extraction Kit (Bioteke, China) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations. The quality of total RNA was assessed by the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>mRNA library construction and sequencing</title><p>mRNA was isolated from total RNA samples using oligo (DT) magnetic beads (Invitrogen, USA). Purified mRNA was first fragmented by the RNA fragmentation kit (Ambion, USA), then a one paired-end library was prepared for each sample according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. mRNA libraries were individually sequenced for foursamples (two from each of the BH and BL group) using the Illumina High-seq 2000 sequencing system. The libraries were sequenced using a multiplexed paired-ends protocol with 180 bp of data collected per run. The average insert size for the paired-end libraries was 180 bp. A total of four paired-end mRNA libraries were constructed individually for four liver samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Mapping and counting reads</title><p>Quality control and reads statistics were determined using FASTQC (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). All reads were trimmed 20-bp from the 5&#x02032; end according to the reads quality distributions. After removal of the sequencing adapt and low-complexity reads, all RNA-Seq reads were mapped on the reference pig genome (Sscrofa10.2) using TopHat v2.0.1 software
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] with default parameters. The annotation database Ensembl Genes v67 was used as a reference. Additionally, the intersect from BED Tools was used to count the number of reads mapping to exons, introns, and intergenic positions in the genome
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The reads count was measured using easy RNASeq software
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] to quantify the raw reads mapped on each gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Differential expression and novel transcript analysis</title><p>The trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) was used to normalize gene expression levels
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. After normalization, the NOISeq package implanted in the R computation environment was used to detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between two groups
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This method infers the noise distribution from the data and performs pair wise comparisons of the samples to identify DEGs. To measure expression level changes between two conditions, NOISeq takes into consideration two statistics: M(the log<sub>2</sub>-ratio of the two conditions) and D(the absolute value of the difference between conditions). The probability thresholds were <italic>P</italic> &#x02265; 0.8 and the TMM value in the lower expressed sample was &#x02265;1. The higher the probability, the greater the change in expression between the two groups. Using a probability threshold of 0.8 means that the gene is 4 times more likely to be differentially expressed than non-differentially expressed
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Novel transcripts, differentially expressed spliced transcripts, and primary transcripts were also detected using the Cufflinks suite of software for RNA-Seq

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], 71.42&#x02013;77.75%
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and 43&#x02013;84%
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Additionally, the percentage of reads within exons was higher than in previous studies, indicating that our results are more effective and credible.</p><p>Few studies have investigated how the liver transcriptome affects fat deposition. Our current gene expression analyses show that DEGs and pathways may play very important roles in this, and that genes involved in material metabolism and fatty acid transport are more active in the fatter groups of animals. These findings are consistent with those of previous studies. Previously, the expression levels of <italic>CA3</italic>, <italic>SERPINA6</italic>, <italic>GATM</italic>, <italic>GSTA2</italic>, and <italic>ALAS1</italic> were also found to be significantly different between the two groups
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. <italic>CA3</italic> is associated with the internal fat rate and backfat thickness ofthe pig
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], while <italic>SERPINA6</italic> within the quantitative trait loci is associated with cortisol levels, fat, and muscle content, so can be considered a key regulator of obesity susceptibility
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. These findings indicate that <italic>CA3</italic> and <italic>SERPINA6</italic> are strongly associated with fatty traits.</p><p>It is noteworthy that several DEGs identified in the present study (<italic>FABP-1</italic>, <italic>LCN2</italic>, <italic>PLIN2</italic>, <italic>CYP1A1</italic>, <italic>CYP1A2</italic>, <italic>CYP2A6</italic>, and <italic>CYP26A1</italic>) are involved in lipid metabolism. As a member of the family of fatty acid-binding proteins, <italic>FABP-1</italic> was expressed in all 12 tissues studied in a previous investigation, but transcript levels were more abundant in the liver and small intestine
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. FABP-1 is involved in the transport of fatty acids to the site of &#x003b2;-oxidation, as well as the synthesis of triacylglycerol and phospholipids. It is also shown to interact with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)&#x003b1;, which regulates fatty acid catabolism
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Compared with leaner pigs, <italic>FABP</italic> mRNA and protein levels were expressed at higher levels in the muscle of fatter animals
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In the present study, <italic>FABP-1</italic> was up-regulated in the liver samples of BH pigs compared with BL. Consistent with our results, <italic>FABP-1</italic> was also up-regulated in obese ob/ob mice compared with controls
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], suggesting that it&#x02019;s increased expression may enhance fatty acid transport.</p><p>The adipokine lipocalin 2 (LCN2) is a member of the lipocalin family that transports small lipophilic ligands and is highly expressed by fat cells both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Levels of <italic>LCN2</italic> mRNA are dramatically increased in the adipose tissue and liver of ob/ob mice, while reducing <italic>LCN2</italic> expression leads to a decrease in <italic>PPAR&#x003b3;</italic> expression
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, we found that <italic>LCN2</italic> was down-regulated in the BH group compared with the BL group of pigs. Perilipin 2 (PLIN2) is a cytosolic protein that promotes the formation and stabilization of intracellular lipid droplets, which are organelles involved in the storage of lipid depots. <italic>PLIN2</italic> polymorphisms have been associated with carcass traits including backfat thickness in pigs
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], while increased <italic>PLIN2</italic> mRNA expression was detected in the skeletal muscle of pigs with higher intermuscular fat
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Our results contradict this by revealing a lower <italic>PLIN2</italic> mRNA expression level in the livers of pigs with higher backfat thickness. Finally, <italic>CYP1A1, CYP1A2</italic>, <italic>CYP2A6</italic>, and <italic>CYP26A1</italic> belong to the highly diverse CYP450 super family, and also showed a differential expression pattern in the current study. CYPs have been shown to play critical roles in catalyzing metabolism reactions and in the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Because several differences appear to exist in observed expression levels between studies, further investigation into expression differences of these genes is warranted to elucidate their role in fat deposition.</p><p>The present study identified more pathways that were up-regulated than down-regulated in the fatter group of pigs. Most of these pathways are related to the metabolism of substances such as xenobiotics, drugs, retinol, and tryptophan. The retinoid metabolism pathway has previously been shown to be up-regulated in the liver. Retinoid is crucial for most forms of life, and many studies have identified an association between retinoid and lipid metabolism
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Retinoids regulate metabolism by activating specific nuclear receptors, including the retinoic acid receptor and the retinoid X receptor, an obligate heterodimeric partner for other nuclear receptors including PPARs. This helps to coordinate energy balance
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and suggests that the liver has a larger burden in fatter compared with leaner pigs.</p><p>STRING analysis in the present study indicated that genes regulating metabolism influence those related to heat stress. Heat stress was previously shown to affect lipid peroxidation, causing serious damage to membrane lipids, lipoprotein, and other lipid-containing structures
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In pigs, body weight is positively correlated with heat stress
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], but our current results show that mRNA levels of genes related to heat stress are down-regulated in the livers of fatter compared with leaner pigs. Future investigations into the interaction between body weight and heat stress may therefore identify novel methods to show how body weight affects healthy individuals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study undertook transcriptome analysis between two groups of Songliao black pigs with different backfat thicknesses. A total of 92 DEGs were identified between BH and BL groups. In concordance with the phenotypic differences, these genes belonged to pathways and gene networks related to lipid metabolism, regulation, and transport. Additionally, the identified DEGs related to heat stress could provide a new method of understanding and combating obesity. Our findings will be of use in understanding liver lipid regulation and in the design of new selection strategies to improve pig production.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BH: Group with higher backfat thickness; BL: Group with lower backfat thickness; DAVID: Database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery; DEG: Differentially expressed gene; Full-sib: Full-sibling; GO-BP: Gene ontology biological processes; GO-CC: GO cellular component; GO-MF: GO molecular function; LCN2: Lipocalin 2; PLIN2: Perilipin 2; PPAR: Proliferator-activated receptor; TMM: Trimmed mean of M-values; RT: Reverse transcriptase; STRING: Search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>KX carried out the experiment and drafted the manuscript.
