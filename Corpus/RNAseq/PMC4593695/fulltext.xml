Recently, concerns have been raised regarding the concordance of data derived from the two techniques. Using cDNA libraries derived from normal human foreskin fibroblasts, we measured changes in transcript abundance as cells transitioned from proliferative growth to quiescence using both DNA microarrays and RNA-seq. The internal reproducibility of the RNA-seq data was greater than that of the microarray data. Correlations between the RNA-seq data and the individual microarrays were low, but correlations between the RNA-seq values and the geometric mean of the microarray values were moderate. The two technologies had good agreement when considering probes with the largest (both positive and negative) fold change (FC) values. An independent technique, quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), was used to measure the FC of 76 genes between proliferative and quiescent samples, and a higher correlation was observed between the qRT-PCR data and the RNA-seq data than between the qRT-PCR data and the microarray data.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>RNA-seq</kwd><kwd>microarrays</kwd><kwd>transcriptome analysis</kwd><kwd>fibroblasts</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source>Saskatchewan Innovation Fund

Currently, ArrayExpress and Gene Expression Omnibus, the two major online repositories of transcriptome data, each contain nearly a million DNA microarray datasets [<xref rid="RSOS150402C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS150402C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Despite their widespread use, however, concerns have been raised regarding the reproducibility of DNA microarray experiments across microarray platforms, across laboratories and even within the same laboratory [<xref rid="RSOS150402C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSOS150402C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has recently become popular as an alternative method for measuring transcript abundance [<xref rid="RSOS150402C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Like the DNA microarray, RNA-seq is high-throughput, suggesting that it should be possible to use data from one technique to validate the other. Previous studies have examined the level of agreement between DNA microarray data and RNA-seq data, among them [<xref rid="RSOS150402C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSOS150402C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Some of these studies indicate a strong correlation between the two techniques, while others demonstrate a substantial discordance, indicating that there are problems either in the techniques themselves or in the manner by which the datasets are compared. Since there is currently no consensus on the concordance between RNA-seq data and DNA microarray data, it is worthwhile to continue to investigate this issue.</p><p>While several previous studies have compared RNA-seq data to DNA microarray data [<xref rid="RSOS150402C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSOS150402C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], to our knowledge, only one (by Marioni <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="RSOS150402C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]) used quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) as an independent validation technique. Further, Marioni <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="RSOS150402C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] performed qRT-PCR on only a handful of genes. In this study, we compared transcript abundances in human foreskin fibroblasts that were in one of two states&#x02014;proliferating (&#x02018;PRO&#x02019;) or quiescent (&#x02018;QUI&#x02019;)&#x02014;using both DNA microarrays (two-channel OpArray microarrays with approx. 70&#x02009;bp probes) and RNA-seq (mRNA paired-end Illumina-based sequencing), and then used qRT-PCR to perform an independent measure of transcript abundance for 76 genes. The use of normal human fibroblasts provides a simple system of homogeneous cell populations to avoid &#x02018;noise&#x02019; that can mask transcript profiles in more complicated, less homogeneous systems, such as whole tissues. Specifically, we characterized the level of reproducibility of the RNA-seq data, the level of reproducibility of the microarray data, the correlations between the two techniques and the level of agreement of each technique with the qRT-PCR data. Measurements from different RNA-seq reactions applied to cells in the same state were highly consistent with one another, while the microarrays exhibited variable internal reproducibility. The concordance between the RNA-seq data and the individual microarrays was low, while a greater concordance was observed between the RNA-seq data and the geometric mean of the microarrays. The qRT-PCR data were more consistent with the RNA-seq data than with the microarray data. The findings from this study highlight the importance of validating any high-throughput technique to ensure confidence in the biological validity of the data.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><label>2.</label><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><label>2.1</label><title>Reproducibility of DNA microarray data</title><p>In order to determine the concordance between transcript abundances as measured by RNA-seq and by DNA microarrays, two RNA-seq reactions and four two-channel DNA microarray assays were performed. We first determined the level of internal reproducibility of the microarray data. Labelled cDNA libraries prepared from paired proliferative and quiescent cells were hybridized to each of four microarrays (OpArray, see Material and methods), with biological replicates used for each microarray. The four microarrays were labelled QP1, QP2, QP3 and QP4. &#x02018;Dye-swaps&#x02019; were performed for arrays QP2 and QP4 to ensure that there were no biases in the labelling protocol. Analysis of raw datasets was performed using the online microarray database software BioArray Software Environment (BASE) [<xref rid="RSOS150402C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], with which cross-channel correction and LOWESS normalization were performed.</p><p>Each microarray contained 35&#x02009;355 probes, each approximately 70&#x02009;bp in length. Correlations between probe intensity values (the intensity values for PRO in the first microarray versus the intensity values for PRO in the second microarray, and similarly for QUI) and fold change (FC) values (QUI/PRO) were determined for all <inline-formula><mml:math id="IM1"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac linethickness="0em"><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>6</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula> pairs of microarrays. Three measures of correlation were calculated: Pearson correlation, Pearson correlation between log-transformed values, and Spearman correlation. Correlations ranged from 0.78 to 0.94 for Pearson correlation, 0.78 to 0.94 for Pearson correlation between log-transformed values, and 0.77 to 0.94 for Spearman correlation (electronic supplementary material, table S1). Scatterplots for the comparisons between log-transformed intensity values are shown in the electronic supplementary material, figures S1&#x02013;S12.</p><p>Relative to the correlations between intensity values, the Pearson correlations between FC values were generally lower, ranging from &#x02212;0.01 to 0.71 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="RSOS150402TB1">table 1</xref>). This was expected given that the intensity values for PRO or QUI represent just a single random variable, whereas FC is a function of two random variables and thus should have greater variance. The Pearson correlations after log-transforming the FC values were highly variable, as were the Spearman correlations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="RSOS150402TB1">table 1</xref>). Both correlation measures were positive between microarrays QP1 and QP3 and between QP2 and QP4, but were negative between all other pairs of arrays. For example, a positive relationship was observed between microarrays QP2 and QP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS150402F1">figure 1</xref><italic>a</italic>), while microarrays QP1 and QP4 exhibited a negative relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS150402F1">figure 1</xref><italic>b</italic>). These negative correlations were unexpected; however, they might arise from the method used to label specific cDNA libraries. Each library was constructed to bind specific tags called dendrimers (see the Material and methods section for details) following hybridization of the cDNA to the arrays. Given the complex nature of dendrimer binding, it is possible that a number of spots on the arrays are giving values consistently with one dye regardless of the dye swaps for the samples and therefore disrupting the array correlations. For the majority of probes, there appeared to be little relationship between the log-transformed FC values between QP1 and QP4 (the &#x02018;cloud&#x02019; in the middle of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS150402F1">figure 1</xref><italic>b</italic>); however, probes with very high FC values in one microarray tended to have very low FC values in the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS150402F1">figure 1</xref><italic>b</italic>), resulting in a negative Pearson correlation. Scatterplots comparing FC values for the remaining pairs of microarrays are given (electronic supplementary material, figures S13&#x02013;S16).

Our analyses demonstrated that 751 genes (not probes) changed expression (428 increased and 323 decreased), and that these genes could be mapped to specific biological pathways, including cell cycle control and mitosis, as well as the complement and coagulation cascade. In this study, we re-analysed this RNA-seq data using several criteria to allow us to perform our comparisons with the microarray datasets.

Electronic supplementary material, figure S17, illustrates the graphical output of S<sc>eq</sc>M<sc>onk</sc> for three genes. The two proliferative RNA-seq replicates were labelled PRO1 and PRO2, while the two quiescent replicates were labelled QUI1 and QUI2.</p><p>The concordance between the RNA-seq replicates was determined both in terms of normalized read counts (i.e. the number of reads mapped to a given probe for PRO1 versus the number of reads mapped to the same probe for PRO2, and similarly for QUI) and in terms of FC values (i.e. QUI1/PRO1 versus QUI2/PRO2). A fixed value of 0.05 was added to the normalized read count for each probe to prevent division by zero when calculating FC values. While the Pearson correlations between read counts were fairly low (0.58 for PRO and 0.35 for QUI), the Pearson correlations between log-transformed read counts, as well as the Spearman correlations, were similar to or higher than those of the microarray data, ranging from 0.93 to 0.94 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="RSOS150402TB2">table 2</xref>). These correlations indicate that the relationships between the read counts deviated somewhat from linearity, but were close to monotonic. Scatterplots demonstrating the relationship between log-transformed values (electronic supplementary material, figures S18 and S19) confirmed this finding. Similar to the microarray data, where correlations between FC values were lower than between intensity values, the RNA-seq data exhibited lower correlations between FC values than between read counts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="RSOS150402TB2">table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS150402F2">figure 2</xref>).

Some RNA-seq probes were mapped to by more than one microarray probe; the total number of unique RNA-seq probes used was 22&#x02009;041 (14.8% of the total number of RNA-seq probes). Note that because the RNA-seq probes overlap in the genome, it is not the case that 85.2% of the RNA-seq data are being thrown away in the comparison to the microarray data; see the electronic supplementary material, Discussion, for more details.</p><p>To simplify the comparisons, the reads from the two PRO RNA-seq replicates were combined, as were the reads for the two QUI RNA-seq replicates. This was justified by the high reproducibility of the RNA-seq biological replicates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="RSOS150402TB2">table 2</xref>). These combined datasets were then compared to each individual microarray (i.e. the microarray data were not combined except as indicated below). Two types of comparisons were performed: first, normalized read counts from the RNA-seq data were compared to normalized intensity values from the microarrays; second, FC values from the RNA-seq data were compared to FC values from the microarrays. For the second comparison, correlations were also calculated between the RNA-seq FC values and the geometric mean of the four microarray FC values. The correlations between RNA-seq read counts and microarray intensity values for both PRO and QUI ranged from 0.18 to 0.22 for Pearson correlation, 0.32 to 0.41 for Pearson correlation between log-transformed values, and 0.29 to 0.40 for Spearman correlation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="RSOS150402TB3">table 3</xref>).

In response to this, we compared the microarray data to the RNA-seq data in two different ways: individually, as well as collectively. Comparing each microarray individually to the RNA-seq data has the advantage that the degree of concordance can be ascertained without inter-array variation being a contributing factor. By contrast, comparing the combined microarray data to the RNA-seq data has the advantage that it is more consistent with how experiments are typically done. More specifically, biological inferences are almost never drawn from the results of just a single microarray; it would be far more common to perform several replicates and then combine their results (e.g. by using the geometric mean of the FC values for a given probe). In this study, the correspondence of the FC values between RNA-seq and the individual microarrays was very low, ranging from 0.02 to 0.07 for the Pearson correlation, 0.17 to 0.23 for the Pearson correlation between log-transformed values, and 0.16 to 0.21 for the Spearman correlation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="RSOS150402TB3">table 3</xref> and electronic supplementary material, figures S28&#x02013;S31). Thus, none of the individual microarrays agreed with the RNA-seq data. When the data from the microarrays in this study were combined, the concordance between the RNA-seq data and the microarray data was much better than between the RNA-seq data and any of the individual microarrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS150402F3">figure 3</xref>). Specifically, the values of the three correlation measures were 0.42, 0.42 and 0.34, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="RSOS150402TB3">table 3</xref>). Thus, in practical terms, we would characterize the RNA-seq data and the microarray data as having a moderate degree of agreement. Since we observed negative correlations involving two of the arrays (&#x000a7;2.1), and although we were confident that our experimental procedure was performed correctly, we considered the possibility that an error occurred with the dye-swap. We therefore artificially swapped the dyes on these arrays and re-performed our analyses. In the results, the arrays were more in agreement with each other, although this generated more discordance between the array results and the RNA-seq results (data not shown), demonstrating that the negative correlations are not responsible for the disagreement between the two technologies.

Specifically, lists of the 10, 50, 100, 500 or 1000 probes with the highest FC values were determined for each microarray (and also the geometric mean of the four microarrays), as well as for the combined RNA-seq replicates. For each list size, the RNA-seq list was compared separately to the list for each microarray. Using the empirical statistical test described in Material and methods, a <italic>p</italic>-value was determined which indicates the likelihood that the level of overlap between a given pair of lists was greater than would be expected at random. For lists of size 10, there was no overlap between the RNA-seq data and microarrays QP1, QP3 and QP4, while there was one probe in common between the RNA-seq data and microarray QP2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="RSOS150402TB4">table 4</xref>). Two probes were in common between the mean microarray list and the RNA-seq list. For lists of size 100, 500 and 1000, all microarrays had more overlap with the RNA-seq data than would be expected at random. As with the correlations reported above, the degree of concordance was greater between the RNA-seq data and the geometric mean of the four microarrays than between the RNA-seq data and any of the individual microarrays (<xref ref-type="table" rid="RSOS150402TB4">table 4</xref>, last row). For instance, for lists of size 50, 12 probes were in common between the RNA-seq data and the combined microarray data, whereas for the same list size, the greatest number of probes in common between the RNA-seq data and one of the individual microarrays was 3. A list of the probes in common between the combined microarray data and the RNA-seq data for each list size is given in electronic supplementary material, table S2. In addition to probes having the greatest increase in transcript abundance in QUI relative to PRO, the same data were also determined for probes having the greatest decrease in transcript abundance (that is, the smallest FC values). The results for both analyses were very similar (electronic supplementary material, tables S3 and S4).

Of these, the numbers of corresponding RNA-seq probes that also had an FC value more than 5 were 31 (13.8%), 30 (3.8%), 26 (10.2%), 27 (2.8%) and 27 (54.0%), respectively. Thus, consistent with the results given above, the geometric mean of the four microarrays was far more concordant with the RNA-seq data than the individual microarrays.</p><p>The reason for the modest agreement between the RNA-seq data and the microarray data is unclear. Although all samples used in this study were biological replicates, the high internal reproducibility of both the microarray data and the RNA-seq data indicates that biological variability is an unlikely explanation. It is possible that the inability of DNA microarrays to distinguish between splice variants may play a role, as could the difficulty exhibited by DNA microarrays in detecting transcripts with low abundances. It is also possible that there are unforeseen biases that impact the results from RNA-seq.</p><p>The degree of concordance between DNA microarray data and RNA-seq data has been examined in several previous studies. For instance, Sultan <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="RSOS150402C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] examined differences in transcript abundance between two human cell lines (embryonic kidney cells and B cells) and observed a high correlation (0.88) between the log-transformed FC values derived from the two techniques. Similarly, Marioni <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="RSOS150402C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] compared transcript abundance profiles between human liver and kidney cells. The authors computed the correlation in two different ways: between the log-transformed normalized read counts from the RNA-seq data and the normalized intensity values from the microarray, and between the FC values (<italic>liver</italic>/<italic>kidney</italic>) from the RNA-seq data and the FC values from the microarray data. The correlations from both methods were similar, ranging from 0.67 to 0.75. In a review article, Wang <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="RSOS150402C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] compared data from a study that examined the yeast transcriptome using DNA microarrays [<xref rid="RSOS150402C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and a study that examined the yeast transcriptome using RNA-seq [<xref rid="RSOS150402C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The authors found that the correlation was very low (between 0.099 and 0.177) at low transcript abundances (according to RNA-seq), but higher (0.509) at moderate transcript abundances, perhaps reflecting the lower dynamic range of DNA microarrays. Fu <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="RSOS150402C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] used three different techniques to examine gene expression in human brain samples: DNA microarrays, RNA-seq and mass spectrometry. Depending on the samples used, the correlation between the RNA-seq data and the microarray data ranged from 0.51 to 0.67. Protein abundances, as quantitated using mass spectrometry, correlated with the abundances of the corresponding mRNAs more tightly for the RNA-seq data than for the microarray data. In yet another comparative study, the transcriptomes of male and female <italic>Drosophila pseudoobscura</italic> were characterized to identify genes whose transcription is sex biased [<xref rid="RSOS150402C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. High correlations were observed when directly comparing microarray intensity values with RNA-seq read counts, although lower correlations were reported when comparing FC values. A strong concordance between DNA microarray data and RNA-seq data was also observed in human T cells [<xref rid="RSOS150402C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and in a rat pain model [<xref rid="RSOS150402C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A summary of the correlations observed in this study and the studies described above is given in the electronic supplementary material, table S5. The studies described to date vary substantially in the strength of the reported correlations, demonstrating a lack of consistency when evaluating the extent to which the two techniques agree. Here, we report a degree of concordance between RNA-seq data and DNA microarray data that is consistent with, and at the lower end of, those reported thus far.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><label>2.4</label><title>Consistency between quantitative reverse-transcription PCR data and RNA-sequencing/microarray data</title><p>In order to provide measurements via an independent technique, qRT-PCR was used to measure transcript abundance for 76 genes. Each of these genes had a corresponding probe in both the microarray data and the RNA-seq data. Several genes were selected because they had FC values more than 5 in either the RNA-seq data only, the microarray data only, or both. Other genes were selected arbitrarily. Over all 76 genes, the RNA-seq data were more consistent with the qRT-PCR data than were the microarray data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="RSOS150402TB5">table 5</xref> and electronic supplementary material, figure S32), with correlations of 0.35, 0.56 and 0.56 (Pearson correlation, Pearson correlation of log-transformed values and Spearman correlation, respectively) for the RNA-seq data versus 0.25, 0.48 and 0.44 for the microarray data. The gulf between the RNA-seq data and the microarray data was greater for genes with more than fivefold differential expression according to qRT-PCR (<italic>n</italic>=35). In particular, there were 23 genes for which the log-transformed RNA-seq FC value was closer to the qRT-PCR FC value than was the mean of the log-transformed microarray FC values, versus 12 for the reverse (electronic supplementary material, table S6).

DNA microarrays are one of the most widely used high-throughput techniques, with around a million datasets deposited in online databases [<xref rid="RSOS150402C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS150402C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As sequencing costs continue to decrease, the rate by which RNA-seq data are generated will continue to climb, providing an extensive reservoir of information on transcript profiles from a variety of sources. Given that the two technologies are both used to measure transcript abundance, one would expect them to yield consistent results. However, previous studies that have compared RNA-seq data to DNA microarray data have reported widely varying degrees of concordance.</p><p>In this study, we measured transcript abundances in proliferative and quiescent fibroblasts using both DNA microarrays and RNA-seq. With some exceptions, replicates within the same technology were reproducible; however, the agreement between them was modest, although better agreement was observed for genes with large differences in transcript abundance between the proliferative and quiescent samples. Better agreement was also achieved when the RNA-seq data was compared against the geometric mean of the four microarrays rather than the individual microarrays. As an independent assessment, qRT-PCR was used to measure transcript abundance for several genes, and it was found that the qRT-PCR data were more consistent with the RNA-seq data than with the microarray data. As such, this study highlights the benefit of evaluating the reproducibility of transcript abundance measurements by using multiple independent techniques. More generally, for any type of biological measurement, this study indicates that the measurement should be made using more than one method when the opportunity exists to do so.</p><p>When considering the level of concordance between microarray- and RNA-seq-based transcriptome profiling, one must also consider the question to be addressed. For most biological studies, the question is probably aimed at identifying which genes have the most significant increase or decrease in expression/transcript abundance as a function of the experimental conditions. From this standpoint, our observations between RNA-seq and microarray demonstrated moderate concordance, with those genes identified to change expression in both datasets likely representations of true changes in gene expression. From an informatics perspective, the question may focus on the overall measurement across all genes, not just those that have changed significantly. Our data indicate that the low concordance across the entire dataset may require caution when interpreting data for informatics studies, but that a comparison of both data types will yield useful interpretations when identifying genes that have most significantly changed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><label>4.</label><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4a"><label>4.1</label><title>Cell growth</title><p>Normal human foreskin fibroblasts (2DD) [<xref rid="RSOS150402C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS150402C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium.
