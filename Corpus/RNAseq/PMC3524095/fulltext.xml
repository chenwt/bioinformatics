Fish reared at 21&#x02013;22&#x000b0;C (range) were fed a commercial diet at 3% body mass d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (non-satiation feeding, NSF) for 4 weeks, fasted for 4d (F) and then fed to satiation (SF) for 21d. 13 out of 34 genes investigated showed consistent patterns of regulation between nutritional states. Fasting was associated with a 20-fold increase in <italic>MAFbx</italic>, and a 5-fold increase in <italic>Six1</italic> and <italic>WASp</italic> expression, which returned to NSF levels within 16h of SF. Refeeding to satiation was associated with a rapid (&#x0003c;24 h) 12 to 17-fold increase in <italic>UNC45</italic>, <italic>Hsp70</italic> and <italic>Hsp90&#x003b1;</italic> transcripts coding for molecular chaperones associated with unfolded protein response pathways. The growth factors <italic>FGF6</italic> and <italic>IGF1</italic> increased 6.0 and 4.5-fold within 16 h and 24 h of refeeding respectively. The average growth in diameter of fast muscle fibres was checked with fasting and significant fibre hypertrophy was only observed after 13d and 21d SF. To investigate developmental plasticity in growth responses we used the same experimental protocol with fish reared at either 17.5&#x02013;18.5&#x000b0;C (range) (LT) or 21&#x02013;22&#x000b0;C (range) (HT) to metamorphosis and then transferred to 21&#x02013;22&#x000b0;C. There were persistent effects of development temperature on muscle growth patterns with 20% more fibres of lower average diameter in LT than HT group of similar body size. Altering the nutritional input to the muscle to stimulate growth revealed cryptic changes in the expression of <italic>UNC45</italic> and <italic>Hsp90&#x003b1;</italic> with higher transcript abundance in the LT than HT groups, whereas there were no differences in the expression of <italic>MAFbx</italic> and <italic>Six1</italic>. It was concluded that myogenesis and gene expression patterns during growth are not fixed, but can be modified by temperature during the early stages of the life cycle.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.

High rates of growth are a priority in intensive aquaculture systems. The main non-genetic factors influencing growth rate are body mass, diet composition, ration size, stocking density and other environmental factors such as temperature, water quality and oxygen availability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051884-Brett1">[2]</xref>. Juvenile gilthead sea bream (1&#x02013;10 g) can achieve growth rates of 5% d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at the optimal temperature of 21&#x02013;22&#x000b0;C doubling in body mass every 1&#x02013;2 weeks. The growth of fast skeletal muscle in juvenile fish involves the proliferation of a resident population of Pax7 expressing myogenic progenitor cells (MPCs) to produce myoblasts committed to terminal differentiation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051884-Rescan1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051884-Johnston1">[4]</xref>). The MyoD family of muscle transcription factors play a pivotal role in the commitment (MyoD, Myf5, MRF4) and differentiation (MRF4, Myogenin) of myoblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051884-Palmer1">[5]</xref>. Some MPCs fuse to form myotubes which initiate myofibrillargenesis and sarcomere assembly and mature into new muscle fibres (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051884-Rescan1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051884-Johnston1">[4]</xref>). Others are absorbed into existing muscle fibres to maintain the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio within certain limits as fibres increase in length and diameter with growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051884-Koumans1">[6]</xref>. Many transcription factors and signaling molecules regulating muscle growth have been described; however the detailed genetic and cellular mechanisms linking body mass, temperature and feeding intensity remain to be elucidated. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF1 and IGF2) signalling is involved in regulating many aspects of myogenesis including myoblast proliferation and the balance between protein synthesis and translation which determines hypertrophic growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051884-Johnston1">[4]</xref>. The liver is the main site for the production of circulating IGF1 under the influence of growth hormone produced by the hypophysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051884-Reinecke1">[7]</xref>. In addition, <italic>IGF1</italic> is expressed in most tissues including skeletal muscle indicating the presence of both paracrine and endocrine regulatory networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051884-Bower1">[8]</xref>. The IGF system comprises several membrane receptors, and six IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) which regulate the effective concentration of the hormone with some components existing as paralogues due to genome duplication in the teleost lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051884-Jailon1">[9]</xref>. Feeding promotes protein accretion through phosphorylation of key components of the IGF-signaling pathway including the target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Akt which activate translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051884-Bower1">[8]</xref>. Phosphorylation of Akt also inhibits the ubiquitin proteasome protein degradation pathway by phosphorylation of Forkhead box-O (FOXO) transcription factors causing them to become translocated out of the nucleus inhibiting the ubiquitin ligases Murf1 and MAFbx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051884-Cleveland1">[10]</xref>. Studies of fasting and refeeding have shown that the muscle transcriptome is also exquisitely sensitive to nutritional input, reflecting the anabolic or catabolic status of the fish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051884-Rescan2">[11]</xref>. Significant changes in transcript levels can occur very rapidly e.g. Atlantic salmon (<italic>Salmo salar</italic>) fed a single satiating meal after a period of fasting produced a peak in muscle <italic>IGFBP4</italic> expression within 1 h of feeding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051884-Valente1">[12]</xref>. This is particularly relevant during periods of compensatory growth, which are described as the exceptionally fast growth that occurs after a period of moderate or severe reduction in feeding. This phenomenon is normally associated with increased food ingestion rates and sometimes improved food conversion efficiency (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051884-Ali1">[13]</xref>).</p><p>Embryonic temperature change (ET) produces persistent changes in growth and muscle cellularity in teleosts grown at a common temperature from hatching <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051884-LpezAlbors1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051884-Johnston2">[15]</xref>. For example, in the zebrafish <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, the lifetime production of fast muscle fibres showed an optimum at 26&#x000b0;C ET and was 19% and 14% lower at 22&#x000b0;C ET and 31&#x000b0;C ET respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051884-Johnston3">[16]</xref>. Embryonic temperature was also shown to alter swimming performance with temperature acclimation in adult zebrafish, producing changes in muscle fibre composition and the expression of 61 out of 32,988 unique transcripts quantified by RNAseq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051884-Scott1">[17]</xref>.</p><p>The objective of the present study was to explore thermal imprinting of muscle growth in the gilthead sea bream. First we developed a compensatory growth model which explored the time course of responses to altered food intake. Early events investigated included phosphorylation of AKT, a key control protein in IGF-signaling, and the transcriptional regulation of genes associated with protein folding (<italic>Hsp90&#x003b1;, Hsp90&#x003b2;, Hsp30, Hsp70, UNC45, eIF2a</italic>), growth regulation (<italic>MAFbx</italic>, <italic>CathepsinD1, Calpain-3, IGF1, AKT2, IGFBP4, PCNA, Follistatin, FGF6, GHR1, Erk2, IGF2</italic>) or myogenesis (<italic>MyoD1, MyoD2, Myf5, MRF4, Myogenin, Caveolin-3, Six1, MEF2C, NAFTC2, m-cadherin, STAC3, Sox8, Pax7, WASp, CAMKII</italic>). Later events investigated included the abundance of myogenic progenitor cells and the production, and hypertrophy, of fast muscle fibres. We established that early temperature treatments altered muscle cellularity in juvenile fish reared at a common temperature. Using the fasting-feeding model we then tested the hypothesis that early temperature experience had persistent effects on gene expression patterns, providing a potential mechanism contributing to altered growth responses in the muscle.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Characterisation of Growth Responses to Altered Nutritional Input</title><p>The average growth rate with non-satiation feeding (NSF) was 2.52% body mass d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;60).

We tested the hypothesis that thermal imprinting of growth capacity altered transcriptional responses in our fasting-feeding model. Four out of the six genes studied had significantly different expression profiles, consistent with widespread and persistent effects of early temperature regime on gene expression. <italic>HSP90&#x003b1;</italic> and <italic>UNC45</italic> showed higher expression in all nutritional states, consistent with higher rates of protein synthesis and protein folding activity in the LT than HT treatments. Since the food content of the gut following satiation feeding was similar between temperature groups this suggests that higher heat shock protein expression in LT than HT fish was not due to greater food consumption or changes in amino acid absorption capacity at the level of the gastrointestinal system. <italic>IGF1</italic> transcript levels were higher following 3d SF in the LT than HT groups, but not at other nutritional states, consistent with a higher local production of <italic>IGF1</italic> contributing to the compensatory growth response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051884-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Differences in <italic>MyoD2</italic> expression between temperature groups were complex and less easy to interpret. Although only a small number of genes were studied this was sufficient to confirm our hypothesis of persistent effects of early temperature regime on juvenile gene expression. Similar results were recently obtained from a genome-wide survey of gene expression in zebrafish using RNAseq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051884-Scott1">[17]</xref>. In this study, embryonic temperatures (ET) at the limits for normal development were found to improve swimming performance following cold acclimation relative to fish raised at optimum ET, and this was associated with altered expression of more than 50 genes associated with energy metabolism. Thus in two unrelated species early thermal environment has been shown to have persistent effects on gene expression and physiological performance in adult fish. The mechanism(s) are unknown but could include epigenetic modification of chromatin e.g. by DNA methylation or selection through differential survivorship of offspring, particularly in gilthead sea bream which under captive rearing conditions can show 75&#x02013;85% larval mortality. From the perspective of aquaculture and conservation restocking programs these results clearly demonstrate that species-specific responses to environmental conditions in the hatchery have significant long-term consequences for the growth performance of adult stages.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Transcript levels of many growth-related genes in fast muscle, including <italic>MAFbx</italic>, <italic>Six1</italic>, <italic>MyoD2</italic>, heat shock protein genes and <italic>Calpain-3</italic> were strongly correlated with gut fullness, responding to altered nutritional input within 16 h.

All RNA samples had a 260/280 nm ratio higher than 1.9 and 260/230 ratio above 2.2. Genomic DNA was removed using genomic DNA wipe-out buffer included in the Quantitect reverse transcription kit (Qiagen). RNA (1 &#x000b5;g) was reverse transcribed into cDNA for 30 min at 42&#x000b0;C using a Quantitect reverse transcription kit following the manufacture&#x02019;s recommendations. To ensure that no genomic DNA was present in the samples a control without the reverse transcriptase enzyme was performed.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Quantitative Real-time PCR</title><p>The following procedures were compliant with the minimal information requirements for publication of quantitative PCR guidelines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051884-Bustin1">[35]</xref>.</p><p>Primers were designed using Net primer (Premier BioSoft) to have a TM of 60&#x000b0;C, and where possible to cross an exon-exon junction.
