Among the numerous factors known to affect chromatin compaction and dynamics are architectural chromatin-binding proteins such as the H1 linker histone variants (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), and all the members of the three high mobility group (HMG) protein families (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). H1s and HMGs are among the most abundant chromatin binding proteins; they are ubiquitously found in the nuclei of vertebrate cells, bind dynamically to chromatin without obvious specificity for the underlying DNA sequence and have been shown to affect chromatin compaction and genomic functions, including transcription (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Yet, despite numerous studies on these ubiquitous architectural proteins, their biological function and effects on gene expression are not fully understood. The HMG proteins consist of three families named HMGA, HMGB and HMGN, each characterized by a distinct structure and a unique chromatin-binding motif (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Here we focus on the role of the high mobility groups N (HMGN) protein family in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression during the activation of mouse B cells.</p><p>The HMGN protein family consists of five variants (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), all of which contain a conserved, positively charged region that facilitates their specific binding to the 147 base pair nucleosome core particle, the building block of the chromatin fiber (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). HMGN variants bind to chromatin dynamically with a short residence time (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), compete with each other for nucleosome binding sites, decrease the interaction of H1 variants with chromatin (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and reduce chromatin compaction (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Genomic profiling revealed that the binding sites of the major variants, HMGN1 and HMGN2, overlap with DNase I hypersensitive sites, the hallmark of regulatory sites in chromatin, such as gene promoters and enhancers (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Given the known effects of genome organization on gene expression, it could be expected that HMGNs affect the cellular transcriptome thereby impacting the cellular phenotype. Indeed, genetically altered <italic>Hmgn<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice show distinct phenotypes and transcriptional analyses of tissues taken from these mice revealed HMGN variant-specific effects on gene expression (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). A major unresolved question is whether HMGNs affect the ability of a cell to adequately respond to biological stimuli which involve rapid and major changes in chromatin organization and gene expression. Here we address this question in a biological relevant setting, by examining the role of HMGNs in the lipopolysaccharide and interleukin-4 (LPS + IL4) induced activation of na&#x000ef;ve splenic B cells.</p><p>Na&#x000ef;ve B cell lymphocytes reside in the mouse spleen in the quiescent G0 state, when transcription and protein synthesis are at basal levels (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Upon antigen stimulation, the resting lymphocytes drastically increase their transcriptional output and undergo additional changes that play a major role in the immune response (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Lymphocyte activation has been extensively studied <italic>ex vivo</italic> by stimulating quiescent CD43<sup>&#x02212;</sup> B cells isolated from spleen with LPS + IL4 (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). LPS + IL4 stimulation rapidly leads to major chromatin de-condensation, significant changes in epigenetic marks, promoter melting and RNA polymerase recruitment, resulting in more than 10-fold increase in RNA output (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Transcriptional responses have been detected as early as 30 min after activation; however it can last as long as 72 h for the full response to develop (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Given the biological significance of the immune response, it is important to understand the full spectrum of factors that affect the transcriptional response elicited during B cell activation.</p><p>Here we use lymphocytes prepared from the spleens of WT and <italic>Hmgn<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, to study the effects of HMGN on the organization of chromatin regulatory site and to examine the role of HMGN proteins in the transcriptional response during the course of activation of na&#x000ef;ve B cells. We found that stimulation of B cells leads to genome wide changes in the binding of HMGN to chromatin, that HMGN proteins co-localize with and maintain the intensity of DNase I hypersensitive sites genome wide in resting but not in activated B cells, and that loss of HMGNs dampens the magnitude of the transcriptional response and alters the pattern of gene expression during the course of B-cell activation. Our results provide new insights on the biological function of a ubiquitous family of nucleosome binding proteins and identify additional epigenetic factors that affect gene expression during B cell activation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Mouse strains</title><p><italic>Hmgn1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, in which the exons 2&#x02013;4 were deleted, <italic>Hmgn2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice which lack the entire <italic>Hmgn2</italic> gene, and <italic>Hmgn1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>n2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>, double knockout mice (DKO) generated by crossing <italic>Hmgn1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice and <italic>Hmgn2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice were previously described (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-2"><title>Preparation of resting and activated B cells</title><p>B lymphocytes were prepared as described (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).

In resting cells, the median intensity of HMGN1 and HMGN2 binding sites was 0.069 and 0.056 respectively, measured in reads per million (RPM) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">I</xref>).

We find that both HMGN1 and HMGN2 preferentially bind to CGI promoters, since over 90% of the promoters bound by either of these HMGN variants are classified as CGI promoters, in both resting and activated B cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). CGI promoters are often found in housekeeping gene and may affect transcription levels (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Therefore, we examined the relationship between CGI, HMGN occupancy and transcription levels in resting B cells, as determined by RNAseq of three biological replicates, which showed very low variability among the samples (Supplementary Figure S1). We identified the 25% most actively transcribed genes (high25) and the 25% least actively transcribed genes (low25) and examined the HMGN occupancies and the CGI content at the promoters of these genes. We find that the average occupancy of both HMGN1 and HMGN2 proteins at the high25 promoters containing CGI is 3-fold higher than at high25 promoters that do not contain CGI (compare black and blue lines in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). Furthermore, the occupancy of HMGNs at the low25 CGI promoters is higher than at the high25 promoters that do not contain CGI (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). Together, these results indicate that the major factor affecting HMGN binding to promoters is the presence of a CGI, rather than gene expression levels.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-2"><title>HMGN proteins modulate the landscape of DNase I hypersensitive sites in the chromatin of B cells</title><p>Enhancers and promoters are known to play a key role in gene expression; the location of these regulatory elements in chromatin can be identified and mapped by their hypersensitivity to digestion by DNase I (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).

Likewise, 39% of the DHSs that did, but only 6% that did not, overlap with HMGN1 localized to promoters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).

Similar results were noted with HMGN2 (Supplemental Figure S2). The strongest HMGN occupancies localized to the center of the DHSs, and the Pearson correlation coefficient between the DHSs signal intensity and HMGN occupancy was 0.97 for either HMGN1 or HMGN2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">I</xref>).

To examine whether HMGN variants affects the landscape of these regulatory sites we mapped the DHSs site in the chromatin of resting B cells obtained from wild-type (WT) or <italic>Hmgn1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>n2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> DKO B cells. We used DKO cells because HMGNs bind redundantly to chromatin (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and because we found that the chromatin binding of HMGN2 in B cells lacking HMGN1 was higher than in WT cells (Supplementary Figure S3).</p><p>We identified 34 192 DHSs in WT cells but only 23 736 DHS sites in DKO cells, a 30% loss of DHSs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Of the DHSs present in DKO cells, 22 538 overlapped with the DHSs seen in WT cells and 1198 sites were newly formed, i.e. not mapped in WT cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">F</xref>). Thus, the number of lost DHSs is approximately 10&#x000d7; larger than the number of gained DHSs sites, indicating that loss of HMGNs leads to a global reduction in DNase I hypersensitivity. Almost 95% of the DHSs observed in DKO cells were also detected in WT cells. The scatter plot of the DHSs at the CGI promoters shows a strong correlation between the intensities of the DHSs in WT and DKO cells, with a correlation coefficient of 0.97; however, the intensities of most DHSs, as measured by the reads per million (RPM) at any specific site in the DKO cells is reduced compared to the same sites in WT cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Likewise, although in both WT and DKO cells the DHSs seem to center at the TSS, the intensities of these sites in DKO is significantly reduced, showing only 50% of the intensities seen in WT cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). A similar level of reduction in DNase I hypersensitivity is observed at chromatin regions enriched in H3K4me1 and H3K27ac (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), histone modifications that mark enhancers (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). However, both the enrichment profiles and the heat maps indicate that the loss of DNase I hypersensitivity occurred not only at these specific marks but also in the regions flanking these marks (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">E</xref>).

The released nucleosomes are further digested and their DNA may not be included in the mononucleosomal fraction of an extensive digest. Therefore, we isolated and sequenced the nucleosomes obtained from both limited (0.05 U/ml) and extensive (2 U/ml) MNase digestion where respectively, either less than 5% or more than 90% of the chromatin was converted to mononucleosomes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Mapping of these nucleosomes with the TSS of the top 3000 expressed genes revealed differences between the nucleosomes isolated from limited and extensive digests. The nucleosome occupancy profile obtained from extensive digests show a nucleosome free region at the TSS, flanked by nucleosomes both down- and upstream. The nucleosome at position +1 is best positioned, as seen by the highest peak at that site (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">H</xref>). In contrast, the limited digests show the presence of a nucleosome positioned at the TSS, in the &#x02018;nucleosome free&#x02019; region seen in extensive digests (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">G</xref>). The nucleosome positions of WT and DKO cells are similar in both resting and activated cells; however, in the limited digests of both resting and activated cells, and to a lesser degree in the extensive digests of activated cells, the nucleosomes obtained from DKO cells have higher occupancy than those obtained from WT cells, as indicated by the height of the peaks surrounding the TSS.

In view of our finding that loss of HMGNs altered the landscape of chromatin regulatory sites, we tested whether loss of HMGN1 and HMGN2 affects the course of gene expression during the LPS + IL4 induced activation of primary B spleenocytes. To this end we used RNA-seq to analyze the transcriptome of WT and DKO B cells prior to, and at several time points after LPS + IL4 stimulation, using three3 biological replicates for each point. The scatter plots of the RNA-seq among the three biological replicates show high overlap with Pearson correlation coefficients of over 0.99 for all time points, in both WT and DKO (Supplemental Figure S4).</p><p>Principal component analysis of the transcriptomes at different activation time points shows distinct clustering in both WT and DKO cells, indicating significant changes in the transcription profile during the course of LPS + IL4 activation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>).

We selected the genes whose expression changed 2-fold or more between two consecutive time points in either WT or DKO cells and plotted these changes in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>, with black dots indicating WT and red dots indicating DKO cells. Sorting of the fold changes of all genes based on their values in WT cells, showed subtle but obvious differences between the two genotypes. The scatter of the red dots around the black line indicates that loss of HMGN1 and HMGN2 altered the magnitude of the transcriptional changes in most genes. Most noticeable differences are seen during the time course from 24 to 72 h after LPS + IL4 stimulation, where the overall magnitude of both upregulation and downregulation in gene expression was lower in DKO cells, since the great majority of the red dots cluster below the black lines in the upregulated genes, but above the black line in the downregulated genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref> lower right panel). A similar, but somewhat less pronounced trend is seen in the first hour after activation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>, upper left panel).

The largest number of significantly affected genes due to loss of HMGNs is seen in resting cells and during the last period of LPS + IL4 activation, with significantly more genes downregulated than upregulated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>). The differences between WT and DKO cells in the number of changed genes seen 1, 4 and 24 h after LPS + IL4 addition, i.e. during the course of activation, were significantly lower (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>). Conceivably, the significant effects of LPS + IL4 stimulation on chromatin structure and gene expression mask HMGN-dependent effects on transcription during the progression of activation to a larger degree than at the onset, or in the latest stages of activation, when the cells adjust to a new steady state of transcription. However globally, loss of HMGNs did not alter the ability of the splenic B cells to respond to LPS + IL4, since WT and DKO cells showed similar increases in cell size and in transcription, as measured by the amount of either total RNA, or mRNA produced 72 h after LPS + IL4 stimulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">F</xref>).</p><p>To identify possible biological pathways affected by the loss of HMGNs, we performed gene set enrichment analysis using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) which analyze transcriptome data by focusing on gene sets, rather than on individual genes and identifies statistically significant differences between gene sets of two biological states. The biological processes altered in DKO compared to WT cells at a high confidence level, at each of the time points tested, are listed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref> with blue indicating downregulated, and red indicating upregulated pathway. In resting cells (0 h) and at early activation time points, i.e. 1 and 4 h after LPS + IL4 stimulation, all the identified processes are downregulated in DKO cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). Several of the processes significantly altered, such as &#x02018;response to wounding&#x02019;, &#x02018;defense responses&#x02019;, &#x02018;inflammatory responses&#x02019;, &#x02018;regulation of lymphocyte activation&#x02019; and &#x02018;NF-KappaB&#x02019; cascades are related to immune functions. In addition pathways related to signal transduction such as &#x02018;response to biotic stimulus&#x02019;, &#x02018;cation transport&#x02019;, &#x02018;second messenger mediated signaling&#x02019;, &#x02018;ion transport&#x02019; and &#x02018;positive regulation of signal transduction&#x02019; are also down regulated. Indeed, examination of the proteins significantly downregulated at the first three time points (0, 1 and 4 h), indicated that the majority are located in the extracellular space, or are integral to the plasma membrane, or are components of typical signal transduction pathways, which is consistent with the identified biological processes affected (supplemental Table S1). The derived interaction maps generated with Cytoscape (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), in which the node size represents the relative gene set size and the line width represents similarity coefficient of the two connected nodes, visualizes the interconnection between the biological pathways affected by loss of HMGNs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). At the onset (0 h) and 4 h after LPS + IL4 stimulation, all the interconnected pathways are downregulated and with very few exemptions affect cellular responses related to immune or defense processes. However at the later stages of activation (72 h after stimulation), when the expression of over 200 genes were downregulated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>), no significantly under-represented biological pathways were identified in DKO cells; all the identified pathways were actually upregulated and related to &#x02018;RNA processing&#x02019; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). Thus, in resting cells and during initial stages of activation, the pathways most affected by loss of HMGNs are downregulated and related to immune system processes while in the terminal stages of activation the pathways affected by loss of HMGNs are upregulated and not related to obvious specific B cell functions.</p><fig id="F8" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Loss of HMGN1 and HMGN2 affects the expression of genes involved in immune response and signal transduction.

Nonetheless, the strong binding signals detected in the resting states and their close localization with DNase I hypersensitivity suggests that one of the potential major roles of HMGNs is to poise some of the genes for activation.</p><p>We find that the HMGN nucleosome binding proteins affect gene expression during the activation of B lymphocytes, a process that involves major changes in chromatin organization and plays a key role in immune responses. The genes most significantly affected during the early stages of activation are related to processes involved in immune response and signaling. The effects of HMGNs on gene expression correlate with their interaction with chromatin. In resting cells, loss of HMGNs affects significantly the expression of over 200 genes, with most of the genes being downregulated. The transcriptional changes affect pathways involved in cellular defense responses suggesting that, HMGNs modulates the innate, predetermined cellular transcription program, and are not regulating HMGN-specific cellular processes. Likely, HMGNs modulate the transcriptional profile of resting cells by interacting with, and modulating the intensity of chromatin regulatory site, as indicated by the genome wide co-localization of both HMGN1 and HMGN2 with DNase I hypersensitive sites, especially at promoters containing CpG islands, and at enhancer regions marked by H3K4me1 and H3K27ac. HMGNs may affect DNase I hypersensitivity by modulating the binding of linker histone H1 to chromatin (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), by interfering with the action of certain nucleosome remodeling complexes (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), by altering the levels of specific epigenetic marks in the tail of core histones (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), by changing the interaction of regulatory factors with chromatin (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), or by a combination of these effects.</p><p>We find that the DHSs at promoters are universally decreased across the whole genome and therefore we did not find a direct quantitative correlation between gene expression level changes and the DHSs changes. Nevertheless, the reduced DNase I hypersensitivity seen in resting DKO cells could still be the indirect underlying cause for the dampened transcriptional response seen one hour after activation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). Likely, in the initial stages of activation, the HMGN-induced changes in chromatin organization reduced the ability of transcriptional regulators to effectively alter the cellular transcription profile. However, during the progression of lymphocyte activation, the transcription profiles of WT and DKO cells are very similar with very few significant differences in gene expression, most likely because the LPS + IL4 activation leads to a major changes in the interaction of HMGN with chromatin. In addition, the induction of transcription regulators and the high levels of gene expression during the course of activation may mask the effects of HMGNs on chromatin structure and gene expression. Nevertheless, in fully activated cells, 72 h after LPS + IL4 addition, the gene expression profile of WT differs from that of DKO, with over 200 genes showing significant changes in gene expression levels. Interestingly, at this stage, when 10 times more RNA is produced compared with resting cells, the genes changed and the pathways affected are related to basic cellular functions such as &#x02018;RNA processing&#x02019; and &#x02018;ribosome assembly&#x02019; rather than to B-cell specific functions. Thus, although the interaction of HMGNs with chromatin is significantly decreased, their presence optimizes the expression of a subset of genes, some of which are involved in housekeeping functions, a possibility consistent with their high occupancy at promoters containing CpG islands.</p><p>In summary, our present studies indicate that HMGNs fine tune the fidelity of the cellular transcription profile during B cell activation. Likely, the impact of HMGN on transcription is not major because unlike most transcription factors, they bind to chromatin with low affinity and without specificity for DNA sequence and their chromatin interactions are affected by the presence of other chromatin-binding architectural proteins, including other HMG proteins and H1 variants (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Nevertheless, <italic>Hmgn<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice and cells do show phenotypes and gene expression changes especially when exposed to stress (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Thus, the changes in gene expression may be the underlying cause for the minor changes in the frequency of B cell subpopulation previously seen in a comprehensive phenotypic analysis of the DKO mice (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Moreover, changes in HMGN levels can lead to changes in B cell properties since the significant increased risk of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia seen in Down syndrome has been linked directly to overexpression of HMGN1 (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Thus, dysregulation of HMGNs levels may weaken the ability of B cells to cope with biological challenges.</p></sec><sec id="SEC5"><title>ACCESSION NUMBERS</title><p>The data from this study has been submitted to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/">http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/</ext-link>) under accession number SAMN04327545-SAMN04327548</p></sec>
