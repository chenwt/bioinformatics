This is particularly important because even at the recommend 30X coverage for reference methylomes, up to 50&#x00025; of high-resolution features such as differentially methylated positions (DMPs) cannot be called with current methods as determined by saturation analysis. To address this limitation, we have developed a tool that dynamically segments WGBS methylomes into blocks of comethylation (COMETs) from which lost information can be recovered in the form of differentially methylated COMETs (DMCs). Using this tool, we demonstrate recovery of &#x0223c;30&#x00025; of the lost DMP information content as DMCs even at very low (5X) coverage. This constitutes twice the amount that can be recovered using an existing method based on differentially methylated regions (DMRs). In addition, we explored the relationship between COMETs and haplotypes in lymphoblastoid cell lines of African and European origin. Using best fit analysis, we show COMETs to be correlated in a population-specific manner, suggesting that this type of dynamic segmentation may be useful for integrated (epi)genome-wide association studies in the future.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

To facilitate the complex analysis of such WGBS methylomes, a wide range of pipelines and algorithms has been developed with respect to cost, scale, resolution and biological questions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Informed decisions on resource allocation need to be made to tailor the data analysis to the experimental design while taking into account the advantages and disadvantages of single CpG resolution profiling with WGBS, where methylation estimates are derived from a cell population or a single cell assay. In a separate study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, we conducted an assessment of sequencing coverage required for quantitative detection of resolution-dependent methylome features such as differentially methylated positions (DMPs e.g., dynamic CpG sites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), differentially methylated regions (DMRs, e.g., tissue or disease specific DMRs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) and blocks of comethylation (COMETs), described here. As part of this study, we found that the majority of publicly available methylomes are single replicate, restricting the statistical analysis to e.g., Fisher's Exact test without the ability of taking biological variation into account. More recent tools for the analysis of differences at single CpG sites use counts of methylated and unmethylated reads at any given site. MethylKit<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, for example, uses the binomial distribution within a logistic regression framework, while several packages use beta-binomial assumptions for WGBS experiments including DSS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, MOABS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> and RADMeth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. BSmooth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> employs local-likelihood estimation for statistical smoothing in order to strengthen methylation inference at the regional (DMR) level&#x02014;a technique which works particularly well if methylation differences are large (e.g., in cancer) or where multiple replicates were chosen over deep sequencing of single replicates.</p><p>Another area of recent advancement includes analyses based on patterns of comethylation which were first observed over short (&#x0223c;1&#x02009;kb) distances by chromosome-wide profiling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> and subsequently confirmed by WGBS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. More recently, similar types of analyses have been developed for the identification of regulatory regions using <italic>methylSeekR</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, genetically controlled methylation clusters (GeMes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) and the visualisation of regional epigenome-wide association scan (EWAS) results<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Building on these advancements, we have developed COMETgazer, an algorithm for determining the stochastic oscillations of DNA methylation to dynamically segment entire methylomes into COMETs and COMETvintage to call DMCs. We then used these algorithms to assess their suitability to recover the &#x0223c;50&#x00025; loss of DMP information observed in our methylome saturation analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> and to determine the relationship between COMET and haplotype block seizes.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Oscillatory analysis for methylome segmentation</title><p>First, we assessed the performance of COMETgazer and COMETvintage on 13 WGBS methylomes which are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> and Methods. All WGBS methylomes were segmented into consecutive COMETs following defined patterns of oscillation in methylation values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). COMETs were calculated using varying oscillator of methylation grade (OMg) scores based on consecutive CpG methylation smoothed estimates. Analogous to the r<sup>2</sup> measure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> which is commonly used to define linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotypes, OMg scores are used here to dynamically define COMETs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> shows key features of COMET analysis. Oscillations in DNA methylation (OM) are defined as a continuous CpG density-independent K-period percentage difference series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>) based on the continuous smoothed methylation level estimate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). The quantile distribution of OM values is analysed independently for each chromosome (e.g., chromosome 1 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Most of the oscillations are around zero, and these define regions of co-methylation. Fragmentation in the methylome structure is defined as significant deviations in the quantile distribution used to call individual COMETs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). COMETgazer segments the entire methylome into consecutive COMETs based on DNA methylation oscillations, which define regions of transition at fine-grained level. Given the need to quantitatively define fragmentation for differential co-methylation analysis (e.g., DMC analysis), methylomes need to be analysed at the highest possible resolution. To illustrate this point, we compared COMET analysis with <italic>MethylSeekR</italic> which was developed to identify active regulatory regions by segmenting methylomes into umethylated regions (UMRs), low-methylated regions (LMRs) and partially methylated domains (PMDs). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>, for example, shows that PMDs have variable COMET content by fragmenting into multiple lowly (l) and medium (m) methylated COMETs and can even include highly (h) methylated ones. Together, the l- m- and hCOMETs are then used for sensitive identification of DMCs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref> summarizes the correlations between these features. PMDs have a correlation of 0.6 with hCOMETs but also include mCOMETs and lCOMETs. The latter have a relationship with UMRs and CGI (0.7 and 0.4 correlation, respectively). The segmentation obtained with COMETgazer is therefore substantially different to that from <italic>MethylSeekR</italic>. Compared to fixed regional thresholds used by <italic>MethylSeekR</italic>, COMETgazer uses dynamic segmentation parameters for CpG-wise processing of methylation values along chromosomes, allowing for higher resolution analysis of comethylation. Comparative analysis of M1, for example, reveals an average block size of &#x0223c;1,000&#x02009;bp for COMETgazer compared to &#x0223c;25,000&#x02009;bp for PMDs defined by <italic>MethylSeekR</italic> as regions of extended variable methylation, irrespective of methylation level. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref> show examples where PMDs span across CGIs and genes whereas the higher resolution COMETs may help to analyse the structure of these regions in more detail.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Information recovery of methylome features</title><p>Next, we compared COMET/DMC and DMR analyses to assess the possible recovery of DMP information lost in dependence of coverage after downsampling IHEC replicate methylomes M7&#x02013;10 against deep replicates M1&#x02013;2 as part of a separate saturation analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. For each methylome, the number of iCGs, DMPs, DMRs, COMETs and DMCs was determined. Two established algorithms (BSmooth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> and RADmeth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) were used for DMR and DMP calling respectively, while COMETvintage was used for DMC calling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>, Methods). COMETvintage uses the COMET distributions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>) as a count matrix with fixed windows applying a negative binomial model to obtain DMCs.</p><p>As our separate saturation analysis revealed that DMP calling at &#x0223c;30X coverage only captures &#x0223c;50&#x00025; of DMPs in a replicate analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, we assessed whether part of the lost information could be recovered through the analysis of higher complexity features such as DMRs and DMCs (semi-quantitative DMP content recovery). For this, we developed a suite of novel algorithms (COMETgazer and COMETvintage) which are freely available at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/rifathamoudi/COMETgazer">https://github.com/rifathamoudi/COMETgazer</ext-link>. Semi-quantitative DMP content recovery was measured by overlaps of significant features through smoothing as implemented in BSmooth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> for DMR analysis and measuring the breakage of COMETs by DMPs as implemented in COMETvintage for DMC analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>, Methods). The recovery using DMC analysis was on average 2.5-fold higher than for DMR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). DMC analysis recovered &#x0223c;35&#x00025; of the estimated RADmeth DMPs at maximum coverage, and &#x0223c;30&#x00025; at only 5X. In contrast, DMR analysis recovered only &#x0223c;20&#x00025; of the DMPs at maximum coverage and &#x0223c;10&#x00025; at 5X. The difference between DMR and DMC performance is most likely caused by individual DMPs disregarded by DMR callers but able to break COMETs and thus detected by COMETvintage. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3b</xref> shows an example of a DMC between M1&#x02013;2 and M7&#x02013;10 created by fragmentation of COMETs. For comparison, the underlying DMPs and DMRs are also shown at maximum and 30X coverage. Calling of DMRs and COMETs at different coverage is highly reproducible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Relationship between co-methylation and haplotypes</title><p>Finally, we explored the relationship between COMETs and haplotypes. As WGBS methylome data become available on a population-wide level, high complexity feature analysis such as COMETs may also offer a way to generate an epigenetic equivalent of the haplotype map (HapMap)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. To illustrate this potential, we generated a 37X methylome (M5) of an African (YRU) HapMap cell line (GM18507) with known linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure and compared the YRU-derived COMETs with the corresponding YRU haplotype blocks defined by LD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). A best fit analysis revealed high correlation (r=0.86, <italic>P</italic>-value=0.00112) for r<sup>2</sup>=0.9 and OMg=0.1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>) which decreased as expected by 0.4&#x00025; in significance when replacing YRU by a more distant and less fragmented European (CEU) haplotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest a possible functional relationship between genetic and epigenetic (DNA methylation) variants in line with recent observations using related analyses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>A recent saturation analysis of WGBS data revealed a major limitation for calling DMPs in methylomes generated at the recommended reference coverage of 30X (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Using a novel approach of segmenting WGBS methylomes into COMETs for subsequent calling of DMCs, we present a solution that is able to recover approximately 30&#x00025; of the lost DMP information content in the form of DMCs, doubling the recovery achievable to date by DMR analysis. However, our COMET/DMC analysis is not without limitation either. As for DMR analysis, DMP recovery by DMC analysis is not possible at single CpG level. For that, the corresponding DMRs and DMCs need to be subjected to additional targeted BS-seq for which a variety of methods are readily available<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. However, as biological processes predominantly involve multiple and frequently clustered changes in CpG methylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. DMR/DMC resolution will be adequate for many functional studies. An alternative solution would be to recover lost DMPs by imputation which proved highly successful for the recovery of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in low-coverage whole-genome sequencing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Towards this goal, a first method (ChromImpute) was recently developed and shown to be capable of imputing epigenomic maps with as little as 26&#x00025; of supporting experimental data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. While the imputed data were similar to the observed experimental data and even surpassed them in consistency, multiple complementary data were required to impute any particular mark, e.g., it is currently not possible to impute DMPs from WGBS data alone.</p><p>In addition to DMP recovery, we show COMET analysis to complement low-resolution functional methylome studies using PMD analysis. The COMETgazer algorithm provides a fine-grained segmentation of the methylome which breaks down variable regions (and detects regions of transitions) with an average block size of &#x0223c;1,000&#x02009;bp for COMETs compared to &#x0223c;25,000&#x02009;bp for PMDs, facilitating the identification of novel regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers within PMDs through differential comethylation using a negative binomial model. We propose that the oscillatory patterns of DNA methylation and the number of COMETs (the fragmentation) may be used as an additional metric to characterize epigenomes and are currently pursuing an integrative analysis with other epigenomic datasets including additional modalities (histone medications, RNAseq and HiSeq) from the International Human Epigenome Consortium (IHEC). A more speculative application of COMET analysis may be to harness it in the future for epigenome-wide association studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> and the generation of an epigenetic equivalent of the haplotype map<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Although only based on two cell lines from African and European descent, our finding that the relationship between COMETs and haplotypes appears to be population-specific is certainly interesting and warrants further investigation once WGBS data become available on a population level.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><p>The key metrics of the methylomes used here are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> and further details are described below.</p><sec disp-level="2"><title>Datasets</title><p>The M1 and M2 datasets have been deposited together into EGA under accession number EGAD00001001261.

Two reference sequences were prepared based on the hg19 human reference; reference_C2T had the C residues replaced by Ts, and reference_G2A had the Gs replaced by As. The sample preparation protocol followed ensures that reads from end 1 are from either of the original DNA strands, and are therefore generally C deficient (as unmethylated C residues are converted to T), and reads from end 2 are from the complement to the original strands and are therefore generally G deficient. The read data were fully converted prior to alignment, converting the remaining C's to T's in end 1, and converting G's to A's in end 2. The WGBS data was aligned using the GEM aligner (Kulis <italic>et al</italic>.)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> and (Marco-Sola <italic>et al</italic>.)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> allowing up to 4 mismatches from the reference. Uniquely mapping reads were selected where both read end1 mapped consistently, and no other consistent set of mappings for a read pair was found with the same number of mismatches. Duplicate read pairs were identified as read pairs mapping to the same position at both ends, and such pairs were merged to produce a consensus sequence for downstream analysis. Overlapping read pairs were handled by generating a single long read with the overlapping portion representing the consensus between the two ends. After read mapping, the reference sequence (C2T or G2A) that the read pair mapped to was recorded, and the original read data restored. Prior to further analysis, the 5 base pairs at the start of both read ends were trimmed since methylation estimation from these positions are unreliable due to the end repair procedure during sample preparation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Inference of genotype and methylation status</title><p>Genotype and methylation status were estimated simultaneously using software developed at the Centre Nacional d'An&#x000e0;lisi Gen&#x000f2;mica. A Bayesian model, taking into account the probability of under and over conversion and sequencing error, was used to estimate the joint posterior probability of genotype and methylation at each genomic site covered by at least 2 reads. The marginal posterior genotype probability was estimated by numerical integration of the joint posterior (using Gaussian quadrature). For sites where a single genotype presented &#x0003e;99&#x00025; of the posterior distribution, the maximum likelihood estimate of the methylation and the standard error of the estimate conditional the most probable genotype were calculated.

All methylomes were analysed on autosomes only. Features of increasing complexity were defined and computed for the subsequent saturation analysis as follows: Informative CpG sites (iCGs) were defined as canonical CpGs of at least 8X read coverage. Coverage was calculated on median counts across all iCGs and shown as iCG saturation curve. Counts were independently and randomly downsampled for every CpG. Differentially methylated positions (DMPs) in replicate analysis were defined as iCGs of genome-wide significance (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 after FDR adjustment), 10&#x00025; methylation difference and computed with RADmeth (Dolzhenko and Smith)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Single replicate DMPs were called with Fisher's Exact Test after Benjamini-Hochberg FDR adjustment (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) with minimum 10&#x00025; methylation difference and computed with custom software. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were defined as iCGs with 10&#x00025; minimum methylation difference and at least 3 DMPs per region and computed using BSmooth (Hansen <italic>et al</italic>.)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Blocks of comethylation (COMETs) were defined and computed using COMETgazer and differentially methylated COMETs (DMCs) were defined and computed using COMETvintage. The workflow for COMET analysis is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> and discussed in the section <italic>Workflow and feature definitions</italic>. Here we describe the definition of COMETs, and their relative count distributions as follows:</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Definition of blocks of co-methylation (COMETs): the COMETgazer algorithm</title><p>We define the stochastic <italic>oscillator</italic> of <italic>methylation</italic> (<bold>OM</bold>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>) as the one-series percentage change of CpG methylation (estimated on beta values, based on smoothed count data) in a single sample calculated as follows:</p><p><disp-formula id="eq1"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e625" xlink:href="ncomms11306-m1.jpg"/></disp-formula></p><p>where IndexCP defines current CpG beta value and IndexPP is previous (upstream) CpG beta value. The harmonics define the segmentation of the COMETs in a sequential manner across chromosomes treating the data as if it were a time series. This definition is inspired by Ulrich <italic>et al</italic>. (2013) (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) and Ryan <italic>et al</italic>. (2014) (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>), applications for calculating K series &#x00025; changes for stock variation in financial modelling. The relationship between methylation levels and delta OM values is shown for a representative region in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>.</p><p>COMETs are thus calculated using the following COMETgazer algorithm:

Haplotype blocks for the sample Coriell NA18507 (HapMap GM18507) representing an African (YRU) haplotype and HapMap data for an European haplotype (CEU) were defined using a r<sup>2</sup> threshold of 0.9 and calculated by binning the data into 100&#x02009;bp windows and estimating the coverage counts of these over 100,000&#x02009;bp windows for three distributions (depending on size) using two quantile thresholds (33&#x00025;, 66&#x00025;). In this manner, we obtained values for large (laHAB), medium (meHAB) and small haplotype blocks (smHAB) for each of the windows. The same procedure was applied to COMETs, obtaining counts for large (laCOMET), medium (meCOMET) and small (smCOMET) COMET by size. For each window, the normalized COMET score (NC) and normalized haplotype block score (NH) was obtained as follows:</p><p><disp-formula id="eq2"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e802" xlink:href="ncomms11306-m2.jpg"/></disp-formula></p><p>The scores for haplotype blocks and COMETs obtained were rescaled to a 0&#x02013;1 distribution for a direct comparison.
