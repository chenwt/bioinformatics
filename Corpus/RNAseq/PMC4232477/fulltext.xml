During Zn limitation, <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> hyperaccumulated Cu, dependent on the nutritional Cu sensor CRR1, but was functionally Cu-deficient. Visualization of intracellular Cu revealed major Cu accumulation sites coincident with electron-dense structures that stained positive for low pH and polyphosphate, suggesting that they are lysosome-related organelles. NanoSIMS showed colocalization of Ca and Cu, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was consistent with Cu<sup>+</sup> accumulation in an ordered structure. Zn resupply restored Cu homeostasis concomitant with reduced abundance of these structures. Cu isotope labeling demonstrated that sequestered Cu<sup>+</sup> became bio-available for the synthesis of plastocyanin, and transcriptome profiling indicated that mobilized Cu became visible to CRR1. Cu trafficking to intracellular accumulation sites may be a strategy for preventing protein mis-metallation during Zn deficiency and enabling efficient cuproprotein (re)-metallation upon Zn resupply.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Many proteins in cells are associated with metal ions, which provide structural stability and catalytic functionalities like electrophiles, reductants and oxidants that are not readily provided by functional groups of amino acids<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Nature has used the unique chemical properties of each metal ion -- such as ligand preferences, coordination geometries and redox potential -- to generate an amazing repertoire of catalytic abilities, such as the reduction of dinitrogen to ammonium and the oxidation of water, under gentle biological conditions. These catalytic activities are dependent on specific metal cofactors in unique active sites, and life is therefore dependent on the bioavailability of a combination of metal ions. It is critical that the right metal cofactor occupies specifically its dedicated active site. The divalent metal ions of Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn bind to functional groups in proteins according to thermodynamic preferences described by the Irving-Williams series<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, which means that without a mechanism for selectivity <italic>in vivo</italic>, metal binding would be driven by the concentration of the metal ion and these preferences toward the available binding sites<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The best understood mechanisms for ensuring selectivity of metal-protein association include the metallochaperones (prototyped by the Cu chaperones Atx1 and Ccs<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>), which effect transfer of the metal to its final target site via specific protein-protein interactions and ligand exchange, and compartmentalized assembly (prototyped by MncA)<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, in which holoprotein formation is restricted to a compartment with the appropriate high concentration of the desired metal ion and low concentration of an undesired but thermodynamically preferred metal ion<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Kinetic barriers generally preclude metal exchange or dissociation once the metalloprotein is in its final sub-cellular location.</p><p id="P3">Since Cu<sup>2+</sup> is at the top of the Irving-Williams series and Cu<sup>+</sup> also has strong preferences for soft ligands like thiolates, most intracellular compartments maintain very low concentrations of &#x0201c;free&#x0201d; Cu ions<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. For instance, <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> (<italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>), a eukaryotic reference organism for studying metal homeostasis in the context of chloroplast biology, maintains a Cu quota that is determined strictly by the abundance of various cuproproteins required for its metabolism, especially plastocyanin for photosynthesis, cytochrome (Cyt) oxidase for respiration and a ferroxidase for iron assimilation, even when presented with 100-fold excess Cu in the growth milieu<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. This is achieved by restricted Cu uptake. In Cu-deficient conditions, <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, like other algae and many cyanobacteria, can reduce the Cu quota substantially by substituting a heme protein, Cyt <italic>c</italic><sub>6</sub>, for plastocyanin<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. The reciprocal accumulation of Cyt <italic>c</italic><sub>6</sub> vs. plastocyanin as a function of medium Cu content serves as a readout of the Cu nutritional state, and is effected by a transcriptional program dependent on a Cu-sensing SBP-domain transcription factor called CRR1<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Cu homeostasis in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> is disrupted by nutritional Zn deficiency, which results in unprecedented Cu accumulation, up to 20 times the typical quota<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. In this work, we used high resolution secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) with a NanoSIMS 50 to localize Cu in intracellular compartments<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, reminiscent of the acidocalcisome and the previously-described zincosomes<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. The accumulated Cu<sup>+</sup> was in a reproducibly organized chemical environment consisting of N, S and O ligands, but it became bio-available with priority over extracellular Cu for de-activating CRR1 and metalating apoplastocyanin. We hypothesize that compartmentalization would prevent mis-metallation of Zn enzymes but this would result in intracellular Cu deficiency, which would activate CRR1, resulting in feed-forward over-accumulation.

Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) of these cells showed dramatic accumulation of Cu, up to ~ 30&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup> atoms per cell in standard growth medium containing 2 &#x003bc;M Cu<sup>2+</sup>-EDTA (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>).

On the other hand, the abundance of plastocyanin was dramatically reduced in Zn-limited cells just as it was in Cu-deficient ones (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>), indicative of functional Cu-deficiency. This situation would activate the expression of the assimilatory CTR-family Cu<sup>+</sup> transporters via CRR1 and in so doing would account for the concentration-dependent hyper-accumulation of Cu.

CS3 did not respond to pH alone and retained the ability to respond to Cu in the pH range of 4 to 7.5 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>), which makes it suitable for staining intracellular compartments. Ctrl-CS3 (<bold>1</bold>) employed an identical BODIPY fluorophore and has the exact same number of receptor atoms (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>), except that the four sulfur atoms that are essential for metal interaction in CS3 are replaced by isosteric carbons that lack affinity for Cu binding (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Indeed, Ctrl-CS3 did not respond to Cu or pH changes as demonstrated by Cu and pH titration assays (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>) and thus could be used in conjunction with CS3 to distinguish between Cu- vs. any potential dye-backbone-dependent responses.</p><p id="P9">Confocal fluorescence microscopy with CS3, but not its Ctrl-CS3 counterpart that does not respond to Cu, showed the presence of fluorescent foci that correlated with the Zn-deficiency status of the cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>); the foci were not as frequently observed in Zn-replete cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>). More importantly, fluorescent foci were seen only in situations where ICP-MS methods indicated high intracellular Cu content. Specifically, the fluorescent foci were not observed in cells of the <italic>crr1</italic> mutant, which cannot hyperaccumulate Cu, but were readily visualized in Zn-limited cells of the complemented strain (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). The CS3 signal was significantly reduced when cells were treated with a cell permeant Cu chelator, glutathione mono ethyl ester prior to staining with CS3 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). Multiple control experiments were performed to ensure the specificity of CS3 for Cu<sup>+</sup> in this model system (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 20</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Because CS3 is based on a lipophilic BODIPY-platform<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, there is concern that the probe might be staining lipid bodies, which do accumulate in Zn-deficient cells<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>, and we performed multiple lines of control experiments to address this potential issue. First, the Ctrl-CS3 dye, which lacks the Cu binding atoms but retains the same lipophilic dye platform, did not stain the putative Cu puncta or any other body in Zn-deficient cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>). We also tested whether CS3 would visualize lipid bodies in N-deficient Chlamydomonas cells, which hyper-accumulate lipids but do not hyper-accumulate Cu. We found that lipid bodies in N-deficient cells, which do stain well with Nile Red, did not stain with CS3 in parallel experiments with the same settings (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p id="P11">With these pilot data suggesting further investigation, we sought to use an unequivocal physical technique to identify the intracellular Cu foci. Direct metal detection techniques such as X-ray fluorescence microscopy have been valuable to support indirect metal imaging obtained using synthetic fluorophores<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. In the present study, electron-dense structures were revealed in microtomed thin-sections of fixed cells by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and these were candidate sites for Cu accumulation. Indeed, the abundance and size of the electron dense structures correlated with Zn nutrition (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). Kruskal-Wallis One Way Analysis of Variance on ranks of the electron-dense areas in the electron micrographs in relation to total cell areas found a significant difference between the Zn-limited and Zn-replete sections (p-value P= &#x0003c;0.001) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>, right panel). NanoSIMS imaging, which allows simultaneous spatial detection of elements based on their mass, indicated that regions containing calcium (Ca) and Cu correlated with electron-dense structures at the periphery of the cells visible in TEM images of the same sections (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). Co-localization of Ca and Cu in Zn-limited cells was confirmed independently by confocal microscopy and dual staining of cells with CS3 and Fluo-4-AM, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-specific fluorescent dye (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To test the relationship between sites of Cu concentration and Zn-deficiency, we re-supplied Zn<sup>2+</sup> to cultures of Zn-limited cells, and sampled over a 24 h time course for NanoSIMS analysis of thin sections. We noted a decrease in Cu abundance over time at the foci of Cu concentration as well as over the total cell area (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c, d, e</xref>), which coincided with the ICP-MS measurements showing Cu accumulation only under strict Zn limitation. This observation suggests further that Cu can be mobilized from the sites of concentration (see below).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Compartmentalized Cu<sup>+</sup> is stabilized by O/N and S ligands</title><p id="P13">We recorded Cu K-edge XANES spectra, which provide information about the average electronic state and ligand symmetry of the metal, on Zn-limited <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4f</xref>). The spectra showed a highly reproducible pre-edge feature centered at 8984 eV, which is typically attributed to 1s-4p electronic transitions in centrosymmetric Cu<sup>+</sup> environments: the intensity of this feature also provides insight into the cuprous coordination geometry, which was indicative of 2 to 3 coordinate Cu<sup>+</sup>. The absence of any appreciable feature at 8980 eV in the Cu pre-edge XANES, a feature attributed to 1s-3d transition in Cu<sup>2+</sup>, suggests Cu<sup>2+</sup> in these samples was limited (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4g</xref>). Based on model pre-edge XANES analysis, our expectation is that Cu<sup>2+</sup> contamination in the samples would be noticeable, had it been present at 15% or greater proportion.

Without detergent, the bodies, which were much more abundant in extracts of Zn-limited cells, had a tendency to form large aggregates, even upon vigorous vortexing.

The peak of eluted plastocyanin with a retention time of 16.6 min (17 min fraction) compared to the plastocyanin associated peak with a retention time of 18.2 min was due to the time lag between protein detection by the LC multiwavelength detector and Cu detection by the ICP-MS mass analyzer (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>).

Here, we took advantage of Cu mis-regulation in Zn-limited cells to analyze sites of Cu sequestration in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>. Pilot survey experiments with a pair of matched fluorescent dyes that can (CS3) or cannot (Ctrl-CS3) respond to Cu<sup>+</sup> in live-cell imaging experiments led to direct detection of sites of Cu accumulation by imaging mass spectrometry of fixed, sectioned cells, which localized bound Cu only<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. In this context, we note that fluorescent probes are a developing technology that should be employed with caution and appropriate controls, both genetic and chemical. These reagents are designed and physically characterized by chemists in tightly controlled in vitro environments but biologists may use them in vastly divergent cells and organisms where solubility, intracellular distribution and reactivities can vary.</p><p id="P24">To help address some of these potential issues, we designed an iso-structural control compound that can be employed to distinguish between dye-dependent and receptor- dependent fluorescence responses in an intracellular environment. Replacement of metal- interacting sulfurs in CS3 with isosteric carbons yields a matched Ctrl-CS3 dye that lacks responsiveness to Cu and pH and represents a new chemical approach for the use of small molecule sensors in vivo. Yet, the presence of more reactive functionalities in CS3 vs. Ctrl-CS3 may create unanticipated chemical reactions in vivo. The use of appropriate controls cannot be over-emphasized. For instance, while CS3 does not by itself stain lipid bodies in Chlamydomonas, CS3 (but not Ctrl-CS3) will fluoresce in co-staining experiments with some dyes (e.g. DPH), possibly because of an interaction between the two dyes dependent on the 4 S atoms. The precise mechanism by which CS3 responds in Chlamydomonas compartments is insufficiently understood, whether by direct binding or by an unknown Cu<sup>+</sup>-mediated process, and the fluorescence output is not quantitative. Nevertheless, the dependence of the signal on intracellular Cu content, as directly measured by ICP-MS and Nano-SIMS, and a functional <italic>CRR1</italic> locus, along with the fact that the isosteric Ctrl-CS3 does not respond to changes in intracellular Cu in these same strains, strengthens the interpretation of the CS3 signal in the models used in this study (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>). The use of fluorescent probes as a tool for pilot screening in live samples is potentially useful in downstream high throughput genetic screens now that their validity has been established in this organism with more resource&#x02013;intensive physical techniques. We note that in vitro experiments with small molecule sensors (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note</xref>) clearly do not faithfully mimic all aspects of their chemistry in a biological setting. Therefore, each probe must be tested in each experimental model accompanied by other chemical and/or genetic controls in that model.</p><p id="P25">Imaging mass spectrometry has the caveat that it requires chemical fixation and sectioning of cells and is therefore restricted to analysis of bound elements in that section. We cannot rule out the possibility that there is another pool of Cu<sup>+</sup> that neither technique reached. Taken together, both methods support the conclusion that <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> sequestered Cu under Zn limitation, causing Cu to be unavailable for cuproprotein biosynthesis and hence <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> plastocyanin levels (a biomarker for intracellular Cu) were low (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>).

The acidocalcisome is a low pH, lysosome-related organelle that contains polyphosphate and metal ions, especially Ca and Fe<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>.

By analogy to zincosomes described in worms and animal cells and Zn-accumulating lysosome-related organelles, it may be useful to refer to the Cu<sup>+</sup> containing compartments as cuprosomes<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P27">Researchers have previously found foci of Cu accumulation, including in cells of Wilson Disease patients, in the Ctr<italic><sup>int/int</sup></italic> mouse where intestinal epithelial cells contain sites of Cu concentration and in mouse fibroblasts lacking metallothionein and Atox1<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>.

The recapitulation of this phenotype in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> provided an excellent opportunity to use a genetic approach to dissect the mechanism of formation of the Cu-loaded compartment and the pathways of Cu mobilization from these compartments. At present, the identities of the transporters that load and unload Cu<sup>+</sup> into and from this lysosome-related organelle are unknown.

The microbial experimental system used in this work allowed the generation of a homogenous population of cells with very high Cu content, suitable for application of X-ray spectroscopic approaches. Independent samples generated months apart yielded superimposable XANES spectra, indicating that sequestered Cu was reproducibly organized. The EXAFS analysis suggests mononuclear Cu associated with organic ligands (O/N and S) rather than with polynuclear Cu species. We compared the spectra to those of known compounds (including glutathione, polyphosphate, phytochelatins) but the Cu species in this work was distinct from previously characterized species. While transcriptome profiling indicated up-regulation of a phytochelatin synthase, this may be a pre-emptive mechanism against Zn shock<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> rather than a means for chelating the sequestered Cu<sup>+</sup>.</p><p id="P29">Aside from the known function of acidocalcisomes to house elements, such as Ca, P, Fe, and Zn, we showed here that this compartment can also house Cu<sup>+</sup>. More importantly, the compartment served as a reservoir of Cu<sup>+</sup> that could become bio-available when the cell required Cu<sup>+</sup>. The vacuole in yeast is perhaps the most analogous compartment: it stores Zn<sup>2+</sup> in a situation of excess but in deficiency it can mobilize the Zn<sup>2+</sup> and support several rounds of replication in the absence of external Zn<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. We showed that the same is true for sequestered Cu<sup>+</sup>. Indeed, even in the presence of extracellular Cu, compartmentalized Cu<sup>+</sup> was used with priority over assimilated Cu<sup>+</sup> for the biosynthesis of holoplastocyanin. Furthermore, accumulated Cu<sup>+</sup> offered a selective advantage to cells when they were faced with nutritional deficiency, consistent with bio-availability of compartmentalized Cu<sup>+</sup>. We conclude that the metal content of the Cu accumulating compartment is dynamic and can be used for productive metallation of apoproteins.</p><p id="P30">Sequestered Cu<sup>+</sup> was released when we removed the condition prompting sequestration, namely Zn<sup>2+</sup> limitation (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>). The released Cu<sup>+</sup> was not only available for holoplastocyanin formation (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref>) but it also became visible to CRR1. Transcriptome analysis indicated rapid de-activation of the Cu regulon coincident with accumulation of holoplastocyanin (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). This accounted for decreased Cu<sup>+</sup> uptake capacity as a function of time after Zn addition (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref>). On the other hand, Cu<sup>+</sup> handling components (PCC1, ATX1 for delivery of the metal to the chloroplast or secretory pathway) were instead up-regulated, consistent with redistribution of intracellular Cu<sup>+</sup>.</p><p id="P31">Why was Cu<sup>+</sup> sequestered in Zn-limited cells? One possibility is that this occured to prevent mis-metallation of Zn<sup>2+</sup> sites in enzymes. In the absence of a specific mechanism for Zn<sup>2+</sup> delivery to these enzymes, low intracellular concentrations of Zn<sup>2+</sup> might allow binding of Cu<sup>+</sup>, which would be more competitive for binding to these sites. This is true for the SBP domain of CRR1, which binds Cu<sup>+</sup> with 10<sup>5</sup> higher affinity relative to Zn<sup>2+16</sup>. Indeed, in <italic>Euglena gracilis</italic>, Zn-deficiency results in mis-incorporation of Cu instead of Zn into an endonuclease, rendering it inactive<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. Sequestration of Cu<sup>+</sup> would remove the more competitive metal species and allow trace levels of Zn<sup>2+</sup> to metalate critical proteins, such as those involved in nucleic acid transactions. Another possibility is that Cu is transiently delivered to this compartment en route to its final destination, but in Zn-deficiency egress is blocked or inhibited. This may occur if the transport from the compartment requires Zn<sup>2+</sup> or if the cytoplasmic Zn/Cu ratio regulates efflux.

To remove insoluble membrane fractions remaining in the supernatant, ultracentrifugation (250,000 x<italic>g</italic> at 4&#x000b0;C for 1 h) was done in tubes closed by heat-melting. The clear supernatant (with a total protein content of ~1 mg/mL) was then subjected to subsequent protein fractionation and metal content analysis by HPLC-ICP-MS (see below).</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Metalloprotein analysis by HPLC-ICP-MS</title><p id="P43">Isotope-specific metalloprotein analysis was performed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) linked with inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Aliquots of total soluble protein (~0.5 mg) prepared from different cell samples were injected manually into a bioinert Agilent 1260 HPLC system (Agilent Technologies) that was equilibrated inside an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratories). The protein crude extracts were separated anaerobically in 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 20 mM KCl at 25 &#x000b0;C and at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min <italic>via</italic> size exclusion chromatography on a 7.5 mm&#x000d7;30 cm TSKgel G3000SW column (Tosoh). The eluent stream was subjected to a split flow directing it to the source of the ICP-MS for online metal analysis using the high matrix interface as well as to the HPLC fraction collector for subsequent protein species analysis by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry. ICP-MS analysis was run in the helium gas mode with time-resolved analysis to minimize signal suppression in presence of higher salt contents. Isotope-specific ion chromatograms were obtained for <sup>65</sup>Cu and <sup>63</sup>Cu upon extraction from the total ion signals. The protein elution profiles were recorded by a multi wavelength detector at 280 nm using a 500 nm reference signal. The delay time between UV/vis detection of the protein species and the detection of associated metal cofactor(s) by ICP-MS was ~1.6 min, which was also confirmed by using Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Sigma Aldrich) as well as purified <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> plastocyanin as metalloprotein standards (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 13</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Electron microscopy</title><p id="P44">Cells and Cu accumulating compartments were prepared for electron microscopy as described for NanoSIMS analysis above. Sections of 60 nm thickness (gray interference color) were cut on an ultramicrotome (RMC MTX) using a diamond knife. The sections were deposited on single-hole grids coated with Formvar and carbon and double-stained in aqueous solutions of 8% uranyl acetate for 25 min at 60&#x000b0;C and lead citrate for 3 min at room temperature. Thin sections were examined with a 100CX JEOL (80 kV) electron microscope. For NanoSIMS studies, samples were prepared without uranyl acetate and lead citrate stainings, and 200 nm sections were cut and deposited on molybdenum grids, which were carbon-coated prior to analysis. Image J software was used to manually define and measure whole cell areas and electron dense structures. The ratios of electron dense structure to whole cell area are given in percentage. Cells from three independent Zn-replete or&#x02013;limited cultures were analyzed. 55 Zn-limited cells and 79 Zn-replete cells were analyzed. Kruskal-Wallis One Way Analysis of Variance on ranks was used to determine the statistical significance of the data (P = &#x0003c;0.001). For TEM analysis of Zn resupply time course, we analyzed 45 cells at t = 0 h, 32 cells at t = 10 h, 40 cells at t = 24 h, 42 cells at t = 60 h, 35 cells from the Zn-replete culture (early), and 28 cells from the Zn-replete culture (late).</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>RNA-Seq</title><p id="P45">RNA was extracted from Zn-limited cells and at 1.5, 3, 4.5, 12, and 24 h after Zn resupply as described above.
