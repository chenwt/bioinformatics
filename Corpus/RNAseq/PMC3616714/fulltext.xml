Following mutational analysis, we concluded that <italic>ssbA</italic> is essential, whereas <italic>ssbB</italic> plays a key role in chromosome segregation during sporulation. In the <italic>ssbB</italic> mutant, &#x0223c;30% of spores lacked DNA. The two <italic>ssb</italic> genes were expressed differently; in minimal medium, gene expression was prolonged for both genes and significantly upregulated for <italic>ssbB</italic>. The <italic>ssbA</italic> gene is transcribed as part of a polycistronic mRNA from two initiation sites, 163 bp and 75 bp upstream of the <italic>rpsF</italic> translational start codon. The <italic>ssbB</italic> gene is transcribed as a monocistronic mRNA, from an unusual promoter region, 73 bp upstream of the AUG codon. Distinctive DNA-binding affinities of single-stranded DNA-binding proteins monitored by tryptophan fluorescent quenching and electrophoretic mobility shift were observed. The crystal structure of SsbB at 1.7 &#x000c5; resolution revealed a common OB-fold, lack of the clamp-like structure conserved in SsbA and previously unpublished S-S bridges between the A/B and C/D subunits. This is the first report of the determination of paralogous single-stranded DNA-binding protein structures from the same organism. Phylogenetic analysis revealed frequent duplication of <italic>ssb</italic> genes in Actinobacteria, whereas their strong retention suggests that they are involved in important cellular functions.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p><italic>Streptomyces</italic> species are multicellular bacteria that exhibit a complex developmental programme and undergo morphological differentiation. Development of streptomycetes is initiated by spore germination, hyphal growth and branching that leads to the formation of vegetative mycelium. From this mycelium, new branches grow into the air forming a lawn of aerial hyphae, which eventually generate long chains of unigenomic spores. Much current knowledge of streptomycetes is based on genetic and genomic studies of <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> M145 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B1">1</xref>). The large, linear chromosome of this bacterium encodes 7825 ORFs with a large number of genes (12.3%) predicted to encode a regulatory proteins. In addition, genome analysis has revealed the distribution of different types of genes. Nearly all genes expected to be essential, such as those for cell division, replication, transcription, translation and the biosynthesis of important primary metabolites, are located in the core region. Exceptions to this rule are often duplicated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B2">2</xref>). Amongst the latter group are two paralogous genes encoding single-stranded DNA-binding (SSBs) proteins.</p><p>SSB proteins, essential for cell survival, are found in all domains of life and in viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B3">3</xref>). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> SSB has been used extensively for several decades for studying protein structure&#x02013;function relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B4">4</xref>). SSB binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with high affinity in a sequence-independent manner, thus protecting ssDNA intermediates and disrupting unproductive secondary structures. During DNA replication, recombination and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B5">5</xref>), SSBs interact with an array of chromosome maintenance proteins, mobilize them to the site of activity and often stimulate their activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B7">7</xref>).</p><p>The primary structures of SSB proteins display two distinct domains: an N-terminal domain containing a conserved oligonucleotide-oligosaccharide fold (OB-fold) responsible for ssDNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B8">8</xref>) and a C-terminal domain enriched in glycine and proline residues with acidic amino acids in a hexapeptide motif (D-D-D-I/L-P-F), which is important for protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B9">9</xref>). Most bacterial SSBs function as homotetramers in which four OB-folds act together to bind to ssDNA. The crystal structure of SSB from <italic>E. coli</italic> was solved first (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B10">10</xref>), after which several crystal structures from other bacteria were described, among them an SSB from <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> (SsbA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B11">11</xref>). Two major binding modes of the SSB tetramer have been proposed. In the (SSB)<sub>35</sub> binding mode, two subunits of the <italic>E. coli</italic> tetramer bind to 35 nucleotides, whereas in the (SSB)<sub>65</sub> mode, all four subunits participate in binding to 65 nucleotides. It has been suggested that different binding modes may be used during different processes in DNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B12">12</xref>).</p><p>The biological role of paralogous SSB proteins in other bacteria is poorly studied. Transcriptional profiles of two <italic>ssb</italic> genes have been reported for <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>; in this naturally transformable bacterium, one SSB is essential, whereas the other participates in competence-related recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B13">13</xref>). A division of labour between SsbA and SsbB during genetic recombination in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> was recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B14">14</xref>). In addition, differential binding properties of SsbA and SsbB from another naturally transformable bacterium, <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, were reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B15">15</xref>).</p><p>The biological roles of paralogous SSBs in streptomycetes have not been reported until now. In this study, we have found a new and unexpected role of paralogous SSB protein in chromosomal segregation during morphological differentiation. In branching vegetative hyphae, chromosome copies are not segregated, and septation occurs unevenly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B16">16</xref>). Nutrient depletion triggers the development of aerial mycelium and the start of the reproductive phase. In the aerial hyphae, intensive chromosome replication occurs producing &#x02265;50 non-segregated linear chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B17">17</xref>). Transformation of sporogenic aerial hyphae into chains of mature unigenomic spores requires two synchronous processes: formation of sporulation septa and chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B19">19</xref>). Although progress has been made, there are still substantial gaps in understanding how dozens of linear chromosomes that are dispersed along aerial hyphae condense and accurately segregate into the nascent pre-spore compartments. Several proteins, such as FtsK<sub>SC</sub>, SMC, ParAB and ParJ, have been identified as contributing to chromosome organization and distribution during S<italic>treptomyces</italic> sporulation. Various <italic>ftsK<sub>SC</sub></italic> mutants frequently have irregular DNA content owing to large terminal deletions of the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B20">20</xref>). The <italic>smc/ftsK</italic><italic>&#x02032;</italic>-truncation alleles, produced 7&#x02013;15% of spores lacking DNA, whereas a segregation defect of 24% was observed for a <italic>smc/parB</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B22">22</xref>). Mutants lacking <italic>parA</italic>, <italic>parB</italic> or <italic>parJ</italic> produce 19, 24 and 8% of spores lacking DNA, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B23 gkt050-B24 gkt050-B25">23&#x02013;25</xref>). In summary, various combinations of mutant genes still produced viable spores, albeit at reduced frequency, suggesting that additional genes are responsible for proper chromosome segregation.</p><p>In this study, we addressed the biological role of the paralogous <italic>ssb</italic> genes in <italic>S. coelicolor</italic>, <italic>ssbA</italic> and <italic>ssbB</italic> designated in UniProtKB as <italic>ssb2</italic> and <italic>ssb1</italic>, respectively. We asked what is the driving force leading to the retention of alternative <italic>ssb</italic> genes. We found an unknown role of SsbB in chromosome segregation during reproductive growth of <italic>S. coelicolor</italic>. Consistent with the proposed cellular function of SSBs, transcriptional analysis showed that transcription of <italic>ssbB</italic> is upregulated in the later stage of growth and in a minimal medium that usually triggers spore formation. In addition, the <italic>ssbB</italic> promoter displayed unusual organizational features that might be important for its activity. Solved 3D structure of SsbB showed a unique interconnection by two S-S bridges between the A/B and C/D subunits. This is the first example of solved crystal structures of two paralogous SSB proteins from the same organism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains, plasmids and primers</title><p>The bacterial strains, plasmids, cosmids and primers used during the course of this study are listed in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt050/-/DC1">Supplementary Tables S1&#x02013;S3</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Bacterial growth conditions</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> strains NM522, ET12567 and XL1-Blue were grown in Lauria Bertaini (LB) medium at 250 r.p.m. and 37&#x000b0;C, whereas strains BW25113 (pIJ790) and BT340 at 30&#x000b0;C until induction of temperature-sensitive genes.

This construct was used to prepare all other recombinant <italic>ssbA</italic> genes used in this study. A DNA sequence containing <italic>ssbA</italic> and its upstream regulatory elements (promoter and SD sequence; pssbA) was reconstructed in the pGEM&#x000ae;-T vector and designated pGEM-pssbA, as shown (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt050/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>).

Recombination was induced with <italic>L</italic>-arabinose, and colonies carrying the recombinant cosmid were selected as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B31">31</xref>).

This cosmid, cSA01, was used to generate an in-frame &#x02018;scar&#x02019; mutation at the position of the resistance cassette. This was achieved by introducing cSA01 into <italic>E. coli</italic> BT340 (harbouring pCP20 with the Flipase gene, FLP) in which temperature-induced recombination between both FRT mutagenesis cassette-flanking regions takes place. The resulting cosmid, cSA02, had an 81 bp &#x02018;scar&#x02019; remaining in-frame with the adjacent ORF. This cosmid was used to transform <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> protoplasts carrying an additional copy of <italic>ssbA</italic> at the <italic>att B<sub>&#x003a6;BT1</sub></italic> site and the original <italic>ssbA</italic> locus. Kan<sup>R</sup> recombinants were selected and re-streaked without kanamycin. The resulting colonies were again cultured for one generation with and without antibiotic to identify loss of kanamycin resistance, i.e. double crossing over.

SCO3907 (<italic>ssbA</italic>) encodes a protein of 199 aa, whereas SCO2683 (<italic>ssbB</italic>) encodes a protein of 156 aa. The two SSB proteins share an overall 35% sequence identity, mostly conserved in the first 110 aa that contains the OB-fold ssDNA-binding domain. The C-terminal region (89 aa long) of SsbA is enriched in glycine (&#x0003e;50%), making it highly flexible and disordered. An acidic <sup>194</sup>DEPPF sequence, at the very end of this protein, is essential for interacting with proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B6">6</xref>) or with the OB-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B47">47</xref>). In SsbB, the C-terminus is reduced to 50 aa, and it lacks the acidic tail, which is highly conserved in all SSB sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B6">6</xref>).

To elucidate the biological role of SSBs in <italic>S. coelicolor</italic>, gene disruption experiments were performed as described in the &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; section.</p><p>To disrupt <italic>ssbA</italic> by semi-targeted <italic>in vitro</italic> transposon mutagenesis, we introduced h24.EO1 (apramycin resistance&#x02014;Apr<sup>R</sup>, kanamycin resistance&#x02014;Kan<sup>R</sup>) by intergeneric conjugation and selected for Apr<sup>R</sup> exconjugants. After screening 500 colonies for the Apr<sup>R</sup> Kan<sup>S</sup> phenotype indicative of integration of h24.EO1 by a double crossover event, all colonies displayed the Apr<sup>R</sup> Kan<sup>R</sup>, phenotype indicative of a single recombination event. The failure to obtain Apr<sup>R</sup> Kan<sup>S</sup> colonies suggests that either allelic exchange could not occur easily or that <italic>ssbA</italic> is an essential gene. As <italic>ssbA</italic> is clustered with genes encoding ribosomal proteins (<italic>rpsF</italic> and <italic>rpsR</italic>), a<italic>s</italic> in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> in which co-regulation of <italic>ssbA</italic> and ribosomal genes was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B13">13</xref>), we created an in-frame deletion of <italic>ssb</italic>A to allow transcription of downstream gene(s). <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> was transformed with the cSA02 where <italic>ssbA</italic> was replaced by the &#x02018;scar mutation&#x02019;, and transformants were re-streaked without kanamycin. Single colonies were tested for the Kan<sup>s</sup> phenotype indicative of a double recombination event, but none contained <italic>ssbA</italic> replaced by the &#x02018;scar&#x02019; fragment. Deletion of <italic>ssbA</italic> was successful only when an additional copy of the gene was integrated into genome at the <italic>attB<sub>&#x003a6;BT1</sub></italic> site as described in &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; section. In this case, we first selected for single-crossover mutants harbouring integrated cSA02 (Kan<sup>R</sup>). All growing colonies were re-streaked without selective pressure. Finally, 100 colonies were tested for loss of Kan<sup>R</sup>. Five sensitive colonies were verified for double crossing over by PCR. Two clones had the desired &#x02018;scar&#x02019; mutation. Based on this result, we concluded that <italic>ssbA</italic> is essential for <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> survival.</p><p>To examine the biological role of <italic>ssbB</italic>, this gene was disrupted with Tn<italic>5062</italic>. Interestingly, after 4 days of growth, the mutant strain (TSB01) displayed white aerial mycelium on MS medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt050-F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Formation of the white aerial hyphae [<italic>whi</italic> phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B49">49</xref>)] is characteristic of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> mutants that fail to develop grey pigment associated with mature spores. Further, we observed that after prolonged growth (10 days), the surface of our mutant turned light grey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt050-F2">Figure 2</xref>B), indicating that a small proportion of mutant hyphae could complete the spore maturation process. To exclude the possibility of an unpredicted polar mutation, the strain TSB01 lacking <italic>ssbB</italic> was complemented with the native gene integrated at the <italic>attB<sub>&#x003a6;BT1</sub></italic> site under the control of its own promoter. Strain TSB02, carrying this complementation vector, fully restored the original phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt050-F2">Figure 2</xref>). Occasionally, TSB02 displayed darker grey pigmentation indicating higher production of spores. We speculate that this could be ascribed to <italic>ssbB</italic> chromosome relocation that consequently changed gene expression. To check whether C-terminus of SsbB is important for DNA segregation during sporulation, we constructed TSB03 strain, i.e. mutant carrying <italic>ssbB&#x00394;C</italic> (see &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; section); synthesis of SsbB&#x00394;C in TSB03 was confirmed by western blot (not shown). This strain also exhibited white phenotype as shown for TSB01 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt050/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3A</ext-link>). Thus, this result confirmed that SsbB truncated at the C-terminus and with intact OB-fold could not restore spore maturation process. Both TSB01 and TSB03 displayed a similar phenotype on R5 medium. We observed a delay in formation of aerial mycelium and after prolonged incubation mutant colonies displayed a more pronounced pink colour (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt050/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3B</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B50">50</xref>). Microscopy analysis also showed it was more difficult to find regions with abundant spore chains in TSB01. We performed simultaneous counting of the spores collected from the wild-type and TSB01, as described in &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; section. The mean value of three independent counts for each strain showed that mutant strain produced 32.8% less spores than the wild-type strain. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt050-F3">Figure 3</xref>A1&#x02013;3, closer inspection showed that spores in the mutant strain frequently lacked DNA (30%; <italic>n</italic> = 2200) or contained excessive amounts of DNA (23%, <italic>n</italic> = 900), suggesting a defect in chromosome segregation. In contrast, the complemented strain (TSB02) displayed restoration of the wild-type phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt050-F3">Figure 3</xref>C1 and 2), with just 1% of spores lacking DNA in TSB02 compared with the wild-type 0.8&#x02013;1.1% of spores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B25">25</xref>). To exclude the possibility that observed defect is an artifact because of the difficulty in stain penetration through the spore wall, we performed <italic>in vivo</italic> staining of the <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> wild-type, TSB01, TSB02 and TSB03 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt050/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link>). Staining with DAPI showed similar results as observed previously, in TSB01 25%, TSB03 26% and wild-type 1.5% of spores were deficient in DNA (<italic>n</italic> = 800). We further examined sensitivity of the spores for the wild-type strain and TSB01, by exposing them to moderate heat and lysozyme. Although both strains displayed the same sensitivity towards heat, TSB01 showed slightly higher sensitivity towards lysozyme (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt050/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S5A</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt050/-/DC1">B</ext-link>). Statistical analysis showed that TSB01 had a slightly increased spore length and number of spores in spore chains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="gkt050-T1">Table 1</xref>). The length of the spores in TSB01 was less uniform than in the wild-type, as can be seen from the standard deviation values. An F-test was also applied and showed that TSB01 spores were significantly longer than the wild-type strain (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). The abberant distrubution of DNA in the spores and irregularly sized spores suggest that SsbB has a distinctive function for chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B18">18</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, the role of an SSB protein in DNA partitioning was not previously reported. We also observed that the strain deficient in SsbB occasionaly produced longer and coiled aerial hyphae, (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt050/-/DC1">Suplementary Figure S6</ext-link>) as previously reported for the <italic>whiA</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B51">51</xref>).

We found that &#x0223c;90% of the analysed species possess at least two <italic>ssb</italic> genes. Representative paralogous genes from each suborder belonging to five orders of Actinobacteria, and two paralogous SSBs from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> as an outgroup, were used to construct a maximum likelihood tree. Our phylogenetic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt050-F8">Figure 8</xref>) demonstrated that SsbB and SsbA are clustered separately within the orders Actinomycetales and Bifidobacteriales.

As described in &#x02018;Results&#x02019; section, we failed to disrupt <italic>ssbA</italic> with Tn<italic>5062</italic>. This gene lies between <italic>rpsF</italic> and <italic>rpsR</italic>, encoding ribosomal proteins. Conserved synteny of these genes in distantly related bacteria and coupled transcription were reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B13">13</xref>). Therefore, a polar effect caused by insertional gene replacement was anticipated, and a &#x02018;scar&#x02019; mutation at the <italic>ssbA</italic> locus was constructed. Despite this strategy, deletion of the <italic>ssbA</italic> locus was obtained only in a strain with an additional copy of the wild-type gene, indicating that <italic>ssbA</italic> is essential for <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> survival, in line with other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B13">13</xref>). In contrast, the flanking regions of <italic>ssbB</italic> with neighbouring genes are &#x0003e;200 bp, and a polar effect was not anticipated. The <italic>ssbB</italic> gene was disrupted by replacing the original chromosomal sequence with an <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> mutagenized cosmid. Numerous recombinant colonies were obtained, indicating that this gene is not essential. However, the <italic>ssbB</italic> mutant (TSB01) displayed a white phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt050-F2">Figure 2</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt050/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3A</ext-link>) and, although TSB01 differentiated on solid agar plates to form aerial hyphae, did not exibit the grey colour characteristic of mature spores. As we could restore the parental phenotype by introducing an additional copy of <italic>ssbB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt050-F2">Figure 2</xref>, strain TSB02), we concluded that the white phenotype was a consequence of the mutation in <italic>ssbB</italic>. This was unexpected and intriguing, as a role of SSB in morphological development had not been reported previously. A white phenotype is often associated with pleiotropic developmental regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B58">58</xref>). Several mutants displaying this phenotype have been studied for decades. Genes blocked at early stages (<italic>whiG</italic>, <italic>&#x02212;</italic><italic>A</italic>, <italic>&#x02013;B</italic>, <italic>&#x02013;H</italic> and <italic>&#x02013;I</italic>) are defective in sporulation septation, whereas <italic>whiD</italic> and <italic>whiE</italic> mutants are blocked in spore maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B59">59</xref>). In addition, two mutants that belong to the SsgA-like proteins (SALP family), <italic>ssgA</italic> and <italic>ssgB</italic>, also display a non-sporulating white phenotype, whereas <italic>ssgG</italic> showed, after 6 days of growth, a light grey appearance similar to the <italic>ssbB</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B58">58</xref>). However, in this mutant, the unusually large spores, three to four times normal size, with proportionally segregated chromosomes were detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B58">58</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt050-F3">Figure 3</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt050/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link>, the <italic>ssbB</italic> mutant produced spore chains with a severe nucleoid segregation defect. Unequal distribution of DNA in spore chains showed that the <italic>ssbB</italic> mutant was impaired in the segregation process rather than in replication. The percentage of spores lacking DNA in analysed spore chains was &#x0223c;30%. This is higher than for mutants in other genes associated with chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B25">25</xref>). At present, it is not easy to conclude by what mechanism SsbB participates in chromosomal partitioning. Complementation with a truncated <italic>ssbB</italic>, gene encoding protein with preserved tetramer structure, demonstrated that C-terminus of SsbB is important for its activity during chromosome segregation. Thus, we speculate that SsbB interacts and supports the function of other DNA-binding proteins known to be important for chromosomal segregation. For example, ParB binds to numerous <italic>parS</italic> sites near <italic>oriC</italic>, whereas ParA provides support for proper distribution of these nucleoprotein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B49">49</xref>). FtsK controls the partitioning of chromosome before septal closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B20">20</xref>), whereas SMC binds to DNA and promotes its condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B22">22</xref>). Single, double and triple mutations of these genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B21">21</xref>) did not completely block nucleoid segregation during sporulation; moreover, the percentage of spores lacking DNA in analysed spore chains was &#x0003c;25%. This indicates that SsbB makes an important contribution to chromosome segregation during sporulation.</p><p>Our analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="gkt050-T1">Table 1</xref>) showed that the <italic>ssbB</italic> mutant had an increased number of spores in spore chains and slightly increased spore length. Although sensitivity test towards heat and lysozyme did not show significant differences between wild-type strain and mutant (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt050/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S5</ext-link>), major changes in spore wall morphology were anticipated, and it is next task to examine this in detail. It was previously reported that strains with a DNA segregation defect caused by <italic>smc</italic>, <italic>ftsK</italic> or <italic>parB</italic> mutations produced spores that were similar in shape and size to the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B21">21</xref>). Contrary to the <italic>smc</italic>, <italic>ftsK</italic> and <italic>parB</italic> mutants, the <italic>ssbB</italic> mutant also displayed a white phenotype, and we hypothesize that our observation are due to more severe chromosome partitioning defect than those reported previously or that the <italic>ssbB</italic> mutation causes a distinct defect at a final stage of spore maturation. In any case, it will be a key challenge to clarify the role of the SsbB protein in the complex mechanism of cell division in <italic>Streptomyces</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptional profile of <italic>ssb</italic> genes correlates with their proposed biological functions</title><p>Differences in the transcriptional profile of <italic>ssb</italic> genes were in agreement with their proposed biological functions. The <italic>ssbA</italic> is expressed throughout bacterial growth, being significantly upregulated in rich medium during the logarithmic phase, whereas under starvation conditions, its expression is prolonged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt050-F4">Figure 4</xref>A2). This result corresponds to the cellular level of SsbA from <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, which is higher during intensive DNA replication in fast-growing vegetative hyphae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B13">13</xref>) and indicates that <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> SsbA might be a crucial component of DNA metabolism. Prolonged transcription of <italic>ssbA</italic> in minimal medium could be correlated to nutrient-limiting conditions that trigger aerial mycelium formation. This consequently leads to intensive replication in the apical regions of hyphae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B17">17</xref>). Transcriptional analysis clearly showed that <italic>ssbA</italic> is expressed at a much higher level than <italic>ssbB</italic> as reported for <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B13">13</xref>). Even when PCR was extended to 35 cycles, <italic>ssbB</italic> transcripts were barely detectable in rich medium, whereas in minimal medium, the gene is expressed more or less equally throughout 96 h of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt050-F4">Figure 4</xref>B). This is consistent with the proposed role of SsbB during reproductive stage of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> growth.</p><p>We also identified transcriptional start sites for <italic>ssbA</italic> and <italic>ssbB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt050-F5">Figure 5</xref>), and these results were in concert with the transcriptional starts identified independently by RNAseq (Dr. K.

McDowall, personal communication) and does not display a typical <italic>Streptomyces</italic> vegetative &#x003c3; factor consensus sequence. In contrary, the proposed distal promoter elements most closely resemble SEP-like promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B54">54</xref>). By inspecting promoter regions of <italic>ssbA</italic>, we found only short motifs that partially resembled previously described regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B54">54</xref>). Altogether this is not surprising, as streptomyces promoter regions are poorly understood and highly divergent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B52 gkt050-B53 gkt050-B54">52&#x02013;54</xref>) owing to their numerous &#x003c3; factors encoded by these organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B2">2</xref>). The promoter region of <italic>ssbB</italic> is complex and unusual. It is extremely GC rich (78.9%) in comparison with average GC content of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> promoter regions estimated to be 57&#x02013;62% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B53">53</xref>). It also possesses various repeats and palindrome sequences as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt050-F5">Figure 5</xref>. We speculate that this may indicate interactions of the promoter region with DNA-regulatory protein(s) required for the tight regulation of <italic>ssbB</italic> expression. A similar expression profile and possible promoter regulatory elements are found in other genes involved in chromosome segregation. For example, the gene-proximal promoter (P1), governing the expression of <italic>parAB</italic> throughout growth on minimal medium, displays a similar pattern of activity to <italic>ssbB</italic>, whereas the gene-distal promoter (P2) is upregulated during spore chain formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B23">23</xref>).</p><p>Unexpectedly, the <italic>ssbB</italic> promoter was active in <italic>E. coli</italic> causing filamentous growth (data not shown), as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B4">4</xref>).

Although we could not exclude the possibility that S-S bond formation had occurred during protein purification, our results clearly indicated that binding affinity had decreased significantly in the presence of DTT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt050/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S7C</ext-link>). At present, we speculate that binding activity of the SsbB might be regulated during oxidative stress in <italic>S. coelicolor</italic>, and that formation of disulphide bridges increases its binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B60">60</xref>). In addition, calculations of the free energy of the tetramer dissociation (&#x00394;G<sup>diss</sup>) showed that SsbB is the most stable of all bacterial SSB proteins described so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B11">11</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>SsbA and SsbB bind to ssDNA with different affinity</title><p>The EMSA experiment showed that SsbA and SsbB form complexes with circular &#x003a6;X1748 ssDNA. The results of this binding experiment indicated that SsbA binds to long ssDNA in a more cooperative way, as reported for SsbA from <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and SSB from <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B61">61</xref>)<italic>.</italic> In addition, cooperative binding of <italic>E. coli</italic> SSB is favoured at low salt concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B61">61</xref>). The cooperative binding mode has been proposed to function in DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B6">6</xref>). In agreement with this, our results support the predicted biological role of SsbA. Cooperative binding of SsbB was less pronounced and almost completely abolished under moderate salt concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt050-F7">Figure 7</xref>A).</p><p>Different ssDNA binding affinities to dT<sub>35</sub> were also observed for paralogous SSBs. Similarly to SSBs from <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B15">15</xref>), SsbB displayed a higher affinity for binding to shorter oligomers (dT<sub>35</sub>) than SsbA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt050-F7">Figure 7</xref>B). Interestingly, the opposite result was published recently for SsbA and SsbB from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B14">14</xref>). This discrepancy can be explained by differences in the C-terminal domain. Previous studies showed that the size of C-terminal region as well as conserved acidic tail play an important role in binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B62">62</xref>). At present, we speculate that different binding properties of <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> SSB proteins might be a consequence of their biological functions.</p></sec><sec><title>Phylogenetic analysis indicates frequent duplication and retention of <italic>ssb</italic> genes in Actinobacteria</title><p>Our results show that two paralogous genes have adopted different biological functions through evolution that possibly correlate with the complex life cycle of streptomycetes. To see whether this was confined to the genus <italic>Streptomyces</italic>, we determined the phylogeny of SSB proteins by analysing representative SSBs from related orders of the phylum Actinobacteria. Phylogenetic analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt050-F8">Figure 8</xref>) revealed that SsbA and SsbB from orders Actinomycetales and Bifidobacteriales are clustered, indicating that duplication occurred in a common ancestor. Retention of paralogs in most members of these orders indicates that these gene products have well-established roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B48">48</xref>). Although the SsbB proteins are branched together, they evolved much faster, as indicated by branch lengths. In contrast, among SsbA proteins, homology is conserved, probably reflecting their essential biological role. In the case of SSBs from <italic>S. nausensis</italic> and <italic>C. glutamicum</italic>, the third SSB, SsbC could be the result of new duplication or it could be a consequence of recent horizontal transfer. Members of other analysed orders belong to the deepest branches of Actinobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkt050-B63">63</xref>). Interestingly, their clustering might indicate that some of them underwent recent duplication, as their SSBs were grouped together. Some genomes did not retain duplicated genes or duplication did not occur.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>ACCESSION NUMBERS</title><p>PDB ID: 4DAM.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt050/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online: Supplementary Tables 1&#x02013;4, Supplementary Figures 1&#x02013;7 and Supplementary References [26,29,64&#x02013;68].</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><funding-source>Croatian Ministry of Science, Education and Sports</funding-source> grant number [<award-id>098-0982913-2877</award-id> to D.V. and <award-id>098-1191344-2943</award-id> to M.L.].
