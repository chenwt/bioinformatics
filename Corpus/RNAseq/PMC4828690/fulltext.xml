The GTPase Arf6, often overexpressed in tumors, is critical to promote epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition and invasiveness. The metabolic mevalonate pathway (MVP) is associated with tumor invasiveness and known to prenylate proteins, but which prenylated proteins are critical for MVP-driven cancers is unknown. We show here that MVP requires the Arf6-dependent mesenchymal program. The MVP enzyme geranylgeranyl transferase II (GGT-II) and its substrate Rab11b are critical for Arf6 trafficking to the plasma membrane, where it is activated by receptor tyrosine kinases. Consistently, mutant p53, which is known to support tumorigenesis via MVP, promotes Arf6 activation via GGT-II and Rab11b. Inhibition of MVP and GGT-II blocked invasion and metastasis and reduced cancer cell resistance against chemotherapy agents, but only in cells overexpressing Arf6 and components of the mesenchymal program. Overexpression of Arf6 and mesenchymal proteins as well as enhanced MVP activity correlated with poor patient survival. These results provide insights into the molecular basis of MVP-driven malignancy.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="sp1"><funding-source>Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture of Japan<named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">23112008</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group id="sp2"><funding-source>Takeda Science Foundation<named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007449</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group id="sp3"><funding-source>Mitsubishi Foundation<named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004398</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group id="sp4"><funding-source>Akiyama Life Science Foundation<named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007591</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group id="sp5"><funding-source>Kobayashi Foundation for Cancer Research<named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002002</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp5">13-24517</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s01"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mevalonate pathway (MVP) has long been recognized as an excellent target of cancer therapeutics, partly as a result of its activity to prenylate and hence activate small GTPases, including members of the Ras and Rho family, which are key players in oncogenesis and cancer malignancy (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Goldstein and Brown, 1990</xref>). MVP is involved in a wide variety of aspects of cell regulation under both normal and disease conditions (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Yeganeh et al., 2014</xref>). Statins are inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), a rate-limiting enzyme of MVP, and were originally developed to lower cholesterol levels, such as in cardiovascular disease (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Endo et al., 1976</xref>). However, in spite of such potentials of statins, which inhibit the activities of Ras and Rho family members, many clinical trials showed that statins on their own or even in combination with other drugs or with radiation therapy did not always effectively treat cancers (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Jukema et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Yeganeh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Altwairgi, 2015</xref>). Therefore, the general functions of MVP, which may play roles in most cancer cells, might not be crucial for promoting cancer malignancy. However, MVP inhibitors might still become very effective therapeutics for cancer if they are combined with biomarkers to identify the &#x0201c;responders&#x0201d; (see the last paragraph of Introduction and the last paragraph of Discussion).</p><p>An example of the critical roles played by MVP in breast cancer was recently shown in detail. Gain-of-function mutants of p53 may interact with the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 to up-regulate the transcription of genes involved in fatty acid and sterol biosynthetic pathways, including MVP (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Freed-Pastor et al., 2012</xref>). Through the up-regulation of MVP activity, mutant p53 enhances the invasiveness of breast cancer cells, such as MDA-MB-231 (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Freed-Pastor et al., 2012</xref>), which expresses R280K mutant p53 and has lost the other <italic>TP53</italic> allele (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Wasielewski et al., 2006</xref>). However, although MDA-MB-468 cells also express mutant p53 (R273H), which up-regulates MVP, the up-regulation of MVP by mutant p53 in this cell line did not promote invasiveness but only disrupted the cell morphology (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Freed-Pastor et al., 2012</xref>). These results clearly demonstrate that MVP, as well as its enhanced activity, can be linked to cancer invasiveness, although this link seems to depend on cell contexts, even within the same type of cancer. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms by which certain breast cancer cells respond to the enhanced activity of MVP to promote invasiveness remain unidentified.</p><p>The small GTPase Arf6 and its signaling proteins are frequently overexpressed in different types of cancers, such as breast cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and constitute a pathway promoting invasion and metastasis by down-regulating E-cadherin&#x02013;based cell&#x02013;cell adhesion and up-regulating recycling of &#x003b2;1 integrins (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Hashimoto et al., 2004a</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Onodera et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Morishige et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Menju et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kinoshita et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Sato et al., 2014</xref>). In this pathway, Arf6 is activated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as EGF receptor (EGFR) via GEP100 (also called BRAG2) in breast cancer cells (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Morishige et al., 2008</xref>), whereas Arf6 is activated by lysophosphatidic acid receptors via EFA6 in clear cell renal cancer cells (ccRCCs; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hashimoto et al., 2016</xref>). Activated Arf6 then recruits AMAP1 (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Onodera et al., 2005</xref>). We have recently identified that EPB41L5, which is expressed exclusively in mesenchymal cells under normal conditions and acts to promote cell motility and focal adhesion dynamics (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hirano et al., 2008</xref>), is an integral binding partner of AMAP1 for invasion and metastasis (unpublished data). Thus, this Arf6-based pathway is a cancer-specific mesenchymal-type signaling pathway. It should be noted that Arf6 is acylated but is not prenylated and hence is not a direct target of the MVP activity.</p><p>Possibly related to the results by <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Freed-Pastor et al. (2012)</xref>, it should be noted that MDA-MB-231 cells overexpress Arf6 and its signaling components, including the mesenchymal-specific EPB41L5, and use them for invasion and metastasis, whereas MDA-MB-468 cells express these molecules at marginal levels (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Hashimoto et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Onodera et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, several studies have shown that the acquisition of mesenchymal properties by cancer cells, particularly breast cancer cells, is significantly associated with their resistance to therapeutic drugs (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Tryndyak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Fischer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>), although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unidentified. Here, we investigated whether MVP activity is involved in activation of the Arf6-based mesenchymal pathway, with the aim to identify a key link between MVP and cancer malignancy. For this purpose, we primarily used breast cancer cells, in which the roles of MVP and the overexpressed Arf6 pathway, as well as the acquisition of mesenchymal properties in the development of malignancy (particularly drug resistance), have been well documented. Our results revealed the molecular basis as to why MVP inhibitors are highly effective against only a certain population of cancer cells and proposed biomarkers that might be useful for identifying cancer cells that are highly sensitive to the inhibition of MVP activity, such as by statins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s02"><title>Results</title><sec id="s03"><title>TGF&#x003b2;1 activates Arf6 via trans-activating c-Met to promote invasiveness</title><p>Both the activity of MVP up-regulated by mutant p53 and the Arf6-based pathway activated by RTKs were reported to be crucial for the enhanced invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells, as mentioned in the second and third paragraphs of the Introduction. Moreover, TGF&#x003b2;1 signaling was also pivotal for the enhanced invasiveness of this cell line (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adorno et al., 2009</xref>). To understand the precise roles of MVP in this enhanced invasiveness, we first investigated the association of these events and found that TGF&#x003b2;1 activates Arf6 in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>), as assessed by the GGA pull-down assay. siRNA-mediated <italic>Arf6</italic> silencing abolished the TGF&#x003b2;1-induced invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201510002/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>).

Cell viability was not notably affected under these conditions (Fig. S1 B). Therefore, TGF&#x003b2;1 signaling appears to use the Arf6 pathway to promote the invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells.</p><fig id="fig1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><?Figure Med?><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>TGF&#x003b2;1 activates Arf6 to promote the invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells.</bold> (A) Arf6 activities upon the stimulation of serum-starved cells by TGF&#x003b2;1 for the indicated times were measured by detecting Arf6-GTP and total Arf6 by anti-Arf6 immunoblotting.

HGF on its own was able to activate Arf6 and cell invasion, whereas these activations were abolished by the silencing of <italic>GEP100</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). <italic>AMAP1</italic> silencing also blocked HGF-induced cell invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). However, TGF&#x003b2;1 only marginally activated EGFR in these cells (Fig. S1 D). Consistently, the c-Met inhibitor PHA665752 blocked TGF&#x003b2;1-induced Arf6 activation and cell invasion almost completely, without affecting Smad2 phosphorylation or cell viability (Fig. S1, E&#x02013;H). c-Met uses Gab1 in its intracellular signaling. Silencing of <italic>Gab1</italic> blocked TGF&#x003b2;1-induced Arf6 activation and cell invasion without affecting cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, E and F</xref>; and Fig. S1, I and J). We also confirmed that c-Met and GEP100 are coprecipitated with Gab1 upon HGF stimulation (Fig. S1 K) and that the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of GEP100, fused to GST, precipitated Gab1 and c-Met upon TGF&#x003b2;1 stimulation (Fig. S1 L). Therefore, it is likely that via the trans-activation of c-Met, TGF&#x003b2;1 activates Arf6 in MDA-MB-231 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s04"><title>Mutant p53 is critical for the activation of Arf6 but not c-Met</title><p>We then analyzed the association between mutant p53 and ligand-induced Arf6 activation. Silencing of mutant p53 in MDA-MB-231 cells (resulting in shp53 cells) was shown to block TGF&#x003b2;1-induced invasion (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adorno et al., 2009</xref>). We previously generated shp53 cells expressing normal p53 (shp53/wild-type [wt] cells), as well as shp53 cells expressing the oncogenic p53 mutants R175H, R249S, and R273H and the rescue construct of R280K (shp53/R175H cells, shp53/R249S cells, shp53/R273H cells, and shp53/R280K cells, respectively; unpublished data). These exogenous p53 proteins were tagged with V5. We here found that TGF&#x003b2;1-induced Arf6 activation and cell invasion are substantially abolished in shp53 cells and shp53/wt cells, but not in cells expressing mutant p53 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Similar results were also observed upon EGF and HGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). However, TGF&#x003b2;1-induced phosphorylation of c-Met (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>) and the ligand-induced activation of RTKs and Akt occurred even in shp53 cells and shp53/wt cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201510002/DC1" id="supp2">Fig. S2 A</ext-link>). This association of GEP100 with EGFR also occurred in these cells upon EGF stimulation (Fig. S2 B). Therefore, different mutant p53 proteins are involved in ligand-induced Arf6 activation. However, these results showed that mutant p53 proteins are dispensable to the trans-activation of c-Met by TGF&#x003b2;1. Moreover, the ability of R280K to promote Arf6 activation and cell invasion appeared to be primarily dependent on its transcriptional activity, as its transcription-dead mutant (txn-dead R280K) was unable to restore these activities (Fig. S2, C and D).</p><fig id="fig2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><?Figure Large?><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Mutant p53 is crucial for ligand-induced Arf6 activation but not for the trans-activation of c-Met.</bold> (A and B) Arf6 activation (A) and Matrigel invasion (B), induced by EGF, HGF, or TGF&#x003b2;1, as indicated, were measured in MDA-MB-231 cells (parental) and their p53 derivatives.

We also performed time-lapse fluorescence image recording and found that Rab11b is transported together with Arf6 in the cytoplasm before and after stimulation, although Rab11b appeared to separate from Arf6 before Arf6 reaches the PM (Fig. S3 D and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201510002/DC1" id="supp5">Video 1</ext-link>). We confirmed that the colocalization of Rab11b with Arf6 was unaffected, even when different tags were used for each of these small GTPases (Fig. S3 E). We furthermore confirmed that these tagged proteins are not excessively overexpressed by performing immunoblotting analysis (Fig. S3 F).</p><p>Using a Triton X114&#x02013;based fractionation method with MDA-MB-231 cells, we confirmed that Simvastatin dramatically increases the amounts of HA-Rab11b (wt) recovered within the soluble fraction (S), whereas HA-Rab11b in these cells was recovered mostly within the detergent-insoluble membrane fraction (M; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 H</xref>).

Furthermore, the originally known function of wt p53 to suppress SREBP activity appeared to be recaptured in our results, in which higher amounts of Rab11b were recovered in the soluble fraction in shp53/wt cells than in shp53 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 J</xref>). These results show that MVP and GGT-II are essential for the function of Rab11b and also support the notion that mutant p53 acts to increase the amounts of functional Rab11b proteins, whereas wt p53 acts to limit Rab11b activity and hence limit the activation of Arf6 by external ligands.</p></sec><sec id="s08"><title>Mutant p53 does not affect lipid rafts</title><p>MVP leads to the biosynthesis of cholesterol, which, together with other lipids such as sphingolipids, forms discrete heterogenous microdomains termed lipid rafts.

We used HMLE cells, which are immortalized normal mammary epithelial cells (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Elenbaas et al., 2001</xref>). The culture medium for these cells contains a basal amount of EGF to maintain their viability, which prevented us from starving the cells of EGF.

Moreover, a similar cytoplasmic redistribution of Arf6 was observed by treatment of HMLE cells with Simvastatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>).

The Arf6 pathway includes mesenchymal-specific EPB41L5, which is expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells and MDA-MB-435s cells at high levels (unpublished data). A fundamental function of EPB41L5 is to down-regulate E-cadherin (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hirano et al., 2008</xref>); the down-regulation of E-cadherin is a hallmark feature that leads to anoikis resistance and may thereby also lead to the drug resistance of cancer cells (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Frisch et al., 2013</xref>). We hence investigated whether EPB41L5, as well as the Arf6 pathway, contributes to the drug resistance of breast cancer cells. Gemcitabine is a cytidine analogue, and Temsirolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin activity (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Maring et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Grunt and Mariani, 2013</xref>).

We then found that Simvastatin also significantly improves the drug sensitivities of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, C and D</xref>). Such effects were observed at concentrations of 10 nM or lower for Simvastatin, as well as for Gemcitabine and Temsirolimus. However, such improvement by Simvastatin was not at all observed in MDA-MB-468 cells and MCF7 cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201510002/DC1" id="supp6">Fig. S5, A and B</ext-link>), which do not overexpress components of the Arf6 pathway (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Hashimoto et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Onodera et al., 2005</xref>).

It is hence conceivable that the enhancement of MVP activity, such as by mutant p53, greatly assists in the efficient activation of overexpressed Arf6 and its signaling pathway under enhanced RTK signaling through enhancement of the geranylgeranylation of Rab11, which then facilitates the intracellular trafficking of Arf6 proteins to the PM to be activated by RTKs.</p><p>Our results suggest that co-overexpression of <italic>EPB41L5</italic> and <italic>HMGCR</italic> mRNAs provides a biomarker predictive for breast cancer cells that can be highly reactive to MVP inhibition. Immunohistochemical detection of their protein products might also show similar results, as these mRNAs appear structurally to belong to &#x0201c;strong&#x0201d; mRNAs that are immediately translated into proteins upon transcription (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">De Benedetti and Graff, 2004</xref>). The 5-yr survival rates of breast cancer patients have reached &#x0003e;80% in several medically advanced countries (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Coleman et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, effects of the possible cooperation of enhanced MVP activity and the overexpressed Arf6 pathway appear to manifest 5 yr or so after the diagnosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, F and G</xref>). Activities of MVP change dynamically under various physiological conditions, such as by cholesterol intake and estrogen levels (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Goldstein and Brown, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Faulds et al., 2012</xref>). However, <italic>TP53</italic> mutations may account for only a small population of the high <italic>HMGCR</italic> expression group of primary breast tumors (Fig. S5, G and H), despite the fact that <italic>TP53</italic> mutations are very frequent in breast cancer cells with highly aggressive phenotypes, i.e., the basal-like genotype cells (80%; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012</xref>). In this regard, it should be noted that <italic>TP53</italic> mutations are infrequent in other types of breast cancer cells, such as the luminal A genotype (12%) and the luminal B genotype (29%; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012</xref>). Thus, it would be interesting to investigate the types of nutritional as well as hormonal conditions of patients that may respond well to the inhibition of MVP and GGT-II. However, it should also be noted that animal experiments revealed that statins administrated orally selectively accumulate in the liver (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Duggan et al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Vickers et al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Nezasa et al., 2002</xref>), whereas statins can be delivered to target organs by other methods, including intraarterial infusion, as well as direct infusion into mammary ducts in the case of breast cancer.</p><p>We recently found that ccRCCs also frequently overexpress components of the Arf6 pathway, overexpression which is tightly associated with the poor outcomes of patients (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hashimoto et al., 2016</xref>). In ccRCCs, however, Arf6 is activated by EFA6, but not GEP100, under G protein&#x02013;coupled receptors (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hashimoto et al., 2016</xref>). Consistently, we found that statins were not highly effective in reducing the drug resistance of ccRCC cell lines (unpublished data). Moreover, we still do not know the precise molecular mechanisms as to how EPB41L5 and also the Arf6-based pathway enhance the drug resistance of cancer cells. It is possible that the involvement of EPB41L5 and the Arf6 pathway, as well as the enhanced activities of MVP promoting Arf6 activation, in drug resistance depends on the cell context. The degree of involvement might also vary depending on the types of cancers and on the different genomic mutations in different cancer cells. Therefore, a detailed understanding of these mechanisms will be necessary to further ensure the effective use of MVP inhibitors in clinical settings.</p><p>In conclusion, our results suggested that blocking the activities of MVP, particularly blocking GGT-II, may effectively kill cancer cells that overexpress the Arf6-based mesenchymal pathway (i.e., the responders) when appropriately combined with other therapeutics and perhaps also with particular patient conditions and genome status of cancer cells. Blocking these enzymatic activities of the responder cells on their own may also effectively block their motility and invasiveness. Furthermore, consistent with the reported functions of statins (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Yeganeh et al., 2014</xref>), such blockage is expected to effectively inhibit tumor angiogenesis, as overexpressed Arf6 and AMAP1 are also essential for this process (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hashimoto et al., 2011</xref>). We hence propose that clinical usefulness of statins for cancer therapy should be reevaluated using the biomarkers that we have identified in this paper to be predictive of the responders of cancer cells. In addition to statins, GGT-II inhibitors that can be administered safely to humans may have high potential to be developed as cancer therapeutics (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Berndt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>), although to date, the development of safe GGT-II inhibitors has been unsuccessful because of the serious side effects of the conventional method of GGT inhibition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s14"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s15"><title>Cell lines</title><p>MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435s, Hs578T, MDA-MB-468, and MCF7 cells were obtained from ATCC.

All of these steps were performed at 4&#x000b0;C. 10 ml of each fraction was then separated by 8% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using an anti&#x02013;Flotillin-1 antibody (610820; BD). For measuring total cellular cholesterol levels, cells grown on a 6-well dish were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and scraped with 100 &#x000b5;l of ice-cold lysis solution (2% <italic>n</italic>-octyl-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-glucoside, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 20 mM sodium fluoride, and 5% glycerol) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail. Lysates were then collected into new tubes, mixed well, and clarified by centrifugation at 4&#x000b0;C for 10 min. The amounts of cholesterol in the resulting supernatants containing 1 mg of protein were measured using a cholesterol assay kit (Amplex Red; Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s31"><title>Metastasis assay</title><p>Nu/Nu athymic mice were obtained from Central Laboratory for Experimental Animals Japan. All experiments were conducted under a protocol approved by the animal care committee of Hokkaido University. MDA-MB-231 cells were lentivirally infected with pLenti CMV V5-Luc blast (21474; Addgene) and pLKO.1-puro shRNA constructs bearing shRNA sequences to knock down <italic>Rab11b</italic>, which were purchased from an shRNA library (TRCN00000381919; Mission; Sigma-Aldrich). A scrambled shRNA (1864; Addgene) was used as a control. We tried in vain to silence <italic>GGT-II</italic> by shRNA constructs, which were purchased from an shRNA library (TRCN00000299714; Mission). A total of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells were injected into the lateral tail vein of each female athymic nude mouse at 5 wk of age. For Simvastatin treatment, MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing the luciferase gene were pretreated with 1 &#x000b5;M Simvastatin or with a control PBS solution for 2 d before injection. After injection, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 5 mg/kg body weight of Simvastatin or with a control PBS solution every day for 28 d. For bioluminescence imaging, mice were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane and injected intraperitoneally with 150 mg/kg body weight of <sc>d</sc>-luciferin in PBS. At 10 min after the injection, bioluminescence was detected with an in vivo imaging system (Xenogen) and analyzed with living-image software (Xenogen). Photon flux (photons/seconds/square centimeters/steradian) was calculated for each mouse using a region of interest encompassing the thorax. This value was normalized with a comparable background value. For histology, lungs were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Wako Pure Chemical Industries). Sections were stained with hematoxylin using standard procedures by Morpho Technology.</p></sec><sec id="s32"><title>Drug resistance assay</title><p>Gemcitabine and Temsirolimus were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively. In the <italic>EPB41L5</italic> knockdown experiment, cells pretreated with siRNAs specific for <italic>EPB41L5</italic> or a control oligonucleotide for 24 h were plated onto 96-well culture plates at 3,000 cells per well, and drugs were applied on the next day.
