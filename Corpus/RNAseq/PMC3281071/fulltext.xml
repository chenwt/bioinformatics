However, transcriptional regulation of vascular endothelial cells by thrombin is not completely understood. In the present study, Illumina RNA-seq was used to profile the transcriptome in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-L) treated with thrombin for 6 h to gain insight into thrombin's direct effects on the endothelial function. Out of 100 million total reads from a paired end sequencing assay, 91&#x02013;94&#x00025; of the reads were aligned to over 16,000 genes in the reference human genome. Thrombin upregulated 150 known genes and 480 known isoforms, and downregulated 2,190 known genes and 3,574 known isoforms by at least 2 fold. Of note, thrombin upregulated 1,775 previously unknown isoforms and downregulated 12,202 previously unknown isoforms by at least 2 fold. Many genes displayed isoform specific differential expression levels and different usage of transcriptional start sites after the thrombin treatment. The cross comparisons between our RNA-seq data and those of DNA microarray analysis of either 6 h thrombin treated HUVEC or 5 h TNF&#x003b1; treated HMVEC have provided a significant overlapping list of differentially expressed genes, supporting the robust utility of our dataset. Further in-depth follow-up analysis of the transcriptional regulation reported in this study may shed light on molecular pathogenic mechanisms underlying thrombin mediated endothelial dysfunction in various diseases and provide new leads of potential therapeutic targets.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Endothelial cells lining the inner surface of microvessels form a semipermeable barrier that actively participates in blood&#x02013;tissue exchange of plasma fluid, proteins and cells. The precise regulation of endothelial barrier and function is essential for maintaining circulatory homeostasis and the physiological function of different organs. The dysregulation of microvascular barrier and function represent crucial events in the development of a variety of disease processes, such as adult respiratory distress syndrome, ischemia&#x02013;reperfusion injury, diabetic vascular complications, and tumor metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031229-Kumar1">[1]</xref>.</p><p>It is now understood that while increased circulating levels of soluble mediators such as thrombin, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF&#x003b1;, and immune cells such as neutrophils are a hallmark of host defense against injury, most of these mediators target the vascular endothelium to produce vasoactive and cytotoxic effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031229-Kumar1">[1]</xref>. Thrombin is a serine protease. Besides its central role in the coagulation cascade acting as both a coagulant factor and an anticoagulant factor, thrombin can trigger important cellular effects via a protease-activated receptor pathway or receptor independent pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031229-Tsopanoglou1">[2]</xref>. Thrombin can stimulate endothelial cells and regulate the expression, release and activation of a number of biological mediators. Thrombin is known for its endothelial hyperpermeability effect. Thrombin can protect endothelial cells from apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031229-Zania1">[3]</xref>.. Thrombin plays an important role in angiogenesis and is thus involved in tumor progression and metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031229-Nash1">[4]</xref>. The list of physiological and pathological roles of thrombin is still expanding. The understanding of these events at a molecular level will provide new targets of therapeutic interventions in disease states.</p><p>With the advent of next generation DNA sequencing technologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031229-Davey1">[5]</xref>, such as RNA-seq, a more comprehensive and accurate transcriptome analysis has become feasible and affordable. RNA-seq first sequences complementary DNA (cDNA) in short fragments and subsequent mapping of such short sequence fragments (reads) onto the reference genome. RNA-Seq enables identification of transcription initiation sites (TSSs) and new splicing variants, and it permits a precise quantitative determination of exon and splicing isoform expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031229-Marioni1">[6]</xref>. In the present study, we performed a comprehensive transcriptome analysis in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-L) treated with or without thrombin using the Illumina RNA-Seq technique. We found significant differences in gene isoform expression levels, alternated use of promoters and transcription start sites between control and thrombin treated HMVEC-L. These data provided broader and deeper insights into thrombin's transcriptional regulation on the vascular endothelial functions and it also provides rich reagents for further experimentations.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Quality analysis of RNA-Seq data</title><p>Real-time analysis of the sequencing run, including several measurements, was performed by the Illumina HiSeq Control Software. Clusters of identical sequences were generated on the Illumina cBot and the number of those clusters was reported, along with the percentage of those clusters passing an internal quality filter. Across the 5 samples, between 599,000 and 621,000 raw clusters were detected, with a median of 603,000 clusters per lane. Between 89.5&#x00025; and 92.1&#x00025; of those clusters passed the filter, with a median of 91.3&#x00025; of the clusters passing the filter. Each lane was aligned in real-time with the PhiX genome and between 0.6&#x00025; and 0.7&#x00025; of the clusters aligned. Our control lane of PhiX produced 357,000 clusters with 96.9&#x00025; passing the filter and 99.1&#x00025; aligning to the PhiX genome. All these values were within the recommended limits established by Illumina.</p><p>Post-run quality analysis of RNA-Seq Data was carried out as described by Twine et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031229-Twine1">[7]</xref>. The total number of reads produced from each sample was between 97,478,180 and 105,351,222, with a median across all samples of 102,568,132 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0031229-t001">Table 1</xref>). The difference in the number of reads between the control samples and the thrombin samples was not statistically significant (Student's t-test, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.88). To assess the quality of the reads, data was pulled from the TopHat log files as well as the output files. Between 0.31&#x00025; and 0.34&#x00025; of the reads were removed due to low quality before mapping to the reference genome began. Between 88.4&#x00025; and 94.2&#x00025; of the total reads mapped to the human genome. To ensure the uniform coverage across the genome, the data was visualized using a local copy of the Integrative Genomics Viewer. We mapped the control A reads against chromosome 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031229-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The average alignment was computed across the genome and those alignment scores were log-transformed (base 2) to better visualize the full range of the data. As expected, no reads mapped to the centromere or areas of the chromosome without genes.</p><fig id="pone-0031229-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0031229.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>A transcription profile of HMVEC cells (Control A) for chromosome 1.</title><p>The RNASeq read density plotted along chromosome 1 is shown.

The expanded list of top 50 up- and down- regulated known isoforms in thrombin treated HMVEC cells are presented in the supplement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031229.s002">Table S2</xref>).

The fold change among top 50 down- regulated known isoforms in thrombin treated HMVEC cells varies from &#x02212;24 to &#x02212;1455. Consistent with the finding that PCDHA1 and PCDHA11 are the top regulated genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0031229-t001">Table 1</xref>), both genes are among the top regulated known isoforms in thrombin treated HMVEC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031229-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031229.s002">Table S2</xref>). Another two known isoforms of the protocadeherin gene family [protocadherin gamma gene B6 (PCDHGB6) and PCDHA3] were also upregulated by 82 and 22 fold, respectively. One of the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene isoforms was the highest upregulated isoform (983 fold) by thrombin. HFE is known to be involved in iron metabolism. It may also be involved in a tissue injury and reparative process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031229-Zamboni1">[8]</xref>. Phospholipase C- beta 4 (PLCB4) was the highest down regulated isoform (&#x02212;1455 fold) by thrombin. Phospholipase C-beta hydrolyses phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and generates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in response to activation of various G protein-coupled receptors. PLCB4 was implicated in the delayed [Ca2&#x0002b;]i increase in response to the stimulation by thrombin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031229-Hwang1">[9]</xref>. Among the top ten up- and down-regulated known gene isoforms by thrombin are three presumable transcription factors (runt-related transcription factor 1, forkhead box P2, zinc finger and BTB domain containing 20) and two ion channel gene isoforms (sodium channel and voltage-gated type IV beta, and sodium/calcium exchanger member 3). Two different isoforms of the gene <italic>ZBTB20</italic> are listed among the top ten down-regulated known gene isoforms by thrombin.

In addition, a qRT-PCR experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031229-g006">Figure 6</xref>) on three randomly selected genes (TRAF1, CELF1, FANCD2) confirmed our results from RNA-seq. This adds more weight to the credibility of our RNA-seq data in this study.</p><p>Although thrombin is known for its central role in the coagulation cascade acting as both a coagulant factor and an anticoagulant factor, thrombin can trigger important cellular effects via a protease-activated receptor pathway or receptor independent pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031229-Tsopanoglou1">[2]</xref>. The list of physiological and pathological roles of thrombin is expanding. In the present study, we performed a comprehensive transcriptome analysis in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-L) treated with or without thrombin using the Illumina RNA-seq technique. The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive gene expression profile of HMVEC-L treated with thrombin to gain a complete picture of the transcriptional regulation of vascular endothelial cells by thrombin since the dysregulation of vascular endothelial cells by different agonists including thrombin has been implicated in the development of a number of pathologic disorders, such as inflammatory conditions, cancer, diabetes and coronary heart diseases. Thrombin plays an important role in vascular inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031229-Popovic1">[11]</xref>. However, the full repertoire of players and signal transduction pathways of this process are not completely understood. We found that TNF receptor-associated factor 1 and chemokine C-X3-C motif ligand 1 (C-X3-CL1), both of which are involved in inflammatory response, were among the top ten upregulated genes by thrombin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031229-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Inflammatory response is among the top networks and canonical pathways of both upregulated genes and isoforms by the thrombin treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0031229-t004">Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0031229-t006">6</xref>). These results corroborate the role of thrombin in vascular inflammation, but more importantly, they have provided a complete list of differentially expressed genes after thrombin treatment, as well as, full components in the top affected network and canonical pathway of inflammatory response. By examining differentially expressed genes in a traditional thrombin signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031229-g004">Figure 4</xref>), we found that thrombin receptor, Par 4 not Par 1, was up-regulated at the 6 h thrombin treatment. This makes sense since Par 1 is involved in an early response and Par 4 is involved in an later response of Thrombin. PARs contribute to the proinflammatory phenotype observed in endothelial dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031229-Martorell1">[20]</xref>. Along the same line, expression of NF&#x003ba;B was significantly up-regulated at the 6 h thrombin treatment. NF-&#x003ba;B has been documented as the key regulator of inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031229-Barnes1">[21]</xref>. The up-regulated Par4- and NF-&#x003ba;B-mediated effects may in part contribute to the thrombin mediated inflammatory response as a major affected transcriptional network or pathway in this study although other genes in this traditionally annotated thrombin pathway were either down-regulated or not affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031229.s004">Table S4</xref>). Several protocadherin alpha members such as PCDHA1, PCDHA3 and PCDHA11 were among top upregulated genes by thrombin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031229-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031229.s002">Table S2</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031229-g005">Figure 5</xref> displays a full spectrum of differential regulations of protocadherin alpha 1 to 13 by thrombin. Protocadherins are an important subfamily of the cadherin superfamily proteins. They are calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecules. They are also involved in many biological processes, including cell recognition and cell signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031229-Morishita1">[22]</xref>. Network analysis of the top differentially regulated genes indicate that Cell-To-Cell Signaling and Interaction, Tissue Morphology, and Cellular Movement are among the top affected networks by the thrombin treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0031229-t004">Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0031229-t005">5</xref>). These observations provide a transcriptional level support and insight into known roles of thrombin that can regulate cell-cell junctions between endothelial cells as well as cytoskeleton contraction. Thrombin is also recognized as a potent mitogen in cancer and tumor metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031229-Bahou1">[17]</xref>. We found that DNA Double-Strand Break Repair and BRCA1 in DNA Damage Response were the top canonical pathways of downregulated genes/isoforms after thrombin treatment of HMVEC cells (Table 9). Dysfunction of the DNA repair pathway is among the major causes of tumorogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031229-Shaheen1">[16]</xref>. Our observation may provide new molecular mechanisms underlying thrombin in the tumor pathogenesis.</p><p>Previously, DNA microarray analysis has been performed to profile gene expression pattern in human vascular endothelial cells treated with thrombin. By comparing the RNA-seq data from this study to those by Uzonyi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031229-Uzonyi1">[23]</xref> in which gene expression profile of 6 h thrombin treated HUVEC was assayed by Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array, we found that 38 genes were consistently up-regulated and 395 genes were consistently down-regulated in both datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031229.s007">Table S7</xref>). Many of the changes we observed in gene expression between control and thrombin group were similar to those reported. For example, the upregulation trend of several inflammatory response genes (CX3CL1, 6.05 fold; VCAM1, 4.75 fold; ICAM1, 3.29 fold; IL6, 2.27 fold; NF&#x003ba;B2, 2.02 fold) in thrombin treated HMVEC-L cells revealed by RNA-seq in this study is the same as that detected using DNA microarray array (CX3CL1, 1.39 fold; VCAM1, 4.16 fold; ICAM1, 3.14 fold; IL6, 1.34 fold; NF&#x003ba;B2, 1.41 fold) by Uzonyi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031229-Uzonyi1">[23]</xref>. Generally, RNA-seq is much more sensitive than DNA microarray to detect the magnitude of difference in differentially expressed genes after the thrombin treatment. Some highly expressed genes or isoforms such as AS3MT (6.96 fold &#x02191;) and PCDHA11 (58.5 fold &#x02191;) as well as lowly expressed genes and isoforms in this study were not detected in DNA microarray <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031229-Uzonyi1">[23]</xref>. Although the slightly different cell type and old DNA microarray chips may be contributing factors to some of the disconcordance between our RNA-seq transcriptome data set and the result of DNA microarray, these differences most likely stem from inherent limitations in microarray systems. We also compared the data from this study to those by Viemann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031229-Viemann1">[24]</xref> in which gene expression profile of 5 h TNF&#x003b1; treated HMVEC was assayed by Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array. We found that 49 genes were consistently up-regulated and 264 genes were consistently down-regulated in both datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031229.s008">Table S8</xref>). TNF&#x003b1; plays an important pathogenetic role in inflammatory disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031229-BenNeriah1">[25]</xref>. Several upregulated genes known to be invovled in the inflammatory response such as NF&#x003ba;B2, VCAM1, ICAM1, IL6, IL8, TNFRSF9 were similarly detected in 5 h TNF&#x003b1; treated HMVEC and 6 h thrombin treated HMVEC in our study though the reported magnitude of increased expressions were different. These cross comparisons between our RNA-seq data and those of DNA microarray analysis of either 6 h thrombin treated HUVEC or 5 h TNF&#x003b1; treated HMVEC have provided a significant overlapping list of differentially expressed genes, supporting the robust utility of our dataset. One notable advantage of RNA-seq is that it can measure the less abundant transcripts that are inaccurate or not detected by microarray. RNA-seq also enabled the detection of unknown RNAs, alternative spliced transcripts and alternative promoter usages which are not feasible by microarray <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031229-Marioni1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031229-Bradford1">[26]</xref>. Indeed, our RNA-Seq study reveals nearly 1/3 of the differentially expressed RNA transcripts are unannotated, while about 26,000 novel isoforms are detected. Among those novel isoforms, 418 were only detected in the control cells, while 424 were only detected in thrombin treated cells. The differentially expressed novel isoforms in thrombin treated cells over the controls with statistically significant fold changes ranged from &#x02212;927.74 to 431.33. There are 1,775 upregulated- and 12,202 downregulated- novel isoforms in thrombin treated cells by at least a 2 fold change over the control cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0031229-t002">Table 2</xref>). This study has provided rich reagents for further experimentation.</p><p>It should be pointed out that one limitation of our study is the one time point, 6 h, of the thrombin treatment. The reason we selected 6 h of thrombin treatment was based on at least the following three references: 1). Simoncini et al. showed that thrombin mediated upregulation of T<italic>NFSF10</italic> (<italic>TRAIL</italic>), a TNF-&#x003b1; superfamily inflammatory cytokine that displays multiple effects on endothelial cells, started to peak at 6 h time point in both human microvascular endothelial cells and HUVEC as quantified by real-time PCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031229-Simoncini1">[27]</xref>. 2). Moser et al. showed that a 6 h thrombin treatment significantly enhanced the adhesive interaction of neutrophils to HUVEC as IL-1, TNF and LPS did compared to those of the 5 min thrombin treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031229-Moser1">[28]</xref>. A transendothelial neutrophil passage is one of hallmark features in the inflammatory process. 3) Liu et al. employed a 6 h thrombin treatment to investigate thrombin mediated myocyte-specific enhancer factor-2 (MEF2)-dependent gene transcription of endothelial cells in angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031229-Liu1">[29]</xref>. Our data from this study have provided a valuable global picture on the thrombin mediated up-regulation and down-regulation of multiple genes in the endothelium at the 6 h thrombin treatment as discussed above. Nevertheless, previous studies have showed that of the genes that were induced by thrombin, some peaked at 1 hour, some at 4 hours, and some at 18 hours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031229-Minami1">[30]</xref>. Our study with 6 h thrombin treatment failed to detect early and late thrombin response genes. It is certainly warranted that a series of time course experiments of thrombin treatment should be carried out to systematically survey the transcriptional regulation of thrombin on endothelial cells to provide more complete and dynamic datasets using the new and powerful RNA-seq technology. A better understanding of the temporal dynamics of these thrombin regulated transcriptional networks may help to decipher the link between thrombin signaling in the endothelium and multiple phenotypic changes.</p><p>In summary, our first complete transcriptome analysis of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells treated with thrombin using the RNA-seq has provided important insights into the transcriptional regulation of gene expression in HMVEC-L cells by thrombin. Further in-depth follow-up analysis of the transcriptional regulation reported in this study may shed light on molecular mechanisms underlying thrombin mediated endothelial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of inflammatory conditions, cancer, diabetes, coronary heart disease and provide new leads of therapeutic targets to those diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell culture and RNA isolation</title><p>Human Lung Microvascular Endothelial Cells (HMVEC, Lonza catalog # CC-2815) were cultured as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0031229-Ye1">[31]</xref>.

TopHat's default settings were used: 40 alignments per read were allowed, with up to 2 mismatches per alignment.

To determine differential expression of known isoforms between the treatment and control groups, Cuffdiff analyses were performed using the reference genome comparing the thrombin treatment samples to the control samples. The biologic replicates were pooled for those analyses. To detect novel isoforms, Cufflinks was run without a reference genome. This method allows the construction of the minimum number of transcripts that described the data without a bias towards already discovered transcripts. The sample transcript files were then compared to the reference genome using Cuffcompare, effectively filtering out those already-discovered transcripts. To test the differential expression of these novel isoforms, Cuffdiff analyses were performed using the combined transcript files as the reference genome.
