Here, we present a new method for local lysis of live adherent cells for nucleic acid analyses. This method addresses bottlenecks in current approaches, such as dilution of analytes, one-sample-one-test, and incompatibility to adherent cells. We make use of a scanning probe technology - a microfluidic probe - and implement hierarchical hydrodynamic flow confinement (hHFC) to localize multiple biochemicals on a biological substrate in a non-contact, non-destructive manner. hHFC enables rapid recovery of nucleic acids by coupling cell lysis and lysate collection. We locally lysed ~300 cells with chemical systems adapted for DNA or RNA and obtained lysates of ~70 cells/&#x003bc;L for DNA analysis and ~15 cells/&#x003bc;L for mRNA analysis. The lysates were introduced into PCR-based workflows for genomic and transcriptomic analysis. This strategy further enabled selective local lysis of subpopulations in a co-culture of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, validated by characteristic E-cadherin gene expression in individually extracted cell types. The developed strategy can be applied to study cell-cell, cell-matrix interactions locally, with implications in understanding growth, progression and drug response of a tumor.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Most biological processes are consequences of cells interacting with their microenvironment to perform healthy tissue-level functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. This microenvironment can be the surrounding extracellular matrix or the different cell types constituting the tissue. Cellular interactions predominantly comprise direct physical contact<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, migration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> and multimodal signal transduction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Understanding and elaborating the effects of such interactions requires studying cells in their varying microenvironments. Spatially-resolved probing of cells in their native microenvironment in biological substrates, such as complex co-cultures or heterogeneous tissue sections, are therefore fundamental to understanding cell communication, signaling and growth.</p><p>Cell-cell interactions are classified as homotypic and heterotypic. Traditionally, homotypic interactions are studied by culturing cells with a stimuli of interest (e.g., matrix type, soluble factors) and performing genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic studies of the entire clonal population. Heterotypic interactions can be studied by means of co-culturing different cell types in physical or biochemical contact using a range of culture methods<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. These heterogeneous culture formats are more representative of native tissue biology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> than monocultures. There is therefore a need to develop strategies that allow selective sampling and analysis of multiple cells in culture <italic>in situ</italic>. Ideally, such a strategy should be local, non-invasive, aqueous-based, flexible and interactive.</p><p>A few technologies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> have demonstrated several of these positive traits for local sampling of cells, but do not have all the necessary attributes to perform spatially-resolved probing of cells. These technologies either present the biological substrate to the device<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> or present the device to the biological substrate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. The former category includes flow cytometric methods and lab-on-a-chip platforms that flow and analyze cells in channels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Limitations of such biological substrate-to-device approaches include difficulties in handling native biological substrates, complex culture conditions, and long assay times owing to diffusion-based transport of the signaling molecules being investigated. The device-to-substrate category includes devices that selectively scan and process native biological substrates, such as microfabricated hollow cantilevers &#x02013; FluidFM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, and platforms that use laser-based ablation for laser capture microdissection (LCM) for example<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. The Fluid-FM does not confine chemicals on a substrate and can either inject or aspirate a given chemical, decoupling treatment and sampling. The LCM-based sampling method for adherent cells requires culture on specialized substrates and requires specialized training. One other approach that localizes liquid on a substrate is the chemistrode<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, which confines the processing chemical using a multiphase system, albeit with direct physical contact between the probe and the substrate.</p><p>The MFP technology relies on microfabricated heads and platforms for localizing liquids on biological surfaces using hydrodynamic flows and enables handling, analyzing, and interacting with native biological samples<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Liquid localization is implemented by simultaneous injection and aspiration of a processing liquid; a principle termed hydrodynamic flow confinement (HFC). The locally-confined processing liquid interacts with the biological substrate without the probe physically contacting the substrate, making this approach non-destructive to the surrounding sample. Local confinement of the liquid over the biological substrate increases the number of spatially resolved investigations that can be performed on the same sample. The spatial resolution is dictated by the microchannel dimensions and the microfluidic technique that defines the shape of the confined liquid<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Control over spatial resolution enables the MFP to probe substrate properties at varying levels of complexity, for example, probing single cells or hundreds of cells simultaneously for their molecular characteristics. In addition, real-time visual feedback of the substrate processing allows the user to adapt operating conditions during MFP operation, e.g., the probe-to-surface distance, coordinates of the probe on the substrate, and flow rates. This provides the user a high degree of control and flexibility while operating on delicate biological substrates. The MFP and its variants have been used for patterning protein microarrays and complex chemical gradients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, patterning DNA on surfaces<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, micro-immunohistochemistry of tissue sections<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, local perfusion of brain slices<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, single cell pharmacology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, probing enzyme activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, and studying cell interactions in monocultures for mRNA analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.</p><p>In this paper, we exploit a particular variant of the MFP, the vertically-oriented MFP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, to perform selective spatial sampling of cells from adherent cultures. With the MFP, we implement hHFC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, in which we simultaneously confine multiple liquids on a substrate. We locally and rapidly lyse cells using the inner confinement of the hHFC, while shielding the sampled lysate from the surrounding sample using an outer shaping confinement. This approach of selective sampling using the hHFC is strategic for concentrated lysates free of contaminants and a rapid overall workflow for nucleic acid analysis. Specifically, we use the lysates to study DNA and mRNA of targeted cell subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). A spatially-resolved genome provides the mutational signature of the cells being studied (spontaneous somatic and clonal mutations for example). A spatially-resolved transcriptome represents the immediate response of selected cells to physical or biochemical stimulus. Methods to interrogate the local transcriptome of a cell culture surface after differential exposure to signals, biochemical or physical, would facilitate a deeper understanding interactions between cells and their microenvironment. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first demonstration of spatially-resolved sampling from live co-cultures for analysis of DNA and mRNA.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><p>The quality of nucleic acids is affected by the method used to extract them from cells. We identified four imperatives that need to be fulfilled to adapt standard extraction methods for use with the MFP. The method should (i) not denature the nucleic acid, (ii) not adversely affect the yield of the nucleic acid, (iii) be compatible with all steps in the analysis workflow, and (iv) allow selective lysis and sampling of cell sub-populations. To address the above requirements, we investigated interaction of hHFC with cells, chemical systems for local lysis and the downstream analysis of nucleic acids in the context of using the MFP for local lysis.</p><sec disp-level="2"><title>Operational parameterization and liquid handling for local lysis</title><p>In basic operation of the MFP, a processing liquid is injected through one aperture onto the substrate, and this liquid along with immersion liquid is aspirated via another aperture at a higher flow rate (e.g., <italic>Q</italic><sub>A</sub> (<italic>aspiration flow rate</italic>)&#x02009;=&#x02009;3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;<italic>Q</italic><sub>I</sub> (<italic>Injection flow rate</italic>)). Such a flow configuration results in the processing liquid being enveloped by the aspirated immersion liquid. Implementation of the HFC in this configuration for lysing and sampling purposes results in the dilution of the retrieved lysate in the aspirate. This dilution impedes action of the chemistry used for lysing the cells in the aspirate.</p><p>In contrast, the hHFC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>) uses two injection (I1 and I2) and two aspiration (A1 and A2) apertures to confine two liquids on the substrate. Therefore, the outer HFC nests and confines the processing liquid in the inner HFC. This nesting of liquid relaxes the requirement of a higher aspiration flow rate in the inner aspiration aperture (A1), allowing nearly equal injection and aspiration flow rates (i.e., <inline-formula id="d33e216"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e217" xlink:href="srep29579-m1.jpg"/></inline-formula>), therefore providing an optimal flow strategy for local sampling. In the context of such local sampling, the chemical components of the hHFC have multiple functions. The processing liquid injected from I2 is the component of the hHFC that performs cell lysis, whereas the shaping liquid injected from I1 shields the processing liquid from collecting cell and debris from beyond the hHFC. We note that the continuous flow of the processing liquid, which is inherent to the hHFC, enables simultaneous lysis and sample collection.</p><p>Local cell lysis depends on multiple parameters, for example, the time spent by the processing liquid in contact with cells, the chemical system (see next paragraph) and flow velocities (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3</xref>). These parameters are coupled and here we discuss their contribution in the context of local lysis. We define the time spent by the processing liquid interacting with the adherent cells causing complete cell lysis as the residence time (<italic>T</italic><sub>R</sub>). <italic>T</italic><sub>R</sub> strongly depends on the choice of the lysing chemicals, for example, trypsin often used to detach adherent cells from culture is a weak lysing agent, and would lead to higher <italic>T</italic><sub>R</sub>. As expected, <italic>T</italic><sub>R</sub> also depends on flow velocities - a lower flow velocity results in lower shear on the cell surface, therefore a higher <italic>T</italic><sub>R</sub>. However, in the context of the lysate concentration, the higher the <italic>T</italic><sub>R</sub>, the larger is the sample collection volume. This implies that a tradeoff is needed between the flow rates and the lysing chemicals to obtain concentrations of the nucleic acids that can be analyzed. We investigated these coupled parameters using MCF7 cells monolayers as a model system to establish operational parameters.</p><p>To obtain DNA that can be used for quantitative analysis using qPCR, we adapted the heat-induced alkaline retrieval method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. This method uses sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to simultaneously extract and lyse cultured cells. NaOH facilitates lysis by locally changing the pH on the cells, thus facilitating denaturation of cellular components. However, denaturation of proteins using NaOH leads to a slurry, which can cause perturbations in the hHFC. We therefore choose the flow rates such that the lysate is primed with a small volume of extraction buffer containing Proteinase K (provided by channel I1), resulting in digestion of the slurry in the lysate. The flow rules for obtaining the chemical configuration described are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>.</p><p>NaOH concentration required for rapid lysis was determined by first establishing the range of concentrations compatible with quantitative PCR (qPCR). A concentration of 50&#x02009;mM or less of NaOH when used for digesting 1000 cells led to DNA quantities post amplification similar to pure DNA in solution isolated from 1000 cells using standard protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). This suggests that even though higher concentrations (&#x0003e;50&#x02009;mM) of NaOH might result in more effective lysis, the resulting ion concentrations are incompatible with qPCR.</p><p>We chose the flow rates considering tradeoffs between the flow velocity on the cell monolayer (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3</xref>), the dilution, <italic>T</italic><sub>R</sub>, and practicality of operating the hHFC for sampling. The flow confinement is minimally perturbed when the aspiration rates in each aspiration aperture are between 3 and 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;L/min. A NaOH injection flow rate (<italic>Q</italic><sub>I2</sub>) of 6&#x02009;&#x003bc;L/min was considered suitable for continuous operation as higher flow rates provided only an incremental improvement in <italic>T</italic><sub>R</sub> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3</xref>).</p><p>We term the region of the adherent cells that interacts with the processing liquid as the footprint of the HFC. The T<sub>R</sub> needed for lysis of a single footprint can be used to characterize the interaction of different NaOH concentrations with cells. To establish this T<sub>R</sub>, we injected processing liquid with 10, 25 and 50&#x02009;mM NaOH to lyse MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). During lysis, we scanned the probe over the monolayer at exponentially increasing velocities from 1 &#x003bc;m/s to 1000&#x02009;&#x003bc;m/s. The scanning velocity inversely correlates with T<sub>R</sub>. An exponential velocity profile allowed the use of a range of velocities over short distances to establish the T<sub>R</sub> for complete local lysis. The effective scanning velocity (v<sub>eff</sub>) is the highest scanning velocity at which lysis occurs reproducibly and can be calculated using the length of the lane that is clear of cells.</p><p>We obtained suitable local lysis of cells using 50&#x02009;mM NaOH as the processing liquid, for which T<sub>R</sub> and v<sub>eff</sub> were 16.9&#x02009;s and 70&#x02009;&#x003bc;m/s, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). Subsequently, we used T<sub>R</sub> of 20&#x02009;s to address sample-to-sample variations. For this T<sub>R</sub>, the lysate volume aspirated in channel A1 for a single footprint is 2.3&#x02009;&#x003bc;L (i.e., V&#x02009;=&#x02009;Q<sub>A2</sub>&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;T<sub>R</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7&#x02009;&#x003bc;L/min&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;20&#x02009;s). This 2.3&#x02009;&#x003bc;L lysate can be used as sample for PCR-based DNA quantification. Collecting the lysate in such small volumes ensures a high concentration of DNA. The use of DNA isolation methods (for example, for column-based purification) would significantly affect the DNA recovery yield. We therefore circumvent the need for DNA isolation methods by performing crude boiling of the high-pH lysate and use of the neutralized lysate as sample for the qPCR. This ensures that low concentration artefacts are avoided during analysis because the concentration of retrieved DNA is orders of magnitude higher than the sensitivity of the PCR method.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Versatility in sampling volumes and sampling formats</title><p>We developed different sample-retrieval strategies to handle a range of sample volumes. For small volumes (&#x0003c;25&#x02009;&#x003bc;L), we flush the collected lysate onto a Parafilm M&#x000ae; mounted on a solid support or into the cap of a PCR tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). For intermediate volumes (25&#x02013;100&#x02009;&#x003bc;L), we use a HPLC injection valve and a sampling loop to aspirate through during sampling and bypass while not sampling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). For large volumes (&#x0003e;100&#x02009;&#x003bc;L), the sample is directly flushed into a PCR tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). With qPCR, we use sample volumes of less than 10 &#x003bc;L; therefore we use the small-volume <italic>in-situ</italic> recovery and collect the lysate in the cap of a PCR tube. We combine local lysis with the scanning capability of the MFP to effect lysis in both array and lane formats with control over the cell quantities sampled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Quantitation of DNA in local lysate</title><p>We sampled multiple footprints (5, 10 and 15), with ~400 cells in each footprint from an MCF7 confluent cell layer and analyzed the DNA quantity in the lysate using qPCR for the <italic>&#x003b2;-actin</italic> gene.

The parameter varied in these extractions is the <italic>T</italic><sub>R</sub> per footprint and corresponds to 40, 20 and 13&#x02009;s for 5, 10 and 15 footprints, respectively. Experimental control sample was collected by processing an area on the monolayer already lysed between each multiple-footprint sampling. Controls showed negligible DNA quantities in all experiments.</p><p>Each multiple-footprint (5, 10 or 15) sampling was supplemented with a single-footprint extract (<italic>T</italic><sub>R</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;200 s) on a given monolayer for normalization. The effective number of footprints for the multiple-footprint extracts was calculated as a multiple of the single-footprint extract, using their respective absolute DNA quantities (mass). DNA quantities increased, as expected, between 1, 5 and 10 footprints, but dropped for 15 footprints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). The quantity was lower for 15 footprints owing to incomplete lysis of cells within each footprint because of suboptimal <italic>T</italic><sub>R</sub>.</p><p>The quantity of DNA obtained from 10 footprint extracts was comparable to the expected quantity (10&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;DNA from 1 footprint), which corroborates <italic>T</italic><sub>R</sub> of 20&#x02009;s. We manually counted cells in 10 footprints prior to local lysis and obtained 369&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;18 cells in each footprint. qPCR quantification of these 10 footprints led to a DNA equivalent of 307&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;54 cells/footprint and a 83.2% DNA recovery yield.</p><p>The quality and quantity of DNA obtained suggests that (i) the collected lysate contains only the sampled footprints evidenced by the varying quantities of DNA obtained in a fixed volume, (ii) the DNA collected can be amplified and quantified, and (iii) the sampled quantity can be varied based on the requirements of the downstream process.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Spatially resolved probing of gene expression in adherents co-cultures</title><p>Local cell lysis for mRNA extraction requires an adaption of the chemical system compared with the chemical system used for DNA because high pH affects the quality of mRNA. Here we used the extraction buffer containing a combination of detergent (Tween&#x000ae; 20), a chelating agent (EDTA), and a broad spectrum protease (proteinase K). This allows dissolution of the cell membrane, protein digestion, and detachment of the exposed cells, but keeps the nucleic acids intact.</p><p>To validate local and selective lysis using this chemical system and the quality of the isolated mRNA, we demonstrate lysis of individual cell types in a co-culture of cells with variant expression of a gene.

Molecular biology assays for performing such local multimodal genomic and transcriptomic analyses usually require high concentrations of nucleic acids for artefact-free analysis. This is challenging for local sampling strategies as they inherently contain only a small quantity of nucleic acids. The MFP and the hHFC in conjunction with the chemical system described in this work address this challenge, while providing significant improvements in processing times and local analysis of nucleic acids. The HFC overcomes diffusion limitations that are characteristic of most molecular biology assays performed on bench-top platforms by means of convectively replenishing the liquid processing the surface. In addition, through minimal dilution of the processing liquid, the hHFC enables continuous lysing action on the cells on the substrate and in the aspiration channel, which results in highly concentrated lysates.</p><p>The choice of processing liquid has been adapted for each of the nucleic acids to optimize the lysis for downstream analysis. We use NaOH when DNA is the analyte of interest and Proteinase-K-based extraction buffer when mRNA is the analyte of interest. The residence time is the parameter that characterizes the extraction method, as it depends on the chemistry and the flow rates and determines lysate concentration and volume as a consequence. Potential approaches to modulate and tune <italic>T</italic><sub>R</sub> based on the required application include recirculation of the chemical system between the inner apertures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> during sampling operation, use of alternate chemistries for shorter <italic>T</italic><sub>R</sub>, modification of the channel geometries, and increase in temperature of operation. <italic>T</italic><sub>R</sub> is independent of the size of the area of interest on the cell surface. This attribute to modulate <italic>T</italic><sub>R</sub> enables rapid sampling of adherent cells at varying levels of spatial resolution.</p><p>Generally, molecular analysis of adherent cells is performed on several different scales, from 3D spheroidal cultures containing hundreds of cells to a single cell, depending on the objective of the investigation. Here, we sample ~400 cells to avoid method-based and statistical artefacts in genomic and transcriptomic studies. With this level of spatial resolution, we were able to obtain quantities of DNA that are sufficient for DNA-sequencing studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. With respect to mRNA analysis of selectively lysed cells in co-culture, we were able to obtain expected gene expression profiles for the isolated cell types. Because rtPCR was used for the analysis, the quality of the mRNA is compatible with RNAseq studies with appropriate scaling of the spatial resolution. Purified DNA and mRNA can be used for non-PCR based analytical methods such as MALDI-TOF, for improving the molecular resolution of the obtained profiles. The chemical and fluidic configuration presented in this paper may be suitable for probing gene-expression profiles in 3D cultures, as evidenced by the effective local lysis of multilayered cells that were obtained in some cases by over-culture. For the particular case of studying a single cell in its microenvironment, we might be able to scale down the spatial resolution. For example, in our earlier work<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, we fabricated apertures as small as 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;m&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;1&#x02009;&#x003bc;m, however with such aperture dimensions we cannot exclude rapid clogging of channels during regular operation. Another approach includes modulating the shaping liquid to have a small fraction of the processing liquid make contact with a surface, as detailed by Autebert <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p><p>In addition to the probing of local genomes and transcriptomes of cells in culture at the end-point of a given study, we can perform temporal studies as MFP is non-destructive to the un-sampled regions on the cell layer. By allowing chronological investigations on effects of various stimuli, this provides an additional dimension to the information obtained from adherent cell experiments. Furthermore, most molecular biology protocols perform multi-step chemistry on biological substrates. With the hHFC, we can perform such multi-step chemistry by injecting liquids sequentially and furthermore process a surface with different chemicals simultaneously. The laminar flow profiles of the liquids injected on the substrate ensure distinct aspiration of the injected liquids. We developed and chose chemical systems to be compatible with such distinct, but simultaneous sampling. We used the components of the shielding liquid (extraction buffer with proteinase K) in the local DNA analysis experiments as the processing liquid in the local mRNA analysis. Therefore, the developed strategy has the advantage of sampling the inner and the outer HFCs for DNA and RNA analysis simultaneously.</p><p>The chemistry used for local lysis causes disintegration of the exposed cell by solubilizing the membrane and the intracellular machinery. Therefore, the strategy developed can be broadly used to study DNA and RNA, not only in fixed population of cells, but also applied to clinical samples so as to obtain spatially-resolved mutation profiles of heterogeneous tissues for diagnostic applications.</p><sec disp-level="2"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>We demonstrated a new strategy for spatially-resolved and selective lysis of cells from adherent mono- and co-culture substrates for local DNA and mRNA analysis. This method can further be applied to perform temporally and spatially resolved probing of gene expression in adherent cultures, thus improving our understanding of multicellular interactions significantly. The quality and quantity of the nucleic acids obtained using this strategy enable multiple downstream analyses, exemplified by qPCR and rtPCR in this paper, and eventually next-generation sequencing (DNAseq and RNAseq). Combining next-generation sequencing with the local sampling strategy described here can provide a complete molecular profile of cells interacting with their native microenvironment, with these profiles resolved potentially even to the level of a single molecule.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>MFP platform, head and handling</title><p>The MFP platform included motorized scanning stages, peripherals for liquid handling and a microfabricated head.

Briefly, the head and its channels were designed using L-edit (Tanner EDA), and the channel pattern was written on a chromium mask using a laser writer (WL 2000, Heidelberg Instruments Mikrotechnik GmbH). A 400-&#x003bc;m-thick Si layer was etched to 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;m depth with the masked pattern using deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) and then anodically bonded to a 500-&#x003bc;m-thick glass wafer, resulting in micron-sized, 100-&#x003bc;m-deep channels. The channels were filled with wax through the vias, and the patterned silicon/glass wafers were diced to form individual heads. The heads were polished, dewaxed, and cleaned prior to use. The heads used for the experiments in this paper had channels of the dimension 200&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;100&#x02009;&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup> (forming the outer apertures), 100&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;100&#x02009;&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup> (forming the inner apertures), and 500&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;100&#x02009;&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup> (forming the immersion channels) with 100-&#x003bc;m spacing between apertures (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>During operation, the vias in the head were connected to liquid-handling peripherals, which included pumps (Nemesys, Cetoni GmbH, Korbussen, DE), syringes (Hamilton 1705 TLLX, Bonaduz, CH), and associated tubing and connectors (Upchurch Scientific, IDEX Health &#x00026; Science LLC, Oak Harbor, WA, USA) providing the required fluid flow.
