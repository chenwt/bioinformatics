Although epithelial cell differentiation has been studied in great detail and the role of Wnt signaling in this process is well described, the contribution of epidermal Wnt secretion in epithelial cell homeostasis remains poorly understood. To analyze the role of Wnt proteins in this process, we created a conditional knockout allele of the Wnt cargo receptor Evi/Gpr177/Wntless and studied mice that lacked Evi expression in the epidermis. We found that K14-Cre, Evi-LOF mice lost their hair during the first hair cycle, showing a reddish skin with impaired skin barrier function. Expression profiling of mutant and wild-type skin revealed up-regulation of inflammation-associated genes. Furthermore, we found that Evi expression in psoriatic skin biopsies is down-regulated, suggesting that Evi-deficient mice developed skin lesions that resemble human psoriasis. Immune cell infiltration was detected in Evi-LOF skin.

Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis are the two main chronic conditions of inflammatory skin diseases and originate from an aberrant interaction between the skin and the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pittelkow, 2005</xref>). Characteristics of inflamed scaly skin are hyperproliferation and altered differentiation of keratinocytes, as well as increased inflammatory cell infiltration and blood vessel formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lowes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wagner et al., 2010</xref>). Beyond environmental factors, a large set of hereditary factors, including many genes related to the immune system, contribute to the onset of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nestle et al., 2009</xref>). Some alterations in genes related to proper skin barrier function like filaggrin have also been implicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Proksch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roberson and Bowcock, 2010</xref>). Deficiencies in physical, biochemical, or immunological compositions enable percutaneous penetration of chemicals and microbes, which promotes inflammation. In mice, transgenic studies addressed the contribution of key signaling pathways to model psoriatic skin, including STAT3, AP-1, TGF-&#x003b2;, NF-&#x003ba;B, and VEGF pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gudjonsson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Swindell et al., 2011</xref>). These genetic studies have yielded insights into the regulation of complex inflammatory circuits, contributed to unraveling molecular and cellular changes that are consistently detected in psoriatic plaques, and contributed to developing novel therapeutic strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wagner et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The contribution of Wnt signaling to the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory skin diseases has not been studied in great detail. A genetic link between pathological skin malformations and components of the Wnt signaling pathway was reported for the Goltz-Gorlin syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grzeschik et al., 2007</xref>). The Goltz-Gorlin Syndrome is an X-linked dominant disorder caused by mutations in the <italic>PORCN</italic> gene, which encodes for the acyl-transferase Porcupine, a component of the Wnt signaling pathway. Porcupine is required for the palmitoylation of Wnt proteins in the ER, a necessary step in Wnt secretion. <italic>PORCN</italic> mutations cause hypoplastic, hyperpigmented skin as well as digital, ocular, and dental malformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lombardi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, two recent studies reported an up-regulation of Wnt5A and differential expression of other Wnt pathway components in human psoriatic plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gudjonsson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reischl et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Romanowska et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Wnt proteins are lipid modified in the Wnt-producing cell and require the cargo receptor Evi/Wls for exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">B&#x000e4;nziger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bartscherer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goodman et al., 2006</xref>). They trigger distinct intracellular cascades divided mainly in &#x003b2;-catenin&#x02013;dependent/canonical and &#x003b2;-catenin&#x02013;independent/noncanonical signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</xref>). Canonical Wnt signals play fundamental roles during hair follicle development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huelsken and Birchmeier, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso and Fuchs, 2003</xref>). Beyond controlling the initiation of epidermal appendage formation, Wnt signaling contributes to the spatial hair follicle distribution and orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schlake and Sick, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The present study aimed at analyzing the role of Evi-regulated Wnt secretion in the epidermis. To this end, we conditionally deleted the <italic>Evi</italic> gene in squamous epithelial cells in mice. An abrogation of <italic>Evi</italic> function resulted in inflamed skin with hyperplasia, impaired barrier function, and differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes as well as vascular hyperplasia. We observed significant dermal infiltration of innate immune cells and T cell recruitment. Interestingly, a significant reduction in dendritic epidermal T cells (DETCs) with high levels of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cell receptor was identified in Evi mutant skin. The depletion of DETC started postnatally, suggesting that Wnt-secreting keratinocytes play important roles in DETC survival in the murine skin. Moreover, a second &#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>low</sup> T cell population invaded Evi-LOF epidermis, suggesting that modulation of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cell populations contributed to the observed immune cell dysregulation. In addition, Evi-deficient keratinocytes showed increased activation of STAT3. Collectively, the deletion of <italic>Evi</italic> in keratinocytes created a skin profile resembling chronic cutaneous inflammatory diseases. The data indicates that aberrant control of Wnt secretion leads to severe aberrations during skin homeostasis. We observed that reduced expression of Evi in human psoriatic skin biopsies strengthens the relevance of Wnt signaling in human psoriasis. Therefore, Evi-deficient mice may represent a novel model to study psoriasiform dermatitis&#x02013;related diseases.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Epidermal deletion of Evi leads to growth retardation, early lethality, and irritated skin</title><p>To investigate the role of Wnt secretion during organ development, we generated Evi<sup>floxed/floxed</sup> mice by homologous recombination deleting exon 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A&#x02013;C</xref>). Global deletion of Evi expression using a pan-deleter (Evi<sup>fl/fl</sup>, Cre-deleter) led to mid-gestational embryonic lethality phenocopying Wnt3a-deficient mice, as also reported previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fu et al., 2009</xref>). Conditional epidermal deletion of Evi was next performed by crossing Evi<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice with K14-Cre mice, which spatially directs Evi deletion into squamous epithelial cells. Expression of the K14 promoter starts during embryonic development (embryonic day 12 [E12]) and remains high in haired as well as hairless skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huelsken and Birchmeier, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huelsken et al., 2001</xref>). K14-Cre is expressed in epithelial basal cells, as well as appendages of the skin, and has restricted expression in other epithelial structures like the thymus, esophagus, and forestomach. Evi<sup>fl/+</sup>, K14-Cre<sup>+</sup> mice appeared phenotypically normal. Evi<sup>fl/fl</sup>, K14-Cre<sup>+</sup> (Evi-LOF) mice were born at Mendelian frequency and after birth were indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates. As of postnatal day 6, Evi-LOF pups showed a &#x0201c;red nose&#x0201d; phenotype and retained visibly less dense fur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). In addition, Evi-LOF animals showed a growth retardation phenotype and remained significantly smaller until they died within 10 wk (unpublished data).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Generation of floxed Evi mice and conditional depletion in squamous epithelium.</bold> (A) Targeting strategy for the conditional Evi allele with loxP sites flanking exon3.

Also, ears appeared increasingly malformed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>), suggesting that epidermal Wnt secretion also affects underlying cartilage formation. In addition, the skin became irritated, flaky, and thin with exposed blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>), and the eyes of Evi-LOF appeared swollen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 I</xref>). Based on these visible skin alterations, we performed an extensive histological comparison of wild-type and mutant skin. First, we validated the deletion of epidermal Evi expression by immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 J</xref>). Control skin keratinocytes prominently expressed Evi in an irregular pattern. Similarly smooth muscle cells of underlying blood vessels were stained positively; whereas Evi protein was weakly detectable in dermal fibroblast, Evi protein was not detectable in Evi-LOF epidermis, confirming its successful depletion.</p><p>Hematoxylin &#x00026; eosin (H&#x00026;E)&#x02013;stained sections of Evi-LOF skin revealed dramatic changes in skin structures, which became increasingly severe during the first hair cycle of the skin. Fewer hair follicles developed in Evi-LOF skin, which degenerated to cyst-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Pronounced scale formation was visible on the skin of young pups and persisted throughout the lifetime, indicating impaired keratinocyte differentiation. The epidermis of mutant skin appeared hyperproliferative in contrast to a thin dermis and hypodermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). In normal skin, proliferating cells were detectable in the basal layer of the epidermis and in hair follicle bulbs. The distribution of phospho-H3&#x02013;positive cells in the skin of Evi-LOF mice showed an increased proportion of proliferating basal cells in Evi-LOF, whereas the number of proliferating cells in the bulb was decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). This data indicates that Evi-LOF epidermis was renewed by rapidly dividing cells in the basal layer and not by proliferating bulge stem cells. Collectively, Evi-LOF skin was displayed by impaired hair follicle formation, dermal degeneration, and enhanced keratinocyte proliferation.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Hyperproliferation of basal cells in Evi-LOF epidermis.</bold> (A) H&#x00026;E-stained sections of Evi-LOF and control skin at different ages.

Results are combined from two independent experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JEM_20121871_Fig2"/></fig><p>To determine whether other changes in epithelial structures were present in Evi-LOF animals, we probed for the expression of epidermal differentiation markers such as loricrin, Keratin-5 (K5), K8, K14, and K16. Loricrin was expressed in the outer layer of keratinocytes in Evi-LOF mice but not as consistently as in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). K5-, K8-, and K14-, as well as basal layer&#x02013; and hair follicle&#x02013;expressed marker were similarly distributed in the follicles of wild-type and Evi-LOF mice, whereas they were expressed in several layers of the hyperproliferative epidermis in Evi-LOF mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Interestingly, K16 was enriched in Evi-LOF suprabasal keratinocytes compared with wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). K16 is a marker for differentiated keratinocytes, which is strongly induced during wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leigh et al., 1995</xref>). Besides providing mechanical integrity, networks of keratin filaments are also involved in cellular functions like apoptosis and stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chamcheu et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether additional structural components were differentially regulated and performed expression analysis by RNA-seq of epidermal sheets. We found that a total of 1,298 transcripts were differentially expressed in Evi-LOF epidermis of P21 mice compared with control littermates. Analyses of differing genes revealed the following changes in a set of keratins: K1, K6a, K7, K16, K17, K24, K42, and K79 were found to be up-regulated, whereas the expression of K2, K15, K32, and K77 was down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Both, K6 and K16 are involved in wound regeneration, providing strength and resiliency to the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leigh et al., 1995</xref>). K1 is involved in hyperkeratosis and contributes to stratum corneum thickening. K17 promotes keratinocyte proliferation and tumor growth by enforcing the immune response in the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Depianto et al., 2010</xref>). Mutation in the spinous layer keratin K2 has been associated with bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama et al., 2005</xref>). K15 expression is down-regulated in hyperproliferative skin, contributing to psoriasis and hypertrophic scars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Waseem et al., 1999</xref>). K77 and K32 are involved in hair fiber formation. In summary, the analysis of keratin expression indicates that loss of epidermal Wnt secretion led to differentially regulated expression of several keratin proteins, which are involved in skin regeneration and inflammation.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Impaired keratin expression in Evi-LOF indicates ongoing inflammation.</bold> (A) Immunohistochemistry against &#x003b2;-catenin and keratinocyte differentiation marker (loricrin, K5, K8, K16, and K14).

Most prominently, the chemokines Cxcl1, Ccl2, Ccl6, Ccl20, and Ccl22 were up-regulated, Cxcl14 and Cc127a were down-regulated, and expression of the some IL1 family members and IL17f were increased, whereas IL15, IL6f, and IL34 were decreased. Several IL1 family members are involved in cutaneous inflammation. The related IL1 ligands IL1f5, IL1f6, IL1f8, and IL1f9, which were up-regulated in Evi-LOF skin, are linked to cutaneous alterations similar to psoriasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blumberg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Onoufriadis et al., 2011</xref>). The cytokines IL1f6, IL1f8, and IL1f9 activate pathways leading to NF-&#x003ba;B and MAPK signaling, suggesting a cross talk of these pathways and Wnt signaling in the skin. In summary, this cytokine signature contained genes involved in lymphocyte recruitment (Cxc family members, Ccl family members, and IL17), activation (IL1), proliferation, and survival (IL6, IL7, and IL15) and shows that epidermal loss of Evi correlated with activated immune and inflammatory response.</p><p>Inflammation has emerged as a driver of angiogenesis. For this reason, we analyzed the vessel density in the dermis of Evi-LOF skin and wild-type littermates. Quantification of H&#x00026;E-stained sections of Evi-LOF revealed significantly more blood filled vessels compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, D and E</xref>). Similar results were obtained with CD31-labeled skin sections (unpublished data), indicating that depletion of Wnt secretion in the epidermis triggered an angiogenic response in Evi-LOF skin.</p><p>Ultrastructural analyses revealed multilayering of the epidermis in Evi-LOF skin compared with single-layered wild-type epidermis. In addition, spongiosis was observed in Evi-LOF as a sign of ongoing inflammation and impaired fluid homeostasis, whereas the dermis was thin but otherwise without pathological findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>).</p><p>The main important function of the skin is to build an effective barrier preventing biological, chemical, and physical invasion from the outside, as well as retaining solutes from the inside and maintaining thermoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Proksch et al., 2008</xref>). Proper epidermal stratification is crucial for the development and homeostasis of epidermal barrier function. Impaired skin permeability function often correlates with inflamed tissue. Therefore, we performed dye-penetration assay with Luciferin yellow and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) analysis to analyze barrier function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>). Both assays revealed a significant alteration in skin barrier function. Neonatal mice showed no skin barrier alterations, whereas older pups (&#x0003e;postnatal day 6 [P6]) developed barrier defects, which lead to dye penetration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Similarly, TEWL analysis revealed dramatic water loss in adult Evi-LOF mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that the mutant mice embryos formed mature epidermis. However, progressive depletion of Evi function in the epidermis of the pups altered skin penetration. Furthermore, the onset of the barrier alterations was in parallel to first signs of inflammation (red nose phenotype, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). The data indicates that barrier disruption is time-linked to the onset of skin inflammation and starts rather early in the disease development of Evi-LOF mice. Measurements of surface body temperature of age-matched mice revealed reduced temperature of adult Evi-LOF mice, indicating impaired thermoregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). The mutant mice also showed a lack of fat tissue sustainment, which suggested that the mice might have balanced the lack of thermoregulation with a hypermetabolic response. Lack of fluid retention, thermoregulation, and sustainment of fat tissue cause stress to the mutant mice and might result in growth retardation and early lethality. In addition expression analysis of epidermal sheets revealed pronounced changes in the transcription of EDC (epidermal differentiation complex) genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Guzman Strong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>). Particularly, most LCE (10 out of 16 genes) and SRPP (12 out of 15 genes) family members are differentially regulated, supporting altered cornification and barrier function in Evi mutant mice.

Both genes are involved in neutrophil mobilization and likely contribute to the enhanced neutrophil invasion in Evi-LOF skin. We also examined the infiltration of other innate immune cells like macrophages (CD68) and mast cells (Toluidine) in Evi-LOF skin and controls.

Therefore, we asked whether Evi-LOF skin inflammation correlated with &#x003b2;-catenin or &#x003b2;-catenin&#x02013;independent Wnt signaling. &#x003b2;-catenin<sup>fl/fl</sup> &#x000d7; K14 mutant mice (&#x003b2;-cat-LOF) mice were viable. Hair follicle formation was impaired in mutants, and &#x003b2;-cat-LOF mice lost their hair during the first hair cycle, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huelsken et al., 2001</xref>), and showed a hyperproliferative epidermis; however, they have not been analyzed for an inflammatory phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huelsken et al., 2001</xref>). Histological quantification of neutrophil recruitment and quantification of S100A9 mRNA expression revealed enhanced infiltration of neutrophils, although to a lesser extent than in Evi-LOF mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, E and F</xref>). These data indicate that canonical Wnt signaling in keratinocytes contributes to skin homeostasis and inflammation. The phenotype of Evi-LOF mutant additionally revealed a reduction of dermal fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2012</xref>), which might lead to a more severe inflammatory phenotype compared with &#x003b2;-cat-LOF.</p><p>Next, we asked whether neutrophil recruitment was also affected in Evi gain-of-function animals, assuming that Evi-GOF should result in the opposite effect than Evi-LOF. We previously generated ROSA26:Evi-YFP (Evi-GOF) knockin mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Augustin et al., 2012</xref>) and showed that overexpression of Evi-YFP increased Wnt reporter activity in embryonic stem cell culture. These experiments suggested that the overexpressed Evi protein was functional and secreted Wnt proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Augustin et al., 2012</xref>). Evi-GOF mice were viable, fertile, and showed no major phenotypic alterations. Overall skin architecture of Evi-GOF mice was comparable to control skin, indicating that ectopic Evi expression could be tolerated without major pathophysiological consequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 G</xref>). These findings suggested that additional parameters were necessary to overactivate Wnt signaling in vivo. Specific immunofluorescence analysis of YFP revealed pronounced labeling of keratinocytes, confirming that Evi-YFP protein was ectopically expressed in the skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 H</xref>). We consequently asked if Evi-GOF showed an effect in a 12-<italic>O</italic>-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) assay of acute regenerative inflammation. TPA induces strong up-regulation of proinflammatory signaling molecules and leads to dermal infiltration by immune cells and epidermal hyperplasia. Neutrophils represent the first immune cells recruited after inflammatory induction. We analyzed the dermal infiltration of neutrophils in Evi-GOF and wild-type controls over time. Skin specimens were collected 6, 24, and 48 h after TPA application. Strong infiltration of neutrophils was observed after 6 and 24 h of treatment, whereas the infiltration disappeared after 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, I and J</xref>). However, neutrophil infiltration was significantly less in Evi-GOF skin. Acetone-treated Evi-GOF and wild-type mice showed no enhanced immune cell infiltration. The observed reduction of dermal neutrophil infiltration in Evi-GOF mice is consistent with the Evi-LOF phenotype, which was characterized by pronounced neutrophil recruitment. Both lines of experimental approaches support an important role of Evi in skin and immune cell cross talk and suggest a gatekeeper function of Evi in maintaining skin homeostasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Epidermal depletion of Evi leads to loss of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; TCR<sup>+</sup> T cells in the skin</title><p>Psoriatic skin lesions are usually infiltrated by cell of the innate, as well as adaptive, immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sabat et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nestle et al., 2009</xref>).

Therefore, we labeled proliferating cells with (29S)-29-Deoxy-29-fluoro-5-ethynyluridine (EdU) and quantified EdU-containing DETC by FACS. DETC isolated from epidermal, as well as dermal cell suspensions of mutant skin, revealed increased EdU incorporation, indicating enhanced cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>). In addition we analyzed the activation status of the DETC in Evi-LOF epidermal ear sheets and compared it to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>, the majority of the DETC in control ears form dendritic spines (&#x0003e;2) typical for resting DETC, and only 5% are activated. However, Evi mutants obtained &#x0223c;65% activated DETC and &#x0003c;5% resting DETC, indicating that DETC in Evi-LOF skin had sensitized epidermal stress, got activated, and started to proliferate. These results reflect the typical phenotype of stimulated DETC. Loss of DETC is therefore not a result of absence of DETC activation and proliferation but rather results from lack of sustainment signals. Similarly, &#x003b2;-catenin&#x02013;K14-LOF mice showed reduced DETC population, supporting a role of Wnt signaling in DETC maintenance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 D</xref>).</p><p>Next, we asked whether &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cell ligands are changed in Evi-LOF skin. Skint1 is expressed in epithelial cells of the thymus and the skin. It is involved in the selection of the DETC compartment in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boyden et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barbee et al., 2011</xref>). However, its function in the skin is still unclear. Skint1 was up-regulated in Evi-LOF epidermis (log<sub>2</sub> fold, 1.02; adj. p-value, 0.0001), suggesting that Skint1 expressed by keratinocytes might contribute to the &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cell distribution in mutant epidermis. Moreover, previous reports had shown that IL15 promotes &#x003b3;&#x003b4; TCR<sup>+</sup> T cell sustainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Edelbaum et al., 1995</xref>). Correspondingly, a significant reduction of IL15 expression was observed in Evi-LOF skin compared with wild-type control (log<sub>2</sub> fold, &#x02212;1.85 reduction; adj. p-value, 2.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>). This data indicates that Wnt signaling is involved in IL15 expression in the skin, which plays an essential role for DETC survival.</p><p>The K14 promoter is also expressed by thymic epithelial cells (TECs) of the inner medullar region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McLelland et al., 2011</xref>). We consequently asked if the restricted Evi depletion in TEC had an effect on the structure and T cell composition of the thymus. The relative weight of the thymus in Evi-LOF pups (P4) was similar compared with control mice. However, the weight of the thymus was significantly reduced in older mutant animals (P21 and P65), indicating that the thymi regressed due to enhanced atrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>). H&#x00026;E stainings of P4 and P28 thymic sections revealed no differences in the overall thymic architecture between Evi-LOF and wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>). Cortex and medulla structures were clearly separated with comparable sizes in younger mice. Thymi of older mice (P90) had discernible differences in thymic architecture leading to a reduction of medulla in mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>). Total thymus cellularity of P4 Evi-LOF thymi was unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 C</xref>). However, thymus cellularity in atrophic thymi of older mice (P40) was &#x0223c;50% reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 C</xref>). Analyses of cell surface markers demonstrated that the thymocyte set distribution (CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> double-negative [DN], CD4<sup>+</sup> single-positive, CD8<sup>+</sup> single-positive, and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> double-positive [DP] cells) of P4 Evi-LOF thymi were indistinguishable from control littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 D</xref>).

FoxN1-Cre mice are commonly used as a Cre driver for thymic epithelium. The Cre expression is directed to TEC precursors as well as to mature TEC. Moreover, the FoxN1 promoter is active in some epithelial cells of the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mecklenburg et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schlake, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gordon et al., 2007</xref>). FoxN1-Evi-LOF mice were viable and had slightly less dense hair than wild-type controls but showed no prominent signs of inflammation. DETCs were normally distributed and T cell infiltration was absent in mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 H</xref>). Consequently, Evi<sup>fl/fl</sup>, FoxN1-Cre mice did not develop inflamed skin, which supports the concept that epidermal Evi depletion, but not aberrant T cell development, triggered the inflammatory cascades.</p><p>Collectively, the data indicate that depletion of epidermal Wnt secretion leads to an inflammatory phenotype, which enforced T cell recruitment but inhibited survival of DETC. This phenotype did not correlate with severe thymic or thymocyte developmental defects. Rather, the dramatic reduction in thymic T cell development and loss of DP thymocytes in older Evi-LOF mice (P40) reflected characteristic changes after thymic atrophy in response to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Billard et al., 2011</xref>).

Consequently, consistent up-regulation of STAT3 signaling in keratinocytes contributes to skin diseases like psoriasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sano et al., 2005</xref>). IL17f reflects a proinflammatory cytokine up-regulated in Evi-LOF skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>) and is known to activate STAT3 signaling. A previous study also revealed that IL17a, which is highly homologous to IL17f, activates via STAT3 the expression of the psoriasis-associated K17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Swindell et al., 2011</xref>). To analyze whether STAT3 signaling is induced in Evi-LOF skin, we examined the levels of phosphorylated STAT3. Evi-LOF epidermal sections showed a prominent nuclear staining of activated STAT3 compared with control tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 A</xref>). Correspondingly, protein levels of phosphorylated STAT3 were significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 B</xref>). Analysis of RNA-seq expression data of epidermal sheets revealed several STAT3 signaling&#x02013;related genes, which were differentially expressed in Evi-LOF skin. Several cytokines (Ccl22, Ccl20, Cxcl1, Ccl2, IL1f5, and IL15) involved in immune cell mobilization were significantly changed in Evi-LOF epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 C</xref>). Histochemical stainings of K14&#x02013;&#x003b2;-catenin mice revealed enhanced nuclear STAT3 in K14&#x02013;&#x003b2;-catenin&#x02013;LOF skin, indicating that canonical Wnt signaling contributes to activation of STAT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 D</xref>).

Recent studies showed that ectodermal Wnt secretion is required for hair follicle initiation and proliferation of dermal fibroblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Myung et al., 2013</xref>). Ectopic expression of the secreted canonical Wnt signal inhibitor DKK1 in epidermal cells displayed developmental skin defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andl et al., 2002</xref>). K14-driven loss of <italic>Apc</italic> resulted in delayed and aberrant hair follicles morphogenesis as well as thymus degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuraguchi et al., 2006</xref>). However, no Wnt-related mouse model has so far addressed the effect of Wnt signaling in skin homeostasis with respect to inflammation. In the present study, the <italic>Evi</italic> gene was conditionally depleted in squamous epithelial cells. Abrogation of Evi function in these mice resulted in inflamed skin with hyperplasia, impaired differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes and barrier function, vascular hyperplasia, and infiltration of immune cells. Significant infiltration of leukocytes like neutrophils was observed. Neutrophils are effector cells of the innate immune response and play important roles during tissue damage in acute disease as well as chronic diseases. In psoriasis, prominent infiltration and microabscess formation by neutrophils is a characteristic feature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sch&#x000f6;n et al., 2000</xref>). Expression of chemoattractants together with the corresponding receptors by neutrophils is required to recruit neutrophils to the site of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sadik et al., 2011</xref>). The chemokine Cxcl1 and its receptor CxcR1 play important roles in neutrophil mobilization. Both genes were significantly up-regulated in Evi-LOF skin. In addition, Cxcl1 is a target gene of STAT3, which was also activated in Evi-LOF skin. These data support our previous findings of Evi function during glioma tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Augustin et al., 2012</xref>), which had indicated that STAT3 signaling functions downstream of Evi. Moreover, STAT3 has previously been shown to play a major role in skin wound healing and is also up-regulated in human psoriatic lesions. As such K5-STAT3 transgenic mice develop psoriasis-like phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sano et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The existence of impaired skin permeability function is widely accepted in inflammatory skin diseases like atopic dermatitis and psoriasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Proksch et al., 2008</xref>). Whether the barrier disruption is followed by inflammation or whether inflammation leads to permeability alterations is not clear. A definite conclusion about the initial contribution of altered skin barrier function or inflammation in our mouse model is also difficult because the defect appears to arise together with first signs of skin inflammation. However, skin barrier alteration in Evi-LOF mice precedes the onset of the adaptive immune system activation because infiltration of T cells is significantly observed in juvenile mice and not pups. Cutaneous barrier defects have not been linked to the altered Wnt signaling pathway before. Therefore, we believe that this Wnt-associated phenotype is an interesting finding and will open new questions for future studies.</p><p>The model described in this study establishes that epidermal alterations in Wnt secretion induce cutaneous inflammation. Current concepts of inflammatory skin disorders postulate an important functional role of T cells in the pathogenesis of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lowes et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with these reports, T cell recruitment was observed in Evi-LOF skin. Unlike the vast majority of mature &#x003b1;&#x003b2; T lymphocytes, which reside in secondary lymphoid organs and are recruited upon immune response, subsets of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells preferentially reside in epithelia such as the epidermis, gut, lung, or the genitourinary tract. FACS profiling of mutant adult epithelium revealed two &#x003b3;&#x003b4; TCR<sup>+</sup> populations, a CD3<sup>high</sup>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>high</sup> and a second subpopulation with CD3<sup>low</sup>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>low</sup> cells. Previous studies based on human psoriatic patient material had indicated that the &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cell population is enhanced in psoriatic plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Seung et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, the appearance of CD3<sup>low</sup>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>low</sup> cells in IL23-induced psoriatic dermatitis suggests a common mechanism between this psoriasis mouse model and Evi-LOF skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mabuchi et al., 2011</xref>). Functional impairment at an epithelial interface can be attributed to up-regulation of local &#x003b3;&#x003b4; TCR subsets. Nevertheless, the observed depletion of DETC (CD3<sup>high</sup>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;<sup>high</sup>), which started postnatally, suggests that Wnt-secreting keratinocytes are essential for DETC survival in the murine skin. DETCs play a major role in the maintenance of the epidermal barrier and confine inflammatory infiltration of tissue provoked by conventional &#x003b1;&#x003b2; T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hayday and Tigelaar, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bonneville et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Macleod and Havran, 2011</xref>). It has been shown that DETC-deficient NOD mice develop spontaneous dermatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Girardi, 2004</xref>), suggesting that the absence of DETC in Evi-deficient mice contributed to the observed immune cell dysregulation. IL15 is preferentially expressed in nonlymphoid tissues and promotes growth of DETC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Edelbaum et al., 1995</xref>). Moreover, IL15-LOF mice were deficient in epidermal DETC cells, indicating that IL15 is essential for the survival of DETC in the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Creus et al., 2002</xref>). The down-regulation of IL15 in Evi-LOF skin suggests a role of IL15 as limiting survival factor of DETC in Evi mutants. Interestingly, other &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cell subpopulations, except DETC, are independent of IL15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sumaria et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The results of this study also reveal that partial Evi deficiency in TECs did not contribute to aberrant T cell development. Furthermore, the phenotypic analysis of skin samples from Evi<sup>fl/fl</sup> FoxN1-Cre (FoxN1-Evi-LOF) mice was consistent with these results. FoxN1 expression is restricted to epithelial cells of the thymus from earliest stage of thymus organogenesis and subsets of keratinocytes in the epidermis and in hair follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mecklenburg et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schlake, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gordon et al., 2007</xref>). FoxN1-Evi-LOF mice lead to a mosaic depletion of <italic>Evi</italic> in the epidermis, which caused minor hair loss in the mutant skin. In contrast, FoxN1-Cre induced a more penetrant excision of the <italic>Evi</italic> gene in thymus epithelium compared with K14-Cre and, therefore, a more efficient thymic epithelial knockout. Nevertheless FoxN1-Evi-LOF mice did not develop skin inflammation comparable to that of K14-Evi-LOF, supporting a model whereby Evi depletion in keratinocytes is responsible for the initiation of the psoriasiform dermatitis&#x02013;like phenotype.</p><p>Much progress has been made in the past in defining molecular lesions, which are associated with predisposition to chronic inflammatory skin diseases and consequently also in the development of novel therapeutic modalities. Considering the heterogeneity of the patient phenotypes, the aim of future treatment will be to reduce the immune response and associated angiogenesis as well as hyperplasia. This study shows that epidermal depletion of the Wnt secretion factor Evi unexpectedly triggered skin barrier defect, immune infiltration, and the growth of cutaneous blood vessels and keratinocytes. Taking into account that chronic inflammatory skin diseases are complex multifactorial disorders, which beyond patient-specific heterogeneity also have many inflammatory genes in common, Evi-deficient mice reflect similarities to human cutaneous skin inflammation and suggest that our mutant mice may represent a novel model for psoriasiform dermatitis&#x02013;related diseases. Future studies into the development of novel therapeutics should consider the contribution of Wnt signaling on disease-associated immune modulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mice.</title><p>The vector for the targeting of the <italic>Evi</italic> locus contained loxP sites flanking exon 3 of the <italic>Evi</italic> gene.
