It requires appropriate gene specific expression of the different types of ovarian cells at different developmental stages. To date, most gene expression studies on the ovary were conducted in rodents and did not distinguish the type of cell. In mono-ovulating species, few studies have addressed gene expression profiles and mainly concerned human oocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We used a laser capture microdissection method combined with RNA-seq technology to explore the transcriptome in oocytes and granulosa cells (GCs) during development of the sheep ovarian follicle. We first documented the expression profile of 15 349 genes, then focused on the 5 129 genes showing differential expression between oocytes and GCs. Enriched functional categories such as oocyte meiotic arrest and GC steroid synthesis reflect two distinct cell fates. We identified the implication of GC signal transduction pathways such as SHH, WNT and RHO GTPase. In addition, signaling pathways (VEGF, NOTCH, IGF1, etc.) and GC transzonal projections suggest the existence of complex cell-cell interactions. Finally, we highlighted several transcription regulators and specifically expressed genes that likely play an important role in early folliculogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive exploration of transcriptomes derived from <italic>in vivo</italic> oocytes and GCs at <italic>key</italic> stages in early follicular development in sheep<italic>.</italic> Collectively, our data advance our understanding of early folliculogenesis in mono-ovulating species and will be a valuable resource for unraveling human ovarian dysfunction such as premature ovarian failure (POF).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>RNA-seq</kwd><kwd>Early folliculogenesis</kwd><kwd>Molecular dialog</kwd><kwd>Transcriptome</kwd><kwd>Sheep</kwd><kwd>Oocyte</kwd><kwd>Granulosa cells</kwd><kwd>Microdissection</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The major function of an ovary is to produce oocytes intended for fertilization as eggs and to create a favorable environment for the beginning of gestation. In adult mammals, the ovary is a heterogeneous organ containing follicles at various stages of development and <italic>corpora lutea,</italic> either active or at various stages of involution. The formation of primordial follicles (oocytes surrounded by flattened pre-granulosa cells) occurs during fetal development in many species including human, sheep (from 75&#x000a0;days of gestation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], cattle, and goat, or after birth like in rodents. The primordial follicles represent a reserve of germ cells for the entire reproductive life of the female. They remain dormant until their recruitment and irreversible growth towards the primary, secondary and tertiary stages (with an antral cavity). The gradual exit of primordial follicles begins shortly after the formation of the primordial follicle pool and continues throughout the reproductive years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Consequently, this early development is important as it regulates the size of the resting primordial follicle pool and the fate of the follicles, which, in turn, affects fertility and the reproductive life span.</p><p>Early follicular development requires the appropriate expression of many genes at different developmental stages. Recent studies on natural mutations in sheep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and on mutant mouse models demonstrated that the expression of different oocyte-specific genes is essential during early folliculogenesis in a stage specific expression pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. <italic>Figla</italic>, <italic>Nobox</italic>, <italic>Pten</italic>, <italic>Foxo3A</italic> and nerve growth factor genes are involved in the formation of primordial follicles, whereas genes such as <italic>&#x003b2;FGF</italic>, <italic>GDF 9</italic> and <italic>BMP 4</italic> are involved in the transition from primordial to primary follicles. Other genes such as <italic>BMP15</italic> are not expressed in the oocyte until the primary follicle stage and are involved in the transition from primary to secondary follicles, as shown in sheep (for a review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]).</p><p>This process also requires orchestrated communication between oocytes and granulosa cells (GCs), which are the structural components of the early follicle. Oocytes and GCs regulate follicle growth in an autocrine and paracrine manner via secreted factors and direct gap junctional communications. On one hand, it is assumed that oocytes control the proliferation of GCs and later, their differentiation into steroid secreting cells and their metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. On the other hand, GCs are indispensable to oocyte growth, meiosis, cytoplasmic maturation and control of transcriptional activity within the oocyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This dialog also takes place through GC cytoplasmic extensions that penetrate the <italic>zona pellucida</italic> (ZP) and form gap junctions with oocyte cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Although some large scale expression studies have been conducted on rodent and human oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], expression profiling of follicular compartments is difficult to accomplish due to the very small size of the follicles and the mixture of preantral stages in the ovary. Two studies in particular identified the specific transcriptome of human oocytes in the quiescent state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These studies highlighted enriched functions (transcription, RNA post transcriptional modifications) and molecular mechanisms (cell cycle, androgen signaling) in human oocytes, which were also identified in the only preliminary analysis conducted in sheep species to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. But exactly which granulosa cell factors play a specialized role in early follicular development is not known. Our knowledge of the key mechanisms and the bidirectional communication underlying early folliculogenesis is consequently still very limited and is mainly derived from rodents (poly-ovulating species). Spatial and temporal information on gene expression patterns would facilitate the identification of the regulatory gene networks that underlie cell growth, differentiation, and the functional specification of each follicular compartment.</p><p>The purpose of this study was thus to 1- describe global gene expression during early ovarian folliculogenesis in each follicular compartment (oocyte, GCs) in mono-ovulating species using sheep as the experimental model (whose fertility, litter size, ovulation rate and fetus development is similar to humans, unlike rodents); 2- identify differential and specific gene expression between these two follicular compartments; 3- investigate specific functions and pathways, and 4- explore bi-directional communication between oocytes and GCs. This was achieved using laser capture microdissection (LCM) to isolate oocytes and GCs during the earliest stages of folliculogenesis. Gene expression profiles were monitored at each follicle stage according to cell type using RNA-seq technology. We report the successful isolation and generation of global gene expression data sets of pure oocytes and GC populations at key stages of early follicular development<italic>.</italic> We describe the expression profile of 15 349 genes with 33.4% of genes displaying differential expression between the two compartments. In addition, we identified oocyte and GC-specific gene expression and the pathways involved in oocyte-GC communication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We combined laser capture microdissection (LCM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and RNA-sequencing technologies to detect separate GCs and oocyte global transcriptome for each stage of follicle development: primordial (PD), primary (PM), secondary (SC) follicles and the small antral stage (SA) as control. Three/four biological replicates were obtained per condition (8 conditions: cell type X stage).

A total of 86.8% of the annotated reads are located in stop codon or 3&#x02032;UTR regions, whereas only 5.5% are located in exons, 1.2% in start codon/ 5&#x02032;UTR regions and 6.5% in introns. The final dataset conserved a single fragment per gene corresponding to the nearest 3&#x02032;UTR region with the highest number of reads.

As expected, the number of expressed genes was uniformly distributed between chromosomes according to the number of expected genes except for chromosome 15 on which significantly fewer genes were expressed (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S2A). The percentage of genes transcribed for this chromosome was 57%, compared to an average of 80% for the other chromosomes (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.9%). The chromosome coverage of the expressed genes overlays Oarv2.0 annotated genes (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S2B) except for chromosome 15 on which we identified two regions with fewer expressed genes. The density of expressed genes in these two regions (45&#x02013;50&#x000a0;MB and 77&#x02013;80&#x000a0;Mb) was 75%-90% lower.</p><p>For each sample, the expression levels were measured in read counts per gene (the 3&#x02032; UTR fragment being the most representative) and a normalized expression (RPM&#x02009;=&#x02009;sample gene read count/(sample total mapped read /1 000 000)) was calculated to describe the transcriptome of the tissue. First, we visualized a dynamic range of gene expression between 0.2 and 1 000 RPM (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S3A-B). We estimated that 95% of the genes aggregated 56% of the reads. We then examined the highest expressed genes and detected a clear distinction between cell types (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figures S3C-D). The highest oocyte-expressed genes contributed less to the total number of reads than GCs and multi-tissue samples (MT: 12 different tissues). For example, the ten highest oocyte-expressed genes contributed 4.2% to 4.7% of the total reads, while the highest expressed GC and MT genes contributed respectively 5% to 9.2% and 16.84% of the total reads. In oocytes, the most expressed genes included <italic>ZP2</italic>, <italic>ZP3</italic> and <italic>GDF9</italic>, genes known to be oocyte specific, but also <italic>ACTG</italic>, <italic>PAIP1</italic>, <italic>PDK3</italic>.

Conjointly 9 499 genes were found to be expressed in all the samples (O&#x02009;+&#x02009;GCs&#x02009;+&#x02009;MT) and were considered as ubiquitously expressed genes.

This model allowed statistical evaluation of the factor effects (O, GC) and their interactions. The following criteria including FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.5% to 1% (Benjamini-Hochberg procedure) and a fold change &#x0003e;2 were chosen to determine significant differentially expressed genes. Using these criteria, 33.4% of genes (FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.5%: 5 130 genes) were significantly differentially expressed between the two compartments; 19.6% of genes were significantly differentially expressed during early development (FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1%, 3 015 genes). We observed differences in expression profiles during early folliculogenesis between the two compartments for 4.3% of the genes (interaction effect FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.5%, 674 genes).

The quality of sequencing results was summarized and plotted using the NG6 storage platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ng6.toulouse.inra.fr">http://ng6.toulouse.inra.fr</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Mapping strategy</title><p>The sheep genome sequence recently became available in public databases but the 3&#x02032; UTR non-coding sequences of ovine genes were still poorly documented.

In agreement with Jager [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>], our preliminary analysis showed that the use of bovine transcripts for the annotation substantially increased the number of genes identified. Consequently, genomic fragments and <italic>de novo</italic> contigs were aligned with the bovine genome sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>] (Ensembl <italic>Bos taurus</italic> UMD3.1) using Blat.

Iteratively, for <italic>Bos taurus</italic> slices not linked to a described gene, we searched for overlaps with downstream gene regions extended by 500&#x000a0;bp, 1&#x000a0;kb and 3&#x000a0;kb (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S6B).</p><p>All the non-annotated genomic fragments and contigs (not mapped to the bovine transcript) were discarded from the data set.

For each sample, the reads were mapped with bwa aln on the 4 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> sequences. The RPKM (reads per kilobase of exon per million) was computed for each control transcript. To make the samples comparable for experimental validation, the amount of each <italic>B. subtilis</italic> control transcript was calculated for each sample in proportion to the highest one (DAP).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The significance of differential gene expression was determined using DESeq package for multifactor design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] in R software (R 2.14.0; DESeq release 1.6.1) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S6C). Our experimental design included 2 factors: stage (with 4 levels: PD, PM, SC and SA) and compartment (2 levels: O, GCs) with interactions. After DESeq normalization, the best dispersion estimation of our data set was obtained using the following arguments: method &#x02018;pooled&#x02019;, sharingMode &#x02018;fit-only&#x02019;, fitType &#x02018;local&#x02019;. The GLM method was then used to estimate the coefficient and deviance for each gene. For inference, we specified three models: the full model regressing gene expression on both compartments and follicular stages and taking interaction effects into account (count&#x02009;~&#x02009;stage*compartment), the additive model (count&#x02009;~&#x02009;stage&#x02009;+&#x02009;compartment) and the reduced model (count&#x02009;~&#x02009;1). We tested the effects of the compartments, follicle stages, and their interactions on gene expression using nbinomGLMTest. Differential gene expression between compartments and differential expression profiles between compartments (interaction effect) were selected with FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.5% (Benjamini-Hochberg procedure) and a fold change &#x0003e;2. To establish the differential expression profile during early follicular development, we selected genes whose intra-compartment variance was differentially expressed in at least one of the stages (nbinomGLMTest). Thereafter, for each compartment, the expression value of each gene at each follicle stage was compared using pairwise comparison (nbinomTest). Differential gene expression during early follicular development was selected with a FDR &#x0003c;5% for global &#x02018;intra-compartment&#x02019; effect (nbinomGLMTest) and pval &#x0003c;1% for pairwise comparison (nbinomTest) with a fold change &#x0003e;2.</p><p>The most expressed genes in a specific compartment (O, GCs) were identified using pairwise comparisons with FDR &#x0003c;0.5% and a fold change &#x0003e;10 for the oocyte compartment (O/GCs&#x02009;+&#x02009;MT) and &#x0003e;5 for GC compartment (GCs/O&#x02009;+&#x02009;MT).</p></sec><sec><title>Biological trends</title><p>Ingenuity&#x000ae; Pathway Analysis software (IPA; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ingenuity.com">http://www.ingenuity.com</ext-link>) was used to examine functional and molecular pathway enrichment for differentially expressed genes based on Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. This software combines functional annotations of differentially expressed genes (focus genes) and the corresponding bibliographic data to generate significant signaling pathways and regulation networks. The biological analysis focused on the list of differentially expressed genes. The Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base was used as the reference set.</p><p>Functional category analysis identified the functions in the IPA library that were most significant to the input data set. The significance of the association between the data set and the functional category was determined by a P value calculated using Fischer&#x02019;s exact test corrected for multiple testing (p-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05; FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 (Benjamini-Hochberg test)).</p><p>Canonical pathway analysis identified the pathways in the IPA library of canonical pathways that were most significant to the input data set. The significance of the association between the data set and the canonical pathway was determined based on two parameters: (1) the ratio of the number of genes from the data set that mapped to the pathway divided by the total number of genes that mapped to the canonical pathway and (2) a P value calculated using Fischer&#x02019;s exact test corrected for multiple testing to determine the probability that the association between the genes in the data set and the canonical pathway is due to chance alone (p-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05; FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05-0.25 (FDR threshold &#x0003c;0.25 is proposed as appropriate for enrichment gene sets in BROAD GSEA analyses (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/doc/GSEAUserGuideFrame.html">http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/doc/GSEAUserGuideFrame.html</ext-link>). In these conditions, the result is likely to be valid 3 out of 4 times).</p><p>Downstream effects analysis was used to identify the expected effect of the observed change in gene expression on the functions (expected to increase or decrease). This analysis examined genes in our data set that are known to affect functions, compared the gene direction of change to expectations derived from the literature, and provided a prediction for each function based on the direction of change (in the list of differential gene expression). IPA uses the regulation z-score algorithm to make predictions.</p><p>In the same way, IPA upstream regulator analysis was used to understand the cause of the observed change in gene expression. This analysis identifies the cascade of upstream transcriptional regulators (any molecules that can affect the expression of other molecules) that can explain the observed change in gene expression in the dataset. The overlap pvalue measures statistically significant differences between genes in the data set and the genes that are regulated by a transcriptional regulator. The activator z-score infers the activation state to the transcriptional regulator (activator z-score&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;&#x02212;2 and &#x0003e;2). Without identified bias, this z-score can always be used as an independent test to call downstream regulators. A bias means that the activation z-score and pvalue must be used to call downstream regulators. The expression and/or differential expression of the transcriptional regulator in the data set provides more evidence for the biological mechanism.</p><p>Combining oocyte and GC upstream effect/ regulator analyses provided clues to the putative regulation involved in the oocyte-GC dialog.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis for gene expression</title><p>Gene primers were designed from RNA-seq sequences (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">10</xref>).
