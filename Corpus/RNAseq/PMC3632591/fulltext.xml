We hypothesized RNA-Seq would reveal more differentially expressed genes (DEG) than microarray analysis, including low copy and novel transcripts related to AFB1&#x02019;s carcinogenic activity compared to feed controls (CTRL). Paired-end reads were mapped to the rat genome (Rn4) with TopHat and further analyzed by DESeq and Cufflinks-Cuffdiff pipelines to identify differentially expressed transcripts, new exons and unannotated transcripts. PCA and cluster analysis of DEGs showed clear separation between AFB1 and CTRL treatments and concordance among group replicates. qPCR of eight high and medium DEGs and three low DEGs showed good comparability among RNA-Seq and microarray transcripts. DESeq analysis identified 1,026 differentially expressed transcripts at greater than two-fold change (p&#x0003c;0.005) compared to 626 transcripts by microarray due to base pair resolution of transcripts by RNA-Seq, probe placement within transcripts or an absence of probes to detect novel transcripts, splice variants and exons. Pathway analysis among DEGs revealed signaling of Ahr, Nrf2, GSH, xenobiotic, cell cycle, extracellular matrix, and cell differentiation networks consistent with pathways leading to AFB1 carcinogenesis, including almost 200 upregulated transcripts controlled by E2f1-related pathways related to kinetochore structure, mitotic spindle assembly and tissue remodeling. We report 49 novel, differentially-expressed transcripts including confirmation by PCR-cloning of two unique, unannotated, hepatic AFB1-responsive transcripts (HAfT&#x02019;s) on chromosomes 1.q55 and 15.q11, overexpressed by 10 to 25-fold. Several potentially novel exons were found and exon refinements were made including AFB1 exon-specific induction of homologous family members, Ugt1a6 and Ugt1a7c. We find the rat transcriptome contains many previously unidentified, AFB1-responsive exons and transcripts supporting RNA-Seq&#x02019;s capabilities to provide new insights into AFB1-mediated gene expression leading to hepatocellular carcinoma.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the Intramural Research Programs of the National Toxicology Program Division and Division of Intramural Research at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Our findings suggest that RNA-Seq identified almost double the number of unannotated transcripts compared to microarray analysis.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0061768-t002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0061768.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Reference-Guided Assembly of RNA-Seq Reads into Transcripts by Cufflinks<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt102">a</xref>.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0061768-t002-2" xlink:href="pone.0061768.t002"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total Transcripts Assembled</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">57,076</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Complete Match, RefSeq</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14,257</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Partial Match, RefSeq</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30,887</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Novel Candidates</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11,932</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt102"><label>a</label><p>Cufflinks was employed to assemble reads into transcripts from each animal sample and Cuffcompare was used to obtain a union of transcripts from all 8 animals as summarized in this panel. &#x02018;Total Transcripts Assembled&#x02019; was the sum of Complete, Partial and Novel transcripts. &#x02018;Complete Match&#x02019; transcripts were identical to RefSeq transcripts (intron chain matches RefSeq gene); transcripts in the &#x02018;Partially Match&#x02019; category include transcripts that overlap RefSeq transcripts but do not completely match (these could include potentially novel isoforms of an existing RefSeq transcript); and potentially &#x02018;Novel&#x02019; transcripts are those that did not overlap with any RefSeq transcripts at all and may therefore involve intergenic transcripts.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap id="pone-0061768-t003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0061768.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Analysis for Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt103">a</xref>.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0061768-t003-3" xlink:href="pone.0061768.t003"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Transcripts by Analysis</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TotalAssembled</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RefSeq</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Novel</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total CuffCompare(&#x02212; &#x02018;Others&#x02019;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">57,076</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">45,144</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11,932</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cufflinks (MA probe+RNASeq)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">44,469</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">38,186</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6,283</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">DESeq DEG<sup>(2X Fold, p&#x0003c;0.005)</sup></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1,026</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">945</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">81</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Microarray (MA) DEG<sup>(2X Fold,</sup><sup>p&#x0003c;0.005)</sup></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">626</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">558</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">68</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cuffdiff DEG<sup>(2X Fold, p&#x0003c;0.005)</sup></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">119</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">108</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt103"><label>a</label><p>Transcripts were grouped by various combinations of analysis into three columns: Total Assembled transcripts; RefSeq - transcripts matching or partially matching RefSeq genes; and Novel transcripts. In the first row, Total CuffCompare transcripts included all transcripts (57,076); RefSeq transcripts (complete or partial match) were 45,144 (14,257+30,887&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;45,144); and 11,932 potentially novel transcripts. Note, that a set of 1,496 Cufflinks assembled transcripts referred to as, &#x02018;Others&#x02019;, contained significant repeat sequences and so this small set of transcripts was excluded (e.g. &#x02013;&#x02018;Others&#x02019;) from Total Assembled transcripts. In row 2, to enable comparison with available Microarray data, we identified Cufflinks assembled transcripts that overlapped MA probes (total 44,469 transcripts). From this group of transcripts, we determined differential expression (DEGs) using student&#x02019;s t-test in the case of MA (microarray) data in row 4, or for RNA-Seq data we performed DESeq analysis in row 3 or Cuffdiff analysis in row 5 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Comparison of Cufflinks transcript level signals among the four samples within the CTRL or AFB1 treatment groups showed a high degree of correlation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0061768.s003">Figure S3</xref>) with correlation coefficients (r<sup>2</sup>) uniformly about 0.98. Similarly, high r<sup>2</sup> values (0.96&#x02013;0.99) were observed for normalized probe intensities for microarray data between samples for each treatment group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0061768.s004">Figure S4</xref>). The results of these analyses indicate that hepatic gene expression of rats that were measured by RNA-Seq and microarray platforms were highly stable and reproducible.</p><p>DESeq and Cuffdiff were used to test for differential expression on Cufflinks assembled transcripts. Among the large number of expressed liver transcripts, our initial differential expression analysis focused upon changes in well annotated genes from RefSeqGene as defined by RefSeq annotations. RefSeqGene is a subset of NCBI&#x02019;s Reference Sequence (RefSeq) project and defines genomic sequences that have sufficient literature support as reference standards for well-characterized genes that generally represent a prevalent, &#x02018;standard&#x02019; allele. For differential expression of RNA-Seq data, we used Cufflinks for transcript assembly followed by Cuffdiff or DESeq for their different capabilities in measuring and comparing transcript changes between groups. RNA-Seq and microarray data were generated from the same RNA sample for each animal to permit direct comparison of differential expression from two high throughput platforms. Correlation analysis of Cufflinks transcript expression (RNA-Seq) and normalized probe intensities (microarray) were performed by first dividing genes into quartiles, based on their expression levels in control conditions, and then correlating expression measurements originating from either RNA-Seq or microarray platforms. A correlation was performed for all animal samples from CTRL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0061768.s005">Figure S5</xref>) and for AFB1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0061768.s006">Figure S6</xref>) treated animal samples. As expected, the highest correlations were found for highly expressed transcripts in quartile 4, with a comparatively weaker correlation among transcripts in the lower quartiles. These data indicate that a better correlation occurs between RNA-Seq and microarray platforms as signal level increases.</p><p>The number of DEGs obtained at a 2-fold cutoff and unadjusted p&#x0003c;0.005 from RNA-Seq data by Cuffdiff and DESeq were compared to microarray profiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061768-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). DESeq identified 1,026 DEGs which were 8.6 times more than the 119 DEGs identified by Cuffdiff and almost twice the 626 DEGs detected by microarray analysis. Among the DEGs, about 90% of the transcripts were annotated by RefSeq for each of the DESeq, Cuffdiff and microarray analyses, leaving approximately 10% that were potentially novel, differentially expressed transcripts. Venn diagram analysis of DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061768-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) shows the common and unique transcripts shared among the three analyses for DEGs from RNASeq (DESeq and Cuffdiff) and Microarray platforms. Unique and common transcripts from the Venn diagram are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0061768.s011">Table S1</xref>. The top 30 expressed transcripts among the three platforms are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0061768.s012">Table S2</xref>. The proportion of DEGs that were shared between RNA-Seq and microarray varied by analysis; 62.6% (392/626 transcripts) for DESeq and 8.1% (51/626 transcripts) for Cuffdiff analysis. Reasons for varying differential expression by Cuffdiff compared to DESeq likely relate to the depth of sequencing, unique distribution of genes and their expression levels in liver tissue and fragment alignment cutoffs for statistical comparison of low expression genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061768-Trapnell1">[27]</xref>. As a result of greater DEGs, we focused on DESeq transcripts for further comparison to microarray data. The PCA plot showed clear separation between CTRL and AFB1 treated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061768-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Cluster analysis of all samples using DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061768-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) shows a similar increase and decrease in transcript expression produced by AFB1 exposure compared to CTRL as well as a high degree of intragroup homogeneity of expression for both DESeq and microarray analyses. We note that in comparing expression platforms, transcript normalization was uncorrected for length since we computed fold differences for each corresponding transcript in CTRL and AFB1 groups and not across different transcripts. When RPKM normalization for RNA-Seq data was computed and compared to microarray data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0061768.s013">Table S3</xref>) we found results were similar to those presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061768-g001">Figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0061768-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0061768.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified from RNA-Seq by DESeq and Cuffdiff compared to microarray.</title><p>Panel A.

Investigation into several example cases, as described in the gene tracks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061768-g003">Figure 3</xref>, revealed several possible explanations that generally involved greater nucleotide level resolution data provided by RNA-Seq analysis which allows for both accurate quantification of expression levels and precise demarcation of exon boundaries compared to probe hybridization. For example, Eda2r (ectodysplasin A2 receptor) is a plasma membrane bound receptor regulating initiation, morphogenesis and differentiation of ectodermally-derived organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061768-Mikkola1">[28]</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061768-g003">Figure 3A</xref> shows a novel extension at the 3&#x02032;-end of the Eda2r transcript (open arrows) as assembled by Cufflinks. These additional reads observed in an assembled transcript, Cufflinks_00063097, are responsible for the larger fold increase at 45.5-fold by DESeq and are not reflected by the smaller increase of 6.3-fold of single probe (A_44_P387120) data at the 6<sup>th</sup> exon. It appears likely that these additional reads in RNA-Seq comprise an undescribed UTR (observed continuity of reads, no exon breaks) portion of the Eda2r transcript but additional work will be needed to support this hypothesis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061768-g003">Figure 3B</xref> shows how probe placement can affect which genes are identified as differentially expressed between platforms. The probe, A_44_P703664, for the RefSeq transcript of Srxn1 (sulfiredoxin 1; GSH-depletion related oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061768-Gao1">[29]</xref>) which was placed in the 3&#x02032;-region (3&#x02032;-end microarray probe design <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061768-Borczuk1">[30]</xref>) detects no significant change at 1.4-fold from AFB1 treatment. However, DESeq measured a 3.5-fold increase for a transcript (Cufflinks_00036333) which represents expression of all exons and UTRs that are identical to the RefSeq transcript (NM_001047858) for Srxn1.

The HAfT&#x02019;s were further confirmed with independent validation by Sanger sequencing.

HAfT1 was found in all four animal samples with an average upregulation of 21.5-fold in AFB1 treated rats compared to CTRL and is located in an intergenic region between rat Tcf7l2 (NM001191052) and Habp2 (RGD:1302979). Comparative genomics shows this intergenic region in the rat corresponds to the first intron of the homologous mouse Tcf7l1 gene (NM009332) in which HAfT1 is in an antisense orientation. No prior ESTs correspond to HAfT1. Primers were designed from the sequence of the Cufflinks transcript to clarify the exons of HAfT1. Sequencing of cloned PCR products from two AFB1 rats (AFB1-0 and AFB1-1) showed an 809 bp cDNA that aligned with predicted exons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0061768.s007">Figure S7A</xref>). A hypothetical peptide sequence of 115 amino acids could be translated from a putative ATG start site at position 31 before encountering a stop codon. Preliminary analysis suggests this novel AFB1-responsive gene may be protein coding although further experiments will be needed to demonstrate a translation product. A second transcript, HAfT2, is also reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061768-g004">Figure 4C</xref> as a proposed 4 exon transcript (a combined product of Cufflinks_00021611 and Cufflinks_00022036) on Chr15.q11. The Cufflinks_00021611 transcript was upregulated an average of 8.5-fold by AFB1 treatment compared to the CTRL group. In this case, two exons of rat EST AA851790 partially overlapped with the Cufflinks transcripts. We note that there was no evidence of any reads from our RNA-Seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061768-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) to support the presence of the first designated exon in the EST AA851790 (in liver tissue).

However, alternative gene isoforms present certain challenges to both RNA-Seq and microarray for the accurate quantitation of transcript expression levels and the ability to distinguish one isoform from another. We explored such a case for Ugt1a transcripts, belonging to the UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A cluster, which are actively expressed phase II, conjugators of xenobiotics and relevant for AFB1 toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061768-Aninat1">[33]</xref>. Ugt1a isoforms share the last four exons but generally contain one unique 5&#x02032;-exon to define each isoform. RefSeq annotation currently contains eight isoforms for this gene family, namely, Ug1a1, Ugt1a2, Ugt1a3, Ugt1a5, Ugt1a6 and Ugt1a7c, Ugt1a8 and Ugt1a9. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061768-g006">Figure 6A</xref> shows assembled transcripts for Ugt1a1 isoforms except for Ugt1a8 and Ugt1a9 which were not expressed. Expression of the four common exons at the 3&#x02032;-end of Ugt1a gene family is similar in CTRL and AFB1 samples which is evident from the fold change observed for the two microarray &#x02018;Ugta1a-Common&#x02019; probes as well as the fold change measured by RNA-Seq for each of the individual exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061768-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Expression changes of AFB1 vs. CTRL were about two-fold for all Ugt1a isoforms using RNA-Seq primarily because the four common exons contribute the majority of reads mapped to each isoform, potentially masking any fold change observed in isoform specific 5&#x02032;-exon(s). For example, AFB1 specific induction of the two unique exons for Ugt1a6 isoform in AFB1 was not observed when ratios were calculated for the whole transcript. By contrast, the microarray probe annotated specifically for Ugt1a6 isoform was elevated by 7.3 fold. Only when exon specific reads from RNA-Seq data were counted for isoform specific exons of Ugt1a6 (exons 1 and 2) were the fold change values found to be comparable (induction of 6.7 and 5.4 fold, respectively). On the other hand, RNA-Seq analysis provided clear evidence for expression of both Ugt1a5 and Ugt1a7c, whereas no microarray data were available because microarray probes were absent for these genes. RNA-Seq exon specific reads showed a 2.7 fold increase for Ugt1a7, though this was not statistically significant. Thus, exon specific data from RNA-Seq reads or microarray probes placed at isoform defining exons appear best qualified to give credible isoform measurements among homologous family members.</p><fig id="pone-0061768-g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0061768.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Exon specific expression among homologous transcripts in the Ugt1a gene family.</title><p>Panel A.

Pathway analysis assisted us in determining the biological effects of AFB1 exposure using genes with statistically significant differential expression. DEGs from AFB1 exposure were contained in various canonical pathways for which 26 were common (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0061768.s016">Table S6</xref>) to the three approaches used for differential expression. Representative pathways involved xenobiotic metabolism (AhR and xenobiotic metabolism signaling, glutathione metabolism), cell cycle dysregulation (G1/S checkpoint regulation, cyclins and cell cycle, ATM signaling, estrogen-mediated S-phase entry), malignancy pathways (glioma and hereditary breast cancer signaling), Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress, and ten various intermediary and amino acid metabolism pathways. Since the categories of canonical pathways found by RNA-Seq platforms and microarrays were similar, we considered the type and number of interrelationships among DEGs datasets as another means of identifying potential drivers of biological alterations that could set the stage for AFB1 carcinogenesis. Twenty-six transcripts showed substantial connections from DEGs by DESeq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061768-g007">Figure 7A</xref>).

We hypothesized that the increased dynamic range and base pair resolution capabilities of RNA-Seq would allow for a more sensitive detection of transcripts, as well as, for the detection of new isoforms and gene products, resulting in an enhanced understanding of the AFB1 liver transcriptome. &#x02018;Within group&#x02019; comparisons based on 4 rats per group indicated a high degree of reproducibility among samples. Cufflinks customization was used to assemble transcripts and DESeq and Cuffdiff were used to determine DEGs (&#x02265;2X fold; p&#x0003c;0.005) from RNA-Seq data and were compared to similarly filtered microarray DEGs. Using DESeq, a total of 1,026 DEGs were found which were more than 400 transcripts or 63% greater than microarray DEGs. Testing of differential expression by Cuffdiff proved to be more stringent resulting in far fewer DEGs in our study, so we employed a Cufflinks pipeline for reference-based assembly and used the assembled transcript definitions with DESeq for differential expression testing. Although we observed a substantial overlap of DEGs by DESeq and microarray, some DEGs were observed which were unique to either platform. When normalized gene expression of RNA-Seq and microarray data were separated into four quartiles ranked on the basis of average control signal across replicates, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient increased going from lowest to highest expression genes. This indicates that transcripts with low microarray signal or small read counts contribute to the weak correlation between platforms for low expression genes and some of the differences in observed unique DEGs between RNA-Seq and microarray. However, other factors for platform differences are the presence of novel exons and full length transcripts in the rat transcriptome shown by RNA-Seq data which have not yet been annotated by microarray probes. Notably, both platforms easily separated treated animals by PCA and cluster analysis. qPCR validation of eleven selected transcripts covering a wide range of expression showed good agreement in direction and fold-increase for gene expression among expression platforms. Overall, RNA-Seq produced a more comprehensive DEG profile than microarray analysis under the conditions of our study, which was due to measuring reads across the entire transcriptome in agreement with the conclusions of other reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061768-Su1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061768-Bottomly1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061768-Malone1">[40]</xref>.</p><p>Representative criteria for DEGs at &#x02265;2-fold differences and p&#x02264;0.005 demonstrated areas of overlap and uniqueness between RNA-Seq (DESeq and Cuffdiff) and microarray observed by Venn diagram analysis. Many reasons were found for these differences. For example, the detection of reads from a transcript for which no probe was assigned was a common finding which is understandable considering the more complete mapping provided by RNA-Seq data. RNA-Seq provided data at either the 3&#x02032;-end or 5&#x02032;-end of RefSeq or Ensembl transcripts or sometimes in unannotated regions of the transcriptome for which microarray probes did not exist (e.g., Chr8 Cufflinks transcripts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061768-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), or had not been assigned any specific annotation (e.g., probes at 3&#x02032;-Utr of Stxbp5L). Probe placement within specific regions of a transcript also appeared to be a determinant for differential expression since the collective number of RNA-Seq reads per transcript could outweigh a single probe or even multiple probe signals for DEG criteria. For example, 3.7-fold increase in reads across the Srxn1 transcript by DESeq was in contrast to no change in signal by microarray from the probe located within the 3&#x02032;-UTR. Probe placement and probe annotation as well as the large number of RNA-Seq reads counted across the length of each transcript were factors that greatly influenced the number of DEGs found by RNA-Seq compared to microarray platforms.</p><p>Another important aspect of gene expression is the Cufflinks-derived exon expression compared to RefSeq annotations to determine known exons, novel exon boundaries and novel exons. It is important to note that for this analysis we only analyzed those exons that had a significant signal, so that exons with low and possibly irreproducible signal were removed from consideration. Classifications were defined as &#x02018;Exact&#x02019; exon matches, &#x02018;Overlapping&#x02019; or &#x02018;Within&#x02019; matches and &#x02018;Novel&#x02019; exons either within (&#x02212;T) or outside (U-unclassified) RefSeq transcript structure. A majority of the &#x02018;Exact&#x02019; matches were found as &#x02018;Common&#x02019; to CTRL or AFB1 groups (3650 exons) with many fewer as unique to either treatment. Interestingly, there were many more &#x02018;Overlap&#x02019; exons for AFB1 or CTRL groups than were shared (Common). These data likely represent the substantial splicing and differences in exon junctions (accompanying the large concordance of &#x02018;Exact&#x02019; exon matches) between treatment groups. For example, nearly 20,000 previously unreported exon junctions were uncovered after annotation-based mapping of mammalian RNA-Seq reads by TopHat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061768-Trapnell2">[41]</xref>. In addition, we also report about 200 shared and unique &#x02018;Novel-T&#x02019; exons which were found between exons of known transcripts, such as F11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061768-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), and almost 100 &#x02018;Within&#x02019; exons which were also identified. The number of &#x02018;Novel-U&#x02019; exons is of particular interest since approximately 1,000 were found for CTRL or AFB1 groups, such as new 5&#x02032;-exons for ASS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061768-g005">Figure 5D</xref>), and 179 Novel-U exons which were common to each group.</p><p>Ugt1a isoforms represent a specific case posing a challenge for measurement of each isoform using either RNA-Seq or microarray. The UGT1 family consists of thirteen genes that are all five exons in length for which exon 2 to exon 5 are common for all UGT1 mRNAs but the first exon is unique to each gene (UGT1A1 to UGT1A13P) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061768-Maruo1">[42]</xref>. Since the shared exons comprising each Ugt1a isoform cannot be definitively assigned to any one isoform, exon-specific probes or RNA-Seq signal at each isoform-defining exon would be required for accurate differential expression. Exon-specific reads from RNA-Seq could be measured in our analysis but several Ugt1a isoforms (e.g. Ugt1a7c, Ugt1a5 Ugt1a3 and Ugt1a2) did not have designated microarray probes for measurement. In the present study, we report subchronic AFB1 exposure causes isoform specific upregulation in Ugt1a6 and possibly for Ugt1a7c.

It is also worth noting that specialized methods such as CAGE (cap analysis of gene expression) can complement RNA-Seq data in studying genes with multiple isoforms since CAGE selects for 5&#x02032;-mRNA ends to find exact locations of TSSs (transcription start sites) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061768-Bajic1">[47]</xref>.

Several hundred (observed in two or more animals) to thousands (observed in at least one animal of each group of four animals) of putative, novel transcripts were found in control or AFB1 treated animals depending on the level of replication stringency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061768-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The number of novel shared transcripts as &#x02018;AFB1+ Control&#x02019; remained higher (927, 479, and 234 novel transcripts, at two, three, and four of four animals, respectively) than transcripts unique to either Control or AFB1 alone at similar levels of replication. These data suggest a limited number of treatment-specific, novel transcripts for follow-up study. We validated two such novel AFB1-responsive transcripts identifying them as HAfT1 and HAfT2 on Chr1.q55 and Chr15.q11, respectively. Four exons comprising an 809 bp cDNA were confirmed by PCR cloning for HAfT1. There is no known prior annotation or EST corresponding to this transcript suggesting it is a completely novel gene about 150 kD downstream from rat 5&#x02032;-end of the RefSeq gene Tcf7l2 in antisense orientation. This region of rat Chr1 also bears some homology to a portion the first intron of mouse Tcf7l1. A second novel AFB1-responsive gene homologous to one spliced EST (AA851790) was cloned as a 209 cDNA sequence corresponding to the last exon of this proposed 4 exon transcript, made up of two overlapping Cufflinks transcripts (00021611 and 00022036). Ongoing work will clarify the expression and function of these two novel transcripts regarding their upregulated response to AFB1 exposure.</p><p>A further objective of our study was to generate new insights into alterations in gene networks that might lead to the formation of hepatocellular carcinomas.

The base pair resolution of RNA-Seq provides an expanded depth of gene expression changes and therefore increased annotation of the rat liver transcriptome. We report novel genes, HAfT1 and HAfT2, and potentially other transcripts that may prove important to chemical response and liver biology. Pathway analysis findings were interpreted as a reflection of a slow hepatocellular turnover supported by an active stem cell population in response to continual, low level, genotoxic injury by AFB1 in the presence of barely perceptible apoptosis. Expression of various ECM proteases suggests a pattern of tissue remodeling and activation of surface receptors that favor tumor development and progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061768-Coban1">[76]</xref>. Differential expression of numerous components and associated kinases of the mitotic spindle assembly and kinetochore structure that support cell division are visible in this type of AFB1 feed exposure model which might otherwise be masked by other high dose, injurious models of chemical carcinogenesis. While the structure of the pathways reported here is contextualized to AFB1 exposure, it could form the basis for further hypothesis testing of other carcinogenic agents for similar transcriptional drivers, signaling pathways, activation of kinases, affected subcellular structures and transcriptional changes within specific areas of the liver architecture. Collectively, these findings highlight the potential contribution of toxicant-mediated perturbations of the transcriptome as a special tool for novel gene discovery using high resolution, NextGen sequencing technologies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>RNA Extraction, Transcript Profiling and Illumina Sequencing</title><p>All experiments were performed in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act and the U.S. Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals after review and approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Battelle Laboratories, Columbus, OH.

These methods represent two widely accepted and complementary analysis approaches of RNA-Seq data. For DESeq analysis, we first obtained RefSeq gene annotation for all known genes in the rat genome, as provided by the UCSC genome browser as of Oct 2011. RefSeqGene is a subset of NCBI&#x02019;s Reference Sequence (RefSeq) project and defines genomic sequences that have sufficient literature support as reference standards for well-characterized genes that generally represent a prevalent &#x02018;standard&#x02019; allele. This annotation included 17,194 unique transcript entries with genomic coordinates. Using the reads mapped to the genome, we calculated the number of reads mapped to each transcript in the above RefSeq annotation table. These raw read counts were used as input to DESeq for calculation of normalized signal for each transcript in the CTRL and AFB1 samples, and differential expression was reported as Fold Change along with associated p-values. DESeq calculates p-values using a negative binomial distribution which accounts for technical as well as biological variability. The DESeq approach is well suited for count data (read counts) as is the case for RNA-Seq experiments, and the method estimates variance in a local fashion for varying signal strength <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0061768-Trapnell3">[79]</xref>.</p><p>Cufflinks is a complementary method that assembles transcripts and estimates its abundance using read data.

Among those that were found in more than one replicate, we further narrowed our list by requiring the novel transcript display statistically significant differential expression (absolute Fold Change &#x0003e;2, p-value&#x0003c;0.005 as calculated using the DESeq method).

Canonical pathways that were found to be enriched in the DEG datasets were determined. The significance value associated with overrepresented pathways measures the likelihood that association between an experimental gene set and molecules in Reference gene sets for a specific process or pathway is due to random chance. In general, p-values less than 0.05 indicate a statistically significant, non-random association. The p-value is calculated with the right-tailed Fisher's Exact Test. Ingenuity uses public databases (e.g. HumanCyc) and performs in-house curation to formulate and update signaling pathways. In our study, pathways were constructed with the Build pathways function using either the &#x02018;Connect&#x02019; feature for RefSeq annotated DEGs of our microarray, DESeq and Cuffdiff datasets or the &#x02018;Grow&#x02019; feature. The Connect feature displayed annotated relationships among DEGs within each dataset, while the Grow feature showed upstream and downstream relationships among DEGs in the DESeq dataset. The &#x02018;Connect&#x02019; feature shows relationships among transcripts that have been annotated by Ingenuity&#x000ae;Systems according to the following categories: direct and indirect Interactions, expert and third party Data Sources, various Species, Tissues and Cell lines, Diseases, Molecules (e.g. chemicals and pharmaceuticals) and Biofluids. A pathway of &#x02018;Connect&#x02019; relationships was constructed by applying these annotated categories for each DEG dataset from DESeq, microarray and CuffDiff. Hub genes (bolded, enlarged gene symbols in pathway) were defined as those transcripts showing regulation or interaction with equal to or more than five other transcripts. The &#x02018;Grow&#x02019; feature uses a specified transcript of interest as a starting point to find relationships (upstream, downstream, direct and indirect relationships) between that transcript and other molecules of interest. The E2f1 pathway was constructed by the &#x02018;Grow&#x02019; feature using only the DEG dataset from DESeq analysis, filtered by direct and indirect Interactions from all molecules that are upstream or downstream on specified transcripts. &#x02018;Grow&#x02019; started on the E2f1 transcript and we then tested subsequent downstream DEGs in which we defined regulatory transcripts (bolded, enlarged gene symbols in pathway) as those with equal to or greater than five connections (interactions or relationships).
