Phenotypic convergence can arise from molecular convergence at one or more functional levels (that is, mutation, gene, pathway and so on) or by totally independent means. Given the opportunity for widespread functional diversity, a long-standing question in biology is whether evolution is predictable and, if so, under what circumstances? Our knowledge about the molecular basis of convergent evolution comes primarily from examples of convergence among closely related populations or species in response to a shared environment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. This work suggests that re-use of genes and pathways is common on short evolutionary timescales<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, but there is an expectation that the constraints that promote molecular convergence should erode over evolutionary time, leading to a diversity of functional mechanisms in comparisons among distantly related organisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. We currently lack a detailed knowledge of the specific molecular mechanisms underlying convergence at these phylogenetic depths.</p><p>Butterfly wing patterns provide a unique opportunity to address the molecular basis of convergent evolution over deep evolutionary time because despite their incredible diversity, the wing patterns of this old evolutionary radiation are built from a conserved ground plan<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. This permits us to investigate whether similar shifts in wing pattern among distantly related butterflies are controlled by homologous genes or pathways, and whether the causative nucleotide variation is conserved over evolutionary time<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Prior work suggests two very different predictions. On one hand, natural colour pattern variation routinely maps back to a core set of melanin pathway genes; this is true in both invertebrates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> and vertebrates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, although the specific genes and pathways differ markedly between these two clades<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. This suggests that the same pathway can be a recurrent target of selection for colour pattern variation in a given clade. In contrast, recent work on butterfly wing patterning suggests that its genetic basis is highly labile over evolutionary time. For instance, comparative analyses of gene expression show that while a set of developmental genes are used routinely for eyespot patterning<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, the specific genes that are expressed in a given species and wing position are variable, as are the links between each gene and the adult phenotype it specifies. Furthermore, the gene <italic>optix</italic> has recently been shown to specify red and brown wing pattern elements in <italic>Heliconius</italic> butterflies, but not outside the genus, suggesting recent co-option in this one lineage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Overall, these contrasting observations yield two very different hypotheses for the genetic control of butterfly wing pattern variation across deep evolutionary time, one predicting ancient homology and the other recent innovation.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Positional cloning of the colour-patterning locus</title><p>To investigate the genetic basis of wing pattern diversity, we first compared the genetic architecture of pattern formation in two butterfly systems, <italic>Limenitis</italic> and <italic>Heliconius</italic>, that exhibit convergent variation in mimetic colour patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Natural selection for mimicry between <italic>Limenitis</italic> and its unpalatable model, <italic>Battus philenor</italic>, has produced a hybrid zone between wing pattern races of <italic>Limenitis arthemis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, a non-mimetic, white-banded (ancestral) form and an unbanded, mimetic (derived) form. We used crosses between mimetic (<italic>L. a. astyanax</italic>) and non-mimetic (<italic>L. a. arthemis</italic>) individuals to map the position of the genomic region controlling mimetic wing pattern variation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Our crosses revealed that white-band patterning in <italic>Limenitis</italic> segregates as a single Mendelian locus, and based on syntenic comparisons maps to a homologous chromosomal position in <italic>Heliconius</italic> that is known to contain the colour-patterning locus, <italic>Ac</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Martin <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> demonstrated that the <italic>Ac</italic> locus, which controls medial pattern shape in <italic>Heliconius</italic> forewings, maps to a genomic interval containing the diffusible signalling ligand <italic>WntA</italic>. <italic>WntA</italic> is a member of a larger family of Wnt signalling genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> that encode secreted ligands involved in cell signalling across a wide range of developmental processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> including examples of insect pigmentation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. By fine-mapping the colour-patterning chromosome in <italic>Limenitis</italic>, we reduced the zero-recombinant window to a 291-kb interval that contained just three genes, two chitin synthase genes and <italic>WntA</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that variation in the function or regulation of <italic>WntA</italic> likely mediates medial pattern formation in both <italic>Heliconius</italic> and <italic>Limenitis</italic>, two species that diverged 65 million years ago<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Developmental patterns of gene expression</title><p>To test this hypothesis, we examined the developmental basis of wing pattern formation in <italic>Limenitis</italic> using a combination of heparin injections, <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). First, to investigate <italic>WntA</italic> signalling, we injected heparin into early <italic>Limenitis</italic> pupae of a white-banded progeny. Heparin binds Wnt family ligands in a wide range of organisms, promoting their transport through the extracellular matrix of developing tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, and, in this case, resulted in a fully melanized adult wing pattern lacking the white band, similar to the mimetic form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). These results, reminiscent of previous heparin injections in other butterfly species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, suggest a role for heparin-sensitive signals such as Wnt molecules in patterning the medial region of the butterfly wing. Next, we examined <italic>WntA</italic> expression in 5th larval instar wing discs and found that <italic>WntA</italic> mRNA expression forms an elongated antero-posterior expression domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>) outside of the white band delineating the contour of its proximal boundary. This spatial correlation, observed in both forewings and hindwings, as well as across all observed stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), suggests that <italic>WntA</italic> has a role in the early developmental specification of the white band. Despite this, we found identical spatial patterns of <italic>WntA</italic> expression in both the mimetic and the non-mimetic forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). This result was surprising because spatial modulation of <italic>WntA</italic> mRNA expression is directly perceptible in the larval wing discs of <italic>Heliconius</italic>, and larval <italic>WntA</italic> expression domains perfectly mirror patterns of phenotypic variation on the adult wing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>; ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Therefore, to investigate whether an alternative mechanism operates in <italic>Limenitis</italic>, we then performed RNAseq analysis of <italic>WntA</italic> expression across four developmental time points (5th instar, prepupal, &#x0003c;48 post pupation and &#x0003e;48 post pupation), and found highly significant evidence for upregulated expression of a 5&#x02032;-untranslated region (UTR), during the 5th instar stage, only among mimetic individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>; general linear model (GLM): <italic>n</italic>=6, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001 after false discovery rate (FDR) correction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Consistent with our <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization results, we also found that no other <italic>WntA</italic> exons were differentially expressed in <italic>Limenitis</italic> at any developmental time point examined.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Population genomics</title><p>Next, to characterize patterns of nucleotide variation across the colour-patterning region in <italic>Limenitis</italic>, we generated a single, contiguous reference scaffold by sequencing bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones spanning our zero-recombinant interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Subsequent sequencing and analysis of 30 full <italic>Limenitis</italic> genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), including both parents of the mapping brood, aligned to our BAC reference, identified a 30-kb segregating haplotype, consisting of 173 fixed single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in complete linkage disequilibrium (LD), located 23&#x02009;kb upstream of the 5&#x02032; coding region of <italic>WntA</italic>, which predicts phenotype across all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). To verify this result, we genotyped an additional 120 butterflies across a transect of the phenotypic hybrid zone between these two wing pattern races, and, again, found a perfect correspondence between genotype and phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Importantly, genome-wide patterns of molecular variation revealed no evidence of geographic population structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 5 and 6</xref>; and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 3 and 4</xref>), and no other portion of the genome showed an association with phenotype. In addition, because we found no overlap between associated SNPs and the <italic>WntA</italic> exons, these results rule out coding mutations as a possible molecular switch controlling the presence/absence of white bands in <italic>Limenitis</italic>. Finally, to investigate the mechanism maintaining extended LD upstream of <italic>WntA</italic>, we analysed patterns of structural variation, and found evidence for a single 9-kb-long interspersed element (LINE) retrotransposon, situated near the centre of the mimetic haplotype but absent in the non-mimetic allele, that occurs in the 60-kb-long first intron of <italic>WntA</italic> that was also perfectly associated with phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>, vertical blue bar, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). LINE elements can suppress recombination via the insertion of a non-homologous and non-collinear sequences, as well as by altering local DNA methylation patterns<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, and, therefore, may be responsible for maintaining LD across the large (30&#x02009;kb) haplotypes we found.</p><p>Taken together, our results suggest that differential expression of a <italic>WntA</italic> 5&#x02032;-UTR sequence during late larval development underlies adaptive phenotypic divergence between mimetic and non-mimetic <italic>Limenitis</italic>. At the molecular level, differential expression of the 5&#x02032;-UTR may have arisen either directly (by interfering with gene function) or indirectly (by facilitating the accumulation of cis-regulatory mutations) from a LINE insertion in the first intron of <italic>WntA</italic>. Alternatively, the extensive LD we observed may instead reflect strong natural selection on multiple cis-regulatory SNPs interspersed across the haplotype interval. Under either scenario, differential expression of the 5&#x02032;-UTR is a reasonable proximate mechanism given that such sequences regulate many aspects of protein translation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, and, in this case, the differentially expressed <italic>WntA</italic> 5&#x02032;-UTR contains a predicted internal ribosome entry site (IRES) motif that could mediate such effects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). This latter observation suggests that a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism may act as the molecular switch in <italic>Limenitis</italic>, controlling the presence/absence of white bands.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Comparative genomics of colour pattern evolution</title><p>While these results provide unique insights into the molecular basis of adaptation, our primary goal was to identify and compare the proximate basis of melanin pattern formation in <italic>Limenitis</italic> and <italic>Heliconius</italic>. To do this, we first focused on two closely related species in Costa Rica, <italic>H. cydno galanthus</italic> (<italic>n</italic>=10) and <italic>H. pachinus</italic> (<italic>n</italic>=10), which vary markedly in their M&#x000fc;llerian mimicry phenotypes as a result of allelic variation at <italic>Ac</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>); <italic>H. pachinus</italic> has a melanized patch of scales, which is lacking in <italic>H. c. galanthus</italic>. Examination of SNPs across the 581-kb <italic>Ac</italic> scaffold from the published <italic>Heliconius</italic> genome sequence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> identified 170 SNPs and a 1.8-kb indel fixed between these two species, all of which occur upstream of the <italic>WntA</italic> coding region. To refine the phenotypic association, we then analysed an additional 25 genomes from a single phenotypically variable population of <italic>H. c. alithea</italic> in Ecuador, in which similar <italic>Ac</italic> phenotypes segregate as a polymorphism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). This analysis ruled out all SNPs and revealed a single structural variant, the 1.8-kb indel, that is perfectly associated with forewing pattern shape in <italic>Heliconius</italic> from Costa Rica and Ecuador (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). In fact, the <italic>Ac</italic> locus was previously mapped to <italic>WntA</italic> in laboratory crosses, and pure-bred stocks of each Ecuadorian morph show discrete differences in <italic>WntA</italic> expression that explain their pattern differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Collectively, these results strongly suggest that structural variation upstream of <italic>WntA</italic> contributes directly to <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory divergence among morphs of <italic>H. c. alithea</italic>. Finally, alignment of the <italic>WntA</italic> interval from <italic>Heliconius</italic> and <italic>Limenitis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b,c</xref>) revealed that the mutational variants overlap in both systems, supporting the hypothesis that phenotypic convergence originated as a consequence of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations influencing developmental patterns of gene expression in the same gene, <italic>WntA</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Convergent phenotypic evolution among distinct evolutionary lineages is generally considered evidence for adaptation, thereby illustrating the power of natural selection to shape patterns of morphological evolution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. In contrast, convergence at the molecular level is often viewed as a consequence of generative constraints, with certain genetic or developmental architectures limiting the functional mechanisms available in the production of novel morphologies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. With the maturation of the genomic age comes the ability to examine the molecular basis of phenotypic evolution at multiple functional levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> and in multiple biological systems.

Although additional functional work is needed to evaluate the regulatory consequences of these mutations, the discovery of parallel genetic evolution of <italic>WntA</italic> is remarkable (1) because it was identified in two independent mapping studies without initial bias on the genetic basis of the trait (2) owing to the exceptionally large divergence times (<italic>ca</italic>. 65 MY) between <italic>Heliconius</italic> and <italic>Limenitis</italic>, and (3) because, unlike melanin pathway genes that have also been repeatedly linked to pigment variation, <italic>WntA</italic> is a regulatory gene involved in the early deployment of spatial information in undifferentiated tissues (for example, embryos<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> and wing discs). Surprisingly, our results suggest that modulation of this conserved developmental gene has occurred in tandem between these two deeply divergent butterfly lineages, implying an unexpected and remarkable level of predictability in the evolutionary process.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Positional cloning</title><p>All <italic>Limenitis</italic> specimens utilized for genetic linkage mapping were collected from a single locality in Pennsylvania (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Wild-captured, mated female specimens were captured and fed a mixture of honey and water twice daily, and were secured on <italic>Prunus serotina</italic> and/or <italic>Salyx babylonica</italic> to encourage oviposition. Larvae were raised directly on host plants with one brood per enclosure. Pupae were collected and placed in labelled containers to prevent adults from mating upon emergence. Adult butterflies were transferred to envelopes numbered with their sibling group and according to their order of emergence. Adults were then photographed and crossed via hand-pairing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Mapping families were generated via backcrossing heterozygous mimetic males to fully banded, non-mimetic females (homozygous recessive at the major gene controlling mimicry), as linkage maps constructed with heterozygous females are uninformative because there is no recombination during oogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Following mating, the wings and tissues of male butterflies were immediately archived, and the wings and tissues of female butterflies were archived when oviposition was ceased.

All progeny from mapping crosses displayed either the mimetic phenotype (heterozygous with dominant modifier) or the white-banded (homozygous) phenotype. We scored wing patterns of the resulting 111 progeny of the mapping family based on the presence or absence of hindwing and forewing medial white banding. Forty-five were mimetic (23 males and 22 females) and 66 were fully banded (30 males and 36 females; <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup>=3.973, two-tailed <italic>P</italic> value=0.046). Although these values differ weakly from our statistical expectations, the results of numerous other crosses carried out by SPM over the last 10 years support a model of Mendelian inheritance.</p><p>Wings were removed from each butterfly, photographed and archived in glassine envelopes. Remaining whole bodies were placed inside 1.5&#x02009;ml microcentrifuge tubes with 100% ethanol to preserve the genomic DNA. Wing muscle tissue was dissected from each archived butterflies, and DNA extractions were performed using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Inc.). Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) genotypes were generated using the AFLP Plant Mapping kit for small plant genomes (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. In brief, fragments were generated using restriction enzymes EcoRI and MseI. Next, fragments were ligated to adaptors and selectively amplified during two separate rounds of PCR. Once the PCRs was completed, reactions for each fragment were spiked with an internal lane size standard to ensure proper size matching of AFLP across samples. Fragment analysis was performed on an 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Applied BioSystems, Inc.). AFLP electropherograms were analysed in Applied Biosystem&#x02019;s GeneMapper software, version 3.7 (Applied Biosystems, Inc.), with AFLP alleles scored as either present or absent and according to fragment size. Peak height threshold was set to 80 RFU. Fragments smaller than 50 base pairs and larger than 550 base pairs were excluded from analysis. The parents and progeny (<italic>n</italic>=111) were then genotyped for 60 unique AFLP primer pair combinations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> analysed separately in GeneMapper, version 3.7 (Applied Biosystems, Inc.), and any marker that had a large number of missing genotypes was removed from the data set. Of the resulting 2,571 AFLP, 506 (19.7%) were diagnostic, mappable markers (present in the male, absent in the female and segregating in the progeny in a near 1:1 pattern).</p><p>AFLP marker order and position were estimated using JoinMap 3.0 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>), which used <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup>-tests for segregation distortion and tests of independence to filter spurious genotypes. Log likelihood ratio scores above 3.0 for markers are considered significant evidence for linkage (95% probability). Markers were separated into linkage groups and are selected for mapping at a minimum log likelihood ratio score of 4.0. Final map distances were corrected using Kosambi&#x02019;s mapping function; this function is designed to account for the observation that larger chromosomes are more likely to have double crossovers than small chromosomes and results in shorter, more accurate linkage maps compared with those maps using Haldane&#x02019;s mapping function that assumes complete interference<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Mapping of the diagnostic markers resulted in 30 linkage groups, varying in length from 46 to 107&#x02009;cM, and in agreement with chromosomal number estimates for this species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. The total map length was 2,250&#x02009;cM with an average distance of 4.5&#x02009;cM between AFLP markers. Given the genome size estimate for <italic>Limenitis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref> of 388&#x02009;Mb (+/&#x02212; 7&#x02009;Mb for females and 4&#x02009;Mb for males), each cM in our map represents ~160.4&#x02009;kb.</p><p>Direct comparisons among linkage maps based on dominant markers, such as AFLPs, are not possible. Therefore, we generated diagnostic SNP markers from highly conserved nuclear genes by designing <italic>Limenitis</italic>-specific primers from annotated expressed sequence tags (ESTs) developed via 454 pyrosequencing of 48&#x02009;h pupal wing disc cDNA, and genotyped the entire backcross mapping brood for each SNP by Sanger sequencing to facilitate comparisons with other published Lepidopteran genetic maps, with an emphasis on <italic>Heliconius</italic>.

The average linkage group was 74.9&#x02009;cM. Both the total map length and the average linkage group length remained nearly the identical to the dominant marker map. However, the addition of 57 new SNPs reduced the average distance between markers from 4.44 to 3.99&#x02009;cM, an estimated 6,000&#x02009;bp difference per cM.
