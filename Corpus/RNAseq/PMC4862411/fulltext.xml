Median survival is only 9 months, and 5-year survival is less than 1%<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Historically, DIPG research has been limited by a dearth of tumor tissue available for study and lack of experimental model systems. Recently, patient-derived DIPG cell cultures and orthotopic xenograft models have been established<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Genomic studies identified recurrent K27M mutations in genes encoding histone H3<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, resulting in inhibition of the Polycomb Repressive Complex-2 (PCR2) methyltransferase and global hypomethylation of H3K27<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Armed with these important insights and new tools to design clinical trials based on preclinical data, an international collaboration has formed to pool DIPG tissue resources and evaluate functional targets for DIPG therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><p id="P7">We assembled a panel of 14 patient-derived DIPG cell cultures, representing neurosphere and adherent models, obtained from both biopsy or autopsy samples (methods and <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>), representing the breadth of DIPG cell cultures available worldwide at the initiation of the study. Two additional cell cultures (methods and <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>) were subsequently added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Clinical, histopathological and molecular characteristics of the cultures are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Tables 1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">2</xref>. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) of culture models used for drug screening when primary tumor DNA was available (WES for 7/9 of tumors not previously reported<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> are described here); additional DIPG tumors not associated with cultures (<italic>n</italic> = 15) were also sequenced to add to publically available DIPG genomic data (<italic>n</italic> = 22 DIPG tumors with WES data; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Using this DIPG culture panel, we screened 83 drugs selected by pediatric neurooncologists as promising small molecule compounds or traditional chemotherapeutic agents.

We found sensitivity to a limited number of drugs (14/83 compounds demonstrated activity against 3 or more DIPG cultures; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The chemical screen and subsequent validation experiments revealed DIPG cell sensitivity to histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, as well as a limited number of other agents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a&#x02013;c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Notable &#x0201c;misses&#x0201d; that highlight the resistance of this tumor to traditional chemotherapies include temozolomide, carboplatin and vincristine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To examine the molecular context of functional drug screening results, RNA deep sequencing (RNAseq) was performed to analyze expression in primary DIPG tumors versus normal, paired cerebral cortex tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Screening and RNAseq data were then used in an integrative predictive modeling approach to tumor drug sensitivity using Target Inhibitor Maps (TIMs)<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>; the DIPG TIM predictions and <italic>in vitro</italic> validations are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 4</xref>.</p><p id="P10">The multi-HDAC inhibitor panobinostat<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, among the most effective agents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), was selected for further exploration. In all, 12/16 DIPG cultures demonstrated sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Compared to vorinostat, panobinostat illustrated substantially greater potency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Testing cell viability at 24, 48 and 72 hours at various dose levels of panobinostat demonstrated decreased viability by 48 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Expression of proliferation-associated genes <italic>MKI67</italic> and <italic>CCND1</italic> decreased with time after panobinostat exposure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). FACS analysis of EdU incorporation and Annexin V staining illustrated dose-dependent decreased cell proliferation and increased cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>). shRNA-mediated knock-down of <italic>HDAC1</italic> or <italic>HDAC2</italic> decreased cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6c &#x02013; e</xref>). Western blot analyses demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in H3 acetylation and H3K27-trimethylation following panobinostat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>), suggesting partial rescue of the H3K27M-induced global hypotrimethylation phenotype. Increased K27 trimethylation is an unexpected effect of the drug, but is consistent with recent findings that acetylated H3K27 can &#x0201c;detoxify&#x0201d; K27M-induced inhibition of PCR2<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. RNAseq performed on panobinostat- or vehicle-treated DIPG cells revealed sweeping changes in gene expression, including normalization of the K27M gene expression signature<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and decrease in the oncogenic MYC target gene signature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">8</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We next used convection-enhanced delivery (CED)<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> to directly infuse panobinostat into the pons of a DIPG orthotopic xenograft model engineered to express firefly luciferase (SU-DIPG-VI-luc; H3.3K27M subtype). <italic>In vivo</italic> bioluminescent imaging was performed immediately prior to and 7 days after panobinostat (or vehicle control) to assess tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d &#x02013; g</xref>). We confirmed that panobinostat does not down-regulate the luciferase transgene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9a</xref>). A marked effect of panobinostat on the rate of DIPG xenograft growth was observed: vehicle-treated control mice exhibited xenograft growth &#x0223c;6.5 fold greater than mice treated with a single dose of panobinostat by CED (<italic>n</italic> = 4 vehicle controls, 5 treated mice; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 by two-tailed t test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9b</xref>). We next investigated pontine penetration of panobinostat following systemic administration using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Following a single 20 mg/kg IP dose, pontine panobinostat levels were 0.068 ng/mg, or &#x0223c;200 nM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). As the DIPG IC<sub>50</sub> for panobinostat was found to be &#x0223c;100 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), we reasoned that systemic delivery may prove effective. Mice with SU-DIPG-VI-luc orthotopic xenografts were treated with 1, 10 or 20 mg/kg IP panobinostat. At one week, a significant reduction in tumor growth in panobinostat-treated animals in 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg treatment groups occurred compared to vehicle-treated controls (<italic>n</italic> = 5 per group and 7 per group; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 and 0.01 by two-tailed t test, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>). At 4 weeks, tumor growth was reduced only in the 20 mg/kg group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9c</xref>). We tested a second patient-derived DIPG brainstem orthotopic xenograft model (LI-F; H3WT subtype) using an alternative panobinostat dose schedule (10 mg/kg IP, 5 days on, 5 days off). Mice treated with panobinostat exhibited significantly prolonged survival compared to vehicle-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i</xref>, <italic>n</italic> = 10 per group, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 by log-rank analysis).</p><p id="P12">Highlighting the need for effective combination therapies, DIPG cells that survive chronic panobinostat exposure demonstrated resistance when re-challenged with the drug (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10a</xref>). As a recent elegant study demonstrated utility of the histone demethylase inhibitor GSKJ4<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, we tested GSKJ4 alone or in combination with panobinostat.

In addition, we considered the distribution of copy number estimates for each gene&#x02019;s individual exons. If the mean exonic copy number showed a gain or loss of at least 30% and deviated from the null hypothesis by at least 2.5 standard deviations, we called the gene as gained or lost.</p><p id="P55">For the total copy-number call over all tumor tissue samples, we counted each gain or loss of at least 60% as +/&#x02212;2 on its respective segment, and each gain or loss of 30&#x02013;60% as +/&#x02212;1, and summed these contributions across all tumor tissue samples. In order to omit germline CNVs from the total, we looked at segmented exon coverage ratios between the individual normal samples and the normal pool. Any segment that was gained or lost by 30% in at least two normal samples was flagged as a probable CNV, and was not included in the total copy-number sum.</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>Generation of RNAseq libraries</title><p id="P56">RNAseq libraries for transcriptome analysis were prepared using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) and Agilent Automation NGS system per manufacturers&#x02019; instructions. Sample prep began with 1 &#x000b5;g of total RNA from each sample. Poly-A RNA was purified from the sample with oligo dT magnetic beads, and the poly(A) RNA was fragmented with divalent cations. Fragmented poly-A RNA was converted into cDNA through reverse transcription and were repaired using T4 DNA polymerase, Klenow polymerase, and T4 polynucleotide kinase. 3&#x02019; A-tailing with exo-minus Klenow polymerase was followed by ligation of Illumina paired-end oligo adapters to the cDNA fragment. Ligated DNA was PCR amplified for 15 cycles and purified using AMPure XP beads. After purification of the PCR products with AMPure XP beads, the quality and quantity of the resulting transcriptome libraries were analyzed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity chip.</p></sec><sec id="S32"><title>Gene expression in RPKM inferred from RNAseq data</title><p id="P57">All transcriptome libraries were sequenced with the Illumina HiSeq in paired end mode. The reads that passed the chastity filter of Illumina BaseCall software were used for subsequent analysis.

Two samples are deemed a match if at least 85% of the positions with sufficient coverage in both samples have identical fingerprints. In practice, samples from the same patient match at greater than or equal to 90% of positions, while samples from different patients match at less than or equal to 75% of positions. For this study, all the included samples from the same patient met the greater than or equal to 85% match criteria, including all RNAseq and exome samples.

The Drug target inhibition information is contained in a matrix &#x00394; which quantifies the ability of a drug to inhibit its kinase targets. Each row vector is relatively sparse, as most drugs inhibit a select few primary targets and a small set of secondary, but often relevant, side targets. Each entry of &#x00394; is a real number between 0 and 1 denoting the inhibition of the kinase target. An entry of &#x00394; is close to 1 when a small concentration of a drug can phosphorylate 50% of the kinase target. The matrix &#x00394; is generated based on published drug target Kd&#x02019;s or EC50&#x02019;s from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link> and related publications. We used a hill curve interpolation with hill coefficient of 1 and drug concentration of 10,000nM to convert the EC50&#x02019;s to normalized inhibitions between 0 and 1. For each drug tested over a cell line, the functional response is measured as cell viability, the percentage of living cancerous cells following 72 hr application of a drug. The cellular death rate for each drug, considered as the percentage of cancerous cells killed following 72 hr application of the drug, is simply (1 - cell viability). The cellular death rate values are tested with 3 replicates in 4 concentrations. The cellular death rate values are converted to IC50&#x02019;s via hill curve interpolation. The IC50 values are then converted to sensitivities between 0 and 1 using a hill curve with hill coefficient of 1 and drug concentration of 10,000nM. A NaN or NA IC50 is converted to sensitivity 0. This set of sensitivities is a matrix denoted by &#x003a3;. Note that we have a matrix &#x003a3; of size 60&#x000d7;8 for drug screen 1 and a matrix &#x003a3; of size 60&#x000d7;7 for drug screen 2.</p><p id="P66">To incorporate the mutation characterization, we consider the set of kinase targets present in the drug screen (denoted by &#x00472;<sub>1</sub>) and created a binary matrix M<sub>0</sub> which denotes whether each of the drug target is mutated or not for each cell line. Considering the common 404 targets of the two drug screens, the size of M<sub>0</sub> is 15&#x000d7;404 where 15 denotes the cell lines (two rows are repeated as there are unique 10 cell lines).</p><p id="P67">To incorporate RNA expression data generated from the RNAseq experiments, we consider the set of kinase targets present in the drug screen (denoted &#x00472;<sub>1</sub>) and the targets with quantified expression present in the RNAseq data (denoted &#x00472;<sub>2</sub>). The set of targets for which we have usable information is then &#x00472;<sub>1</sub>&#x02229;&#x00472;<sub>2</sub>, the intersection of the two target sets. The remaining targets in &#x00472;<sub>1</sub> are targets for which we do not have any RNA expression information and thus we are only able to gain information on these kinase targets from the drug screen data. Let the RNA expression be given by matrix G<sub>0</sub>. In this analysis, the set &#x00472;<sub>1</sub>&#x02229;&#x00472;<sub>2</sub> has 403 targets and thus the size of G<sub>0</sub> is 15 &#x000d7; 403. The RNA expression matrix is converted to a normalized matrix G by dividing the RNA expression of each gene by the mean expression of the matched normal samples or mean expression values.

We next provide a brief outline of the approach (for details, please refer to <sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>). The primary goal of the TIM model is to generate hypotheses of set of targets that can potentially produce desirable treatment results based on the available drug screen and gene expression data. There are two main steps in the TIM method: step one is selection of the optimal drug targets based on functional data generated from drug screens. This is the model generation step in the TIM algorithm. The model generation is approached from a Boolean logic perspective, where we aim to generate logical relationships between targets that identify the mechanisms by which tumors persist. Due to the Boolean nature of the approach, the matrix &#x00394; generated for this analysis consists of 0&#x02019;s or 1&#x02019;s. The drug inhibition profiles (in the form of target EC<sub>50</sub>&#x02019;s) are used to generate the binarized inhibition vectors based on the drug&#x02019;s IC50 value. The binarized vectors are generated based on the following equation: <italic>a log</italic> (<italic>IC</italic><sub>50</sub>) &#x02264; <italic>log</italic> (<italic>EC</italic><sub>50</sub>) &#x02264; <italic>b log</italic> (<italic>IC</italic><sub>50</sub>), 0 &#x02264; <italic>a</italic> &#x0226a; <italic>b</italic> This binarization approach uses the functional drug sensitivity data to generate vectors of relevant drug targets. We assume that any target sufficiently beyond the IC<sub>50</sub> point is unlikely to have been the cause of the drug response, and thus we assume that we cannot gain information from it.</p><p id="P69">To generate drug sensitivity values from the IC<sub>50</sub> response data, we use the following equation: <inline-formula><mml:math id="M1" overflow="scroll"><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>log</mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mtext mathvariant="italic">MaxDose</mml:mtext><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:mtext>log</mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>50</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>log</mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mtext mathvariant="italic">MaxDose</mml:mtext><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></inline-formula> where <italic>IC</italic><sub>50,<italic>i</italic></sub> is the IC<sub>50,i</sub> of drug i, <italic>MaxDose<sub>i</sub></italic> is the maximum tested dosage of drug i, and <italic>y<sub>i</sub></italic> is the resulting sensitivity value of drug i.</p><p id="P70">To incorporate RNAseq data into the TIM analysis, we eliminate unlikely kinase targets from consideration based on G, the matrix of normalized RNA expressions over the set &#x00472;<sub>1</sub>&#x02229;&#x00472;<sub>2</sub>. A kinase target is kept in the dataset for consideration if G(i,j) &#x0003e; &#x003c1;, a threshold for minimum relative expression. Note that we are considering expressed targets only as the effect of a molecularly-targeted drug is to inhibit the target when it is expressed and thus, non-expressed drug targets will have limited effect on predicting the drug response. For the purpose of this project, the RNA expressions constraint was G(i,j) &#x0003e; &#x003c1; = 1 meaning the RNA expression of the cancerous line must be at least that of the matched normal expression. As G does not provide information about the remaining targets in &#x00472;<sub>1</sub> &#x02212; &#x00472;<sub>2</sub>, they are not eliminated from consideration as they could potentially be driver mechanisms for the tumor.

Here, the &#x0227c;,&#x0227d; operators signify component-wise inequality in all components.</p><p id="P75">The vectors and associated sensitivity values from matrix &#x003a3; are used to select the optimal targets for the TIM model. The optimal targets are selected by solving the following optimization problem that incorporates the inter-bin error (the error associated with multiple drugs having the same inhibition profile but differences in their sensitivity values) and the inconsistency error (the error associated with drug A being less effective than drug B but the targets of drug B are a subset of the drug A&#x02019;s targets). In this context, a bin is any subset of a set of kinase targets selected to build the model.

The inter-bin error amounts to ensuring that kinase inhibitors with similar inhibition profiles with respect to the model have similar experimental sensitivities, indicating the likely mechanisms have been identified. The inconsistency error incorporates the subset-superset biological constraint introduced previously and is given by the following equation: &#x02211;<sub><italic>drugs</italic></sub>&#x02211;<sub><italic>bins</italic></sub>&#x003c7;(<italic>bin, drug</italic>)|<italic>P</italic>(<italic>s<sub>j</sub></italic>|<italic>T</italic>)|-<italic>Y</italic>(<italic>s<sub>j</sub></italic>|<italic>T</italic>)|, where <italic>P(&#x02022;)</italic> and <italic>Y(&#x02022;)</italic> are as above and <italic>X(&#x02022;)</italic> is an indicator function which is 1 when the subset-superset constraint is violated.

We find the minimum solution to the optimization problem using a suboptimal search algorithm known as Sequential Floating Forward Search (SFFS). The TIM framework requires that the subset-superset biological constraints are satisfied during model generation. This allows for identification of unique target combinations that may not be identified as relevant through a standard linear modeling approach.</p><p id="P76">Step two in TIM analysis is sensitivity prediction based on selected targets from step one. This step is used to generate the TIM circuit, which provides a visual representation of effective treatments inferred from the functional data. To generate the target blocks, viable target combinations are explored systematically in a breadth-first search style approach. Here, desired sensitivity levels for each level of inhibition (in terms of targets inhibited) is specified by the user; based on this specification, combinations of targets that satisfy the desired sensitivity levels are selected and no further supersets of the combination are considered. The inferential steps are based on bounding the expected sensitivity by the closest subset of the target combination and the closest superset of the target combination.
