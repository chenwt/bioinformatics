Despite significant research effort, the pathophysiology of this important extrapulmonary manifestation is still unclear. A key question that remains unanswered is to what extent systemic inflammatory mediators might play a role in this pathology.</p><p>Cigarette smoke (CS) is the main risk factor for developing COPD and therefore animal models chronically exposed to CS have been proposed for mechanistic studies and biomarker discovery. Although mice have been successfully used as a pre-clinical <italic>in vivo</italic> model to study the pulmonary effects of acute and chronic CS exposure, data suggest that they may be inadequate models for studying the effects of CS on peripheral muscle function. In contrast, recent findings indicate that the guinea pig model (<italic>Cavia porcellus</italic>) may better mimic muscle wasting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We have used a systems biology approach to compare the transcriptional profile of hindlimb skeletal muscles from a Guinea pig rodent model exposed to CS and/or chronic hypoxia to COPD patients with muscle wasting.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We show that guinea pigs exposed to long-term CS accurately reflect most of the transcriptional changes observed in dysfunctional limb muscle of severe COPD patients when compared to matched controls. Using network inference, we could then show that the expression profile in whole lung of genes encoding for soluble inflammatory mediators is informative of the molecular state of skeletal muscles in the guinea pig smoking model. Finally, we show that CXCL10 and CXCL9, two of the candidate systemic cytokines identified using this pre-clinical model, are indeed detected at significantly higher levels in serum of COPD patients, and that their serum protein level is inversely correlated with the expression of aerobic energy metabolism genes in skeletal muscle.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We conclude that CXCL10 and CXCL9 are promising candidate inflammatory signals linked to the regulation of central metabolism genes in skeletal muscles. On a methodological level, our work also shows that a system level analysis of animal models of diseases can be very effective to generate clinically relevant hypothesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13073-014-0059-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), one of the top five deadliest diseases worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], is an inflammatory condition of the lungs that predominantly affects people with a long history of cigarette smoking (CS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition to the clinical manifestations in the lung, COPD is also associated with several extra pulmonary manifestations. Skeletal muscle wasting and dysfunction is one of the most severe of these pathologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This muscular deconditioning, which is partly independent of the severity of airflow limitation, is a prominent contributor to exercise intolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] as well as being an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Long-term CS exposure has a clear potential to contribute to the systemic effects of COPD, as similar findings have been observed in healthy smokers (for example, a decrease in lean muscle mass and force reduction) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, the direct effects of CS on peripheral muscle function, at the molecular level, are poorly understood.</p><p>Although we do not still fully understand the mechanisms that contribute to muscle dysfunction in COPD, there is evidence that multiple factors are likely to influence clinical outcome, such as systemic inflammation, reduced capillary density, tissue hypoxia and subsequent oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, it is not known to what extent increased levels of inflammatory cytokines play a role in muscle wasting. Likewise, hypoxaemia has been linked to several drivers of muscle dysfunction in COPD such as downregulation of energy-consuming processes (for example, protein synthesis, mitochondrial respiration), impaired myogenesis, fibre type shifting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and increased serum levels of cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], but the exact molecular mechanisms through which chronic or intermitted hypoxia affects muscle maintenance are unclear.</p><p>Animal models, particularly mouse models, are widely used to study the effects of acute and chronic CS. Importantly, long-term CS exposure in rodent models may be the best approximation of the more acute aspects of lung responses in human COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, the current literature suggests that mice chronically exposed to CS develop either none or only mild peripheral muscle dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. For example, only two studies have to our knowledge reported a significant decrease in hindlimb muscle weight following long-term whole-body exposure using very high smoking doses (&#x02265;20 cigarettes/day) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The guinea pig (<italic>Cavia porcellus</italic>), one of the most popular animal models to study infectious diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], has been shown to tolerate CS exposure without the rapid weight loss observed in other pre-clinical models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, promisingly long-term CS-exposed guinea pigs fail to appropriately gain body weight compared to age-matched sham controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Further, in accordance with previous findings in COPD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], guinea pigs demonstrate CS-induced oxidative stress in limb muscles within 3&#x000a0;months of exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], potentially highlighting the relevance of the guinea pig model for studying extrapulmonary co-morbidities that characterise human COPD.</p><p>However, the guinea pig is a rather challenging model organism to determine the molecular response due to the lack of a fully annotated genome. This paucity of genetic information is unfortunate since gene expression profiling has shown to be a very promising approach to formulate hypotheses on complex molecular mechanisms underlying pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Here, we report the development of the first transcriptome-sequencing for guinea pigs representing lung and skeletal muscles, as well as the development and validation of a novel genome-wide microarray platform. With this novel platform, we profiled the transcriptional response of lung and muscle tissues chronically exposed to CS, hypoxia (CH) or to combined stimuli (CSCH). The overarching aim of our study was to assess whether guinea pig hindlimb muscles (both oxidative and glycolytic) show a transcriptional response to these exposures, and whether such gene signatures can be correlated to the expression of lung secreted proteins.</p><p>We discovered that indeed skeletal muscles of guinea pigs exposed to all experimental interventions accurately mimic the transcriptional state of human limb muscle sampled from COPD patients with muscle atrophy. Using a relatively simple network inference method we then identified systemic cytokines whose mRNA and serum protein levels are inversely correlated with the transcriptional state of energy metabolism pathways in guinea pig and human COPD patients, respectively.</p><p>These results provide further evidence for the utility of the guinea pig smoking model to study muscle wasting in COPD and support the hypothesis that systemic inflammation plays an important role in altering the energy metabolic state in peripheral muscles causing them to dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Guinea pig smoking model</title><p>Sixteen male Hartley guinea pigs were divided into four groups: one group was exposed to CS for 3&#x000a0;months (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4); a second group was kept in normoxia for 10&#x000a0;weeks and subsequently placed in an hypoxic environment (12% O<sub>2</sub>) for 2&#x000a0;weeks (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4); a third group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) was CS-exposed for 3&#x000a0;months and to chronic hypoxia the last 2 smoking weeks; finally we included a fourth group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) of sham controls remaining in normoxia for the whole study period. To avoid problems related to ageing, young adults were used (8&#x000a0;weeks of age), and to avoid scaling effects body mass was similar (approximately 300&#x000a0;g/animal). All procedures involving animals and their care were approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Barcelona and by the University of Valladolid Institutional Committee for Animal Care and Use, and were conducted following institutional guidelines that comply with national (Generalitat de Catalunya decree 214/1997, DOGC 2450) and international (Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, National Institutes of Health, 85-23, 1985) laws and policies.</p><p>Whole lung as well as soleus and lateral gastrocnemius hindlimb muscles were isolated from each animal at the end of the study period. The soleus muscle and the lateral gastro were selected to represent oxidative and glycolytic muscles, respectively. It should be noted that although the gastrocnemius as a whole is a mixed muscle, the lateral portion is predominantly glycolytic.</p><p>Animals receiving CS were daily exposed to the smoke of four cigarettes (2R4F; Kentucky University Research; Lexington, KY, USA, 11&#x000a0;mg tar, 0.8&#x000a0;mg nicotine per cigarette), 5&#x000a0;days/week using a nose-only inhalation system (Protowerx Design Inc; Langley, BC, Canada). Sham-exposure to CS was done daily by placing control animals in the nose-only exposure chamber for the same duration (1&#x000a0;h) without cigarettes being lighted. In this experimental model, neither nutritional status (determined via measurements of plasma cholesterol, protein and lipids) nor whole-body weight gain at the end of the study period is significantly different between CS-exposed and sham animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Moreover, no changes in the proportion of Type I and Type II fibres can be detected between CS-exposed and shams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Detailed information on exposure protocols, pulmonary function data and histological assessments from this study, which demonstrate that observations in lung function and pulmonary structural changes of COPD patients are indeed replicated in the CS-exposed guinea pigs, have been reported in two separate publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>RNA isolation from guinea pig samples</title><p>Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini extraction kits (Qiagen, USA) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations. RNA purity and quality was evaluated using a NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific) and a BioAnalyzer 2100 instrument (Agilent Technologies), respectively. All samples had a RIN score &#x0003e;7.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Definition of the guinea pig transcriptome by mRNA sequencing and microarray design</title><p>In 2008 the guinea pig genome was sequenced to a depth of approximately 7X full coverage, and last updated in 2010. However, because of the lack of cDNA and protein resources the guinea pig genome is at present poorly annotated. Thus, in order to address this issue we performed an in-depth mRNA sequencing of the lung and skeletal muscles transcriptomes and used this to annotate the available guinea pig genome for transcribed sequences. We then used this information to design and validate the custom Agilent microarray platform used in this study.</p><p>Transcriptome sequencing was performed using Illumina sequencing. Briefly, NCBI and Ensembl transcripts of guinea pig were combined with transcripts constructed from Illumina paired end reads using the TopHat and Cufflinks algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Microarray probe sequences were then chosen based on the combined transcriptome assembly. The raw RNAseq data have been deposited at the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under the reference number GSE56099. A full description of the procedure is provided in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Guinea pig microarray gene expression profiling</title><p>One hundred nanograms of total RNA from each sample was amplified and converted into labelled cRNA using Agilent&#x02019;s Low Input Quick Amp Labelling Kit according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations. Cy3-labelled cRNA (600&#x000a0;ng/sample) was hybridised to our custom <italic>Cavia porcellus</italic> oligonucleotide microarray (manufactured by Agilent) in randomised sample order, which generated 61,657 measures per sample (18,073 annotated genes). Hybridisation, washing and scanning of arrays were performed according to manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. Three samples (one from each tissue) were lost during the process of generating raw data. All scanned microarrays passed all 11 of the Agilent&#x02019;s quality metrics. Capture probes that were flagged (that is, did not pass Agilent&#x02019;s &#x02018;well above background&#x02019; condition) on at least 80% of the chips were removed prior to data analysis, such that only those capture probes with a raw signal greater than 99% of the background population signal, for at least 20% of the samples, were retained (29,333 probes were discarded).</p><p>Raw microarray data were then normalised against sham controls for each of the three tissues using loess in the &#x02018;marray&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and &#x02018;limma&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] Bioconductor packages. Arrays were examined using hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) to identify outliers prior to statistical analysis.</p><p>The statistical significance of differential expression of each gene was determined using the significance analysis of microarray (SAM) algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] with a false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of 1%. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment in differentially expressed genes was examined using the web-based tool DAVID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Disease KEGG pathways were excluded from the analysis to maximise biological interpretability. Therefore the analysis was restricted to KEGG group 1-4 (Metabolism, Genetic Information Processing, Environmental Information Processing and Cellular Processes). The microarray data have been deposited in GEO under accession number GSE56099.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>RT-qPCR validation of custom guinea pig array</title><p>Reverse transcription of 1 ug of isolated total RNA from whole-lung tissue (same RNA as were used for the microarray part) was performed using the Tetro cDNA synthesis kit (Bioline) with random hexamer primers following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. The resulting cDNA was diluted 10-fold and 2.5 uL of this was used to perform qPCR in triplicate (25 uL reaction mixture volume) using the Maxima SYBR green (Thermo Scientific) and 300 nM of primers according the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. To adjust for variations in the cDNA synthesis, each gene was normalised to that of 18S ribosomal RNA and beta-actin mRNA, respectively. All reactions were run in singleplex on a StepOnePlus Real Time System (Applied Biosystems) at 95&#x000b0;C for 10&#x000a0;min, followed by 40&#x000a0;cycles at 95&#x000b0;C for 15&#x000a0;s and 60&#x000b0;C for 1&#x000a0;min. Two-fold dilution series were performed for all primer pairs to verify the linearity of the assay. In addition, dissociation curve analysis was performed after each PCR to check for unspecific signals. Quantification was performed using the comparative cycle threshold (2<sup>-&#x02206;&#x02206;Ct</sup>) method.</p><p>The following primers were used: CXCL9 fwr: 5&#x02032;-AGGCACCCCAGTAATGAG-3&#x02032;; CXCL9 rev: 5&#x02032;-TGATTTCTGTTTTCTCACACG-3&#x02032;; CXCL10 fwr: 5&#x02032;-TCTGAGTGGGACTCAAGGAATACC-3&#x02032;; CXCL10 rev: 5&#x02032;-TCCAGACATCTCTTCTCCCCATTC-3&#x02032;; beta-actin fwr: 5&#x02032;-GAGGCACCAGGGAGTCATG-3&#x02032;; beta-actin rev: 5&#x02032;-AAGGTGTGGTGCCAGATCTTCTC-3&#x02032;; 18S rRNA fwr: 5&#x02032;-GTACAGTGAAACTGCGAATGGCTC-3&#x02032;; 18S rRNA rev: 5&#x02032;-CCGTCGGCATGTATTAGCTCTAG-3&#x02032;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Human COPD clinical studies</title><p>In order to assess the clinical relevance of the findings in respect to the guinea pig dataset, we took advantage of a human microarray dataset we have previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This defined the baseline/resting transcriptional state of the <italic>vastus lateralis</italic> muscle in severe COPD patients with either a normal (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;9) or low (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) body mass index (BMI) and healthy controls matched for age and smoking history (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;12). In addition, the low BMI COPD group also had a significantly lower fat free mass index (FFMI) (on average 16.7&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>), a clear surrogate for muscle wasting. All participants signed a written, informed consent approved by the Ethics Committee on Investigations Involving Human Subjects at the Hospital Clinic, Universitat de Barcelona, and the study was conducted in accordance with principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Briefly, raw Affymetrix CEL files were RMA normalized following removal of probes that were termed &#x02018;absent&#x02019; in more than 80% of the samples by the MAS5 algorithm inside the affy package (26,197 probes were discarded). Following probe summarization, a two-class unpaired SAM analysis was performed using the R package &#x02018;samr&#x02019; comparing gene expression levels between COPD patients with a muscle wasting phenotype and matched controls. Enrichment of KEGG terms (group 1 to 4) in the resulting gene lists was assessed using DAVID. Enriched terms used to define the &#x02018;true response&#x02019; in the cross-species overlap analysis were defined as having an EASE score <italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c;0.2. Further, detailed demographic data on the human subjects, including pulmonary measurements are provided in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>. The raw microarray CEL files are deposited under the reference number GSE27536.</p><p>In addition, we also analysed a public microarray dataset published by the Ronald Crystal lab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] examining transcriptional changes in small airway epithelium from healthy non-smokers (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;47), healthy smokers (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;58) and smokers with COPD (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;22), respectively (GSE19407). Due to a clear scan date batch issue (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>, Figure A), we focused our analysis on the data generated in years 2006 and 2007 (hence excluding the two samples scanned in 2005 as well as the 36 samples processed in 2008). As both human studies were conducted on the Affymetrix U133&#x02009;+&#x02009;2 platform, the data analysis strategy of the raw CEL files representing the pulmonary data was identical to that of the human dataset in skeletal muscle presented in this paper (see above) (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref> for the list of regulated transcripts with fold-changes as well as functional enrichment analysis).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Summarising the molecular state of skeletal muscle using indices of pathway transcriptional activity</title><p>In order to reduce the complexity of the genome-wide transcriptional state of guinea pig skeletal muscles, thereby increasing statistical power, we computed indices of the overall pathway transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. For each of the two guinea pig hindlimb muscles, we first mapped the thousands of individual gene expression measures onto KEGG pathways using DAVID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. We then summarised the transcriptional activity for the enriched pathways (FDR &#x0003c;10%) by computing the first three principal components (PCs), a procedure that allowed us to retain between 50% and 78% of the total variance (63% on average). Computation of the PCs was performed using the &#x02018;prcomp&#x02019; function within the statistical programming environment R (script available on request).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Inference of biological networks linking lung and skeletal muscles in guinea pigs</title><p>An exhaustive list of genes annotated to the cytokine superfamily (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;72) was compiled from the SABiosciences PCR Array Web Portal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>, worksheet 1 for the complete list). Such an approach has been used previously for compiling gene-lists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Among these candidates we identified 33 genes coding for cytokines, which were differentially expressed in guinea pig lung tissue (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>, worksheet 2). These were selected for further analysis.

However, exposure to CH in <italic>gastro</italic> also yielded a highly statistically significant overlap with the clinical dataset as highlighted by a 53% functional overlap.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Gene expression profiling as a tool to assess animal model relevance of human disease</title><p>Most pre-clinical models of CS-induced COPD have for obvious reasons focused on the lung component of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. However, with the increasing awareness of the clinically important extrapulmonary manifestations linked to COPD, a number of studies have now begun to try to elucidate the mechanisms governing skeletal muscle dysfunction, whether or not accompanied by loss of muscle mass. Consistent with COPD, previous studies have shown marked reduction in body weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] as well as increased oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] in guinea pig hindlimb muscles following only 3&#x000a0;months of daily CS exposure. In contrast, macroscopic data suggest that mouse models poorly reproduce the systemic effects of human COPD. For example, long-term exposure to CS only induces mild effects in selected skeletal muscles, as defined by fibre redistribution and altered oxidative enzyme activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], despite both studies using much longer exposure protocols than that of the present study.</p><p>It may be important to assess and compare the relevance of the current guinea pig model with that of other rodent CS models such as the mouse. Although an extensive microarray analysis of such model has not been published, we have been able to retrieve a dataset from the GEO database (GSE18033). In order to comment on the suitability of this dataset to address this important issue, we analysed this data using the same approach described in this paper (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">13</xref> for the full analysis).</p><p>The experiment performed was limited to the gastrocnemius, which our analysis in the guinea pigs suggests is not the most representative of human COPD. However, before any comparison could be made, our analysis only identified 24 genes that were differentially modulated by chronic CS-exposure (24&#x000a0;weeks) in hindlimb gastrocnemius muscle compared with time-matched sham controls at a reasonable statistical threshold (FDR &#x0003c;15%). Only by raising the statistical cutoff to 30%, which increased the number of regulated transcripts to 1,020 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">13</xref>: Table S3), could we detect biologically relevant functions, although the maximum sensitivity of 0.11 was substantially lower than any of the experimental conditions involving CS-exposure in the current guinea pig model (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). Although further analysis of the mouse model is required for reaching any definitive conclusion, these results indicate poor transcriptional response following smoking exposure in mice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>There are a number of indications that the current nose-only guinea pig smoking model is useful for studying extrapulmonary effects of COPD, as previously pointed out, including an oxidative stress phenotype in limb muscle as well as induction of plasma inflammatory mediators.</p><p>The data presented herein provide further evidence for the utility of the guinea pig smoking model for replicating key clinical traits in human COPD, particularly as a tool for identifying systemic signals influencing peripheral skeletal muscle function. Hence, these data should facilitate more detailed interrogation of current guinea pig models of human disease, likely promoting further therapeutic development.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec27"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13073_2014_59_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1</label><caption><p>
