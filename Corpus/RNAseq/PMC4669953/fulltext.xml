Here, we identify Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling as a central regulator of intestinal SC (ISC) activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We find that dietary L-glutamate stimulates ISC division and gut growth. The metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) is required in ISCs for this response and for an associated modulation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations that results in sustained high cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. High cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> induces ISC proliferation by regulating Calcineurin and CREB - regulated transcriptional co-activator (CRTC). In response to a wide range of dietary and stress stimuli, ISCs reversibly transition between Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation states that represent poised or activated modes of proliferation, respectively. We propose that the dynamic regulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels allows effective integration of diverse mitogenic signals in ISCs to tailor their proliferative activity to the needs of the tissue.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Somatic SCs can shift between quiescent and active states and between asymmetric and symmetric division modes according to the regenerative need of a tissue <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.

Sustained elevation of cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] is thus sufficient and required to induce ISC proliferation.

We propose that excessive dietary L-Glu is not efficiently resorbed by ECs and activates mGluR in ISCs. The L-Glu signal is integrated with local and systemic stress and growth factor signals to promote ISC proliferation in a CaN/CRTC dependent manner.
