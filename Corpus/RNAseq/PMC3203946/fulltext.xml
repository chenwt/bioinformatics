To determine the genes responsible for this phenotype in the thirteen-lined ground squirrel (<italic>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus</italic>) we used the Roche 454 platform to sequence mRNA isolated at six points throughout the year from three key tissues: heart, skeletal muscle, and white adipose tissue (WAT). Deep sequencing generated approximately 3.7 million cDNA reads from 18 samples (6 time points &#x000d7;3 tissues) with a mean read length of 335 bases. Of these, 3,125,337 reads were assembled into 140,703 contigs. Approximately 90&#x00025; of all sequences were matched to proteins in the human UniProt database. The total number of distinct human proteins matched by ground squirrel transcripts was 13,637 for heart, 12,496 for skeletal muscle, and 14,351 for WAT. Extensive mitochondrial RNA sequences enabled a novel approach of using the transcriptome to construct the complete mitochondrial genome for <italic>I. tridecemlineatus</italic>. Seasonal and activity-specific changes in mRNA levels that met our stringent false discovery rate cutoff (1.0&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;11</sup>) were used to identify patterns of gene expression involving various aspects of the hibernation phenotype. Among these patterns are differentially expressed genes encoding heart proteins AT1A1, NAC1 and RYR2 controlling ion transport required for contraction and relaxation at low body temperatures. Abundant RNAs in skeletal muscle coding ubiquitin pathway proteins ASB2, UBC and DDB1 peak in October, suggesting an increase in muscle proteolysis. Finally, genes in WAT that encode proteins involved in lipogenesis (ACOD, FABP4) are highly expressed in August, but gradually decline in expression during the seasonal transition to lipolysis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The investigation of complex phenotypes in eukaryotes has been largely confined to a handful of exhaustively studied &#x0201c;model organisms.&#x0201d; The advantage of studying this small number of plants and animals is due to a combination of factors such as ease of maintenance, a large research community, genetic selection of mutants, funded stock centers, and sequenced genomes. As a result major advances in genetics and molecular biology have been made using this select group of species. Of course, the living world is filled with novel phenotypes that are not found in the most commonly studied organisms. Mammalian hibernation is one of these phenotypes.</p><p>Hibernation is a seasonal adaptation that results in a major departure from standard mammalian homeostasis. Radical depressions in metabolism, heart rate, body temperature and oxygen consumption allow small mammals to survive up to 6 months with little or no food in a state of suspended animation called torpor (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027021-Andrews1">[1]</xref>). Near freezing body temperatures, heart rates of 4&#x02013;6 beats per minute, and depressed metabolism are characteristics of the deep torpor that occurs during hibernation. Mysteriously, hypothermic torpor bouts are interrupted by brief normothermic interbout arousals (IBAs) every 1&#x02013;3 weeks depending on the species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027021-Carey1">[2]</xref>. The mechanistic basis of the hibernation phenotype is unknown, but mounting evidence from a wide variety of animals suggests that it is controlled in part by the differential expression of specific genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027021-Srere1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027021-Melvin1">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Over the past decade microarray hybridization has been commonly used as a means of measuring gene activity by whole tissue transcription profiling. More recently massive parallel sequencing has played a larger role in quantifying gene expression by deep sequencing the transcriptome. The term &#x0201c;deep sequencing&#x0201d; refers to the millions of RNA sequence reads that are generated by this method. Deep sequencing the transcriptome, also known as RNAseq, provides both the sequence and frequency of RNA molecules that are present at any particular time in a specific cell type, tissue or organ. Counting the number of mRNAs that are encoded by individual genes provides an indicator of protein-coding potential, a major contributor to phenotype.</p><p>We have performed RNAseq using the Roche 454 system to identify genes that are expressed in active and hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels (<italic>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus)</italic> at six points throughout the year. We used this approach to obtain a better understanding of the hibernation phenotype in three distinct organs: heart, skeletal muscle, and white adipose. The heart is a contractile organ that must continue to work despite the physiological extremes of torpor. Skeletal muscle is inactive when the animal is in torpor and sees only limited activity during periodic IBAs. White adipose tissue is the primary fuel storage depot for both organs throughout the hibernation season.</p><p>Deep sequencing the transcriptome offers many advantages over other methods for measuring gene activity such as microarrays, which have hybridization bias detection, higher background and require more sample quantity. The 454 platform generates individual RNA sequence reads up to 600 bases in length. This size is useful for non-model organisms such as the thirteen-lined ground squirrel where longer read length greatly facilitates reliable assembly and identification of the corresponding transcript. In this study we generated 3.7 million reads, added original cDNA sequence to the thirteen-lined ground squirrel database, and report a novel approach for sequencing the mitochondrial genome that can be applied to other eukaryotes. Moreover, we have uncovered new patterns of differential gene activity throughout the year that contribute to our understanding of the hibernation phenotype.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal use in this study was carried out in strict accordance with the approval of the University of Minnesota Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol #0805A34502). Thirteen-lined ground squirrels were wild-caught in central Minnesota. Animals were housed at the University of Minnesota School of Medicine Duluth, where they were fed Purina Laboratory Rodent Diet 5001 and provided with water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Animals were maintained at 23&#x000b0;C with a 12&#x02236;12 light:dark cycle (7 a.m. to 7 p.m.).</p><p>For each time point, 3 males and 3 females with weights within one standard deviation of the mean were selected for study. Animals with obvious health defects were excluded from consideration. A summary of animal characteristics including weight, body temperature, and food availability at the time of sacrifice is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0027021-t001">Table 1</xref>. April animals were sacrificed within 48 hours of capture in the wild to measure gene expression in the early spring when active animals are leanest. August active animals were in the fattening phase and continued to gain weight in preparation for hibernation. Active animals in October reached a plateau in body weight and most animals began to enter brief torpor bouts in captivity despite continued ambient conditions of 12L&#x02236;12D at 23&#x000b0;C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027021-Russell1">[5]</xref>. On October 30 animals captured in the previous spring and summer were switched to 24 hour darkness at 5&#x000b0;C to mimic the natural conditions of underground burrows during the hibernation season. January torpor and IBA animals were sacrificed after two months of uninterrupted darkness, ambient temperature of 5&#x000b0;C, and no food. On March 12 light and temperature returned to 12L&#x02236;12D at 23&#x000b0;C. Aroused March animals were maintained for 24 hours without food after returning to non-hibernating conditions of light and temperature. Active animals sacrificed for this final time point therefore spent the previous 4.5 months under fasting conditions.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0027021-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0027021.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Time points (months) and corresponding states of activity, mean animal mass, mean body temperature, and food availability at the time when tissues were collected for RNA extraction.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0027021-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0027021.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Collection point</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">State</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mass</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Body Temperature</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Food Availability</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">April</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Active</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">165&#x000b1;14 g</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37.6&#x000b1;0.4&#x000b0;C</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">August</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Active</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">231&#x000b1;9 g</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36.7&#x000b1;0.4&#x000b0;C</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">October</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Active</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">248&#x000b1;10 g</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">32.4&#x000b1;1.9&#x000b0;C</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">January</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Torpid</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">176&#x000b1;13 g</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.0&#x000b1;0.4&#x000b0;C</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">January</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">IBA</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">180&#x000b1;10 g</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28.1&#x000b1;3.0&#x000b0;C</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">March</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Arousal</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">163&#x000b1;25 g</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">35.3&#x000b1;0.4&#x000b0;C</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><label/><p><italic>Abbreviation</italic> &#x02013; IBA, interbout arousal.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Tissue collection</title><p>All animal surgical procedures were performed under isoflurane anesthesia and all efforts were made to minimize potential pain and suffering.

For each pooled cDNA library, four single tube emPCR amplification reactions were prepared using different input amounts (2, 4, 8 and 16 molecules per bead; Roche Technical Bulletin for Updated Titration Range for GS-FLX Titanium emPCR Lib-L Kit, March 2010).

An important additional source of error arises from artificial sequence replicates during the PCR emulsion step of the 454 amplification and sequencing, when more than one streptavidin bead is present in a PCR reaction droplet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027021-GomezAlvarez1">[12]</xref>. In such cases, many identical reads can be generated, distorting the expression signature of a gene. We corrected for these replicates by removing reads that were identical in the first 36 bases when at least three such reads were present at only one time point.</p><p>To identify differentially expressed genes across the six sampled points we first determined the p-value of a six-way Fisher's exact test for each gene. These p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons by calculating false discovery rate (FDR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0027021-Benjamini1">[13]</xref>). To create a list of differentially expressed genes of high confidence for further analysis, we used a stringent false discovery rate cutoff of 1.0&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;11</sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Experimental design</title><p>This study was designed to provide a yearlong examination of gene activity responsible for the hibernation phenotype. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0027021-t001">Table 1</xref> shows the six time points when heart, skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue were harvested for the purpose of RNA preparation.

To do this we developed a mathematical model of read density.</p><p>To model the distribution of reads along a mitochondrial gene, we assume: (1) the gene produces a single transcript type of length L, and (2) the observed distribution of read lengths results from a uniform (unbiased) fragmentation of the original transcripts. If we have a read of length J&#x02264;L drawn from this distribution, it has L-J&#x0002b;1 possible starting locations along the transcript. For the I<sup>th</sup> position on the transcript, the number of such read locations that overlap it is the minimum of {I, J, L-I&#x0002b;1, L-J&#x0002b;1}. So the probability p(I,J,L) of a read of length J overlapping position I in a transcript of length L is min({I, J, L-I&#x0002b;1, L-J&#x0002b;1})/(L-J&#x0002b;1). For fixed L and J this is a piecewise-linear function of I. An example graph of this function is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027021-g004">Figure 4A</xref> for the case L&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2000 and J&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;400. We average these probabilities over all the observed read lengths for each mitochondrial gene, weighted by the frequency of those lengths, which results in an expected density that is somewhat smoother than the piecewise linear components. The predicted distributions from this model are shown in blue along with the actual read distributions (in black) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0027021-g004">Figure 4B</xref>. Coefficients of determination, R<sup>2</sup>, were computed for each protein-coding sequence and ranged from a high of 0.89 for COX2 to 0.05 for COX1.

ACOD converts a single carbon-carbon bond into a double bond thus turning a saturated fatty acid into an unsaturated fatty acid.

This new approach of measuring gene activity opens the door for investigating other novel phenotypes in the vast world of &#x0201c;non-model&#x0201d; organisms. In thirteen-lined ground squirrels we not only found new patterns of gene activity in heart, skeletal muscle and white adipose, we also generated sequence for over 14,000 different mRNAs and used a portion of the transcriptome data to generate the complete sequence of the mitochondrial genome. As expected we found differentially expressed genes involved in the carbohydrate to lipid fuel switch, as well as enhanced ion transport required for heart contraction during torpor. Interestingly, transcripts coding ubiquitin pathway proteins UBC, ASB2 and DDB1 are abundant and peak in October. This intriguing finding suggests that ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis could provide a mechanism by which skeletal muscle can be catabolized and serve as a secondary fuel depot during winter.</p><p>The overall abundance of genes with varying expression patterns in the entire dataset presents an unparalleled opportunity to explore the molecular mechanisms controlling hibernation in mammals.
