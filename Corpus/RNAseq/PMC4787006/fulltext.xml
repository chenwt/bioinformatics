Transcriptomic data could help understand the bases of its original life-traits, including a striking case of polyphenism, with forms feeding on roots and forms feeding in leaf-galls. Comparisons with true aphids (for which complete genomes have been sequenced) should also allow to link differences in life-traits of the two groups with changes in gene repertoires or shifts in patterns of expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We sequenced transcriptomes of the grapevine phylloxera (Illumina technology), choosing three life-stages (adults on roots or on leaf galls, and eggs) to cover a large catalogue of transcripts, and performed a <italic>de novo</italic> assembly. This resulted in 105,697 contigs, which were annotated: most contigs had a best blastx hit to the pea aphid (phylogenetically closest complete genome), while very few bacterial hits were recorded (except for <italic>Probionibacterium acnes</italic>). Coding sequences were predicted from this data set (17,372 sequences), revealing an extremely high AT-bias (at the third codon position). Differential expression (DE) analysis among root-feeding and gall-feeding showed that i) the root-feeding form displayed a much larger number of differentially expressed transcripts ii) root-feeding biased genes were enriched in some categories, for example cuticular proteins and genes associated with cell-cell signaling iii) leaf-galling-biased genes were enriched in genes associated with the nucleus and DNA-replication, suggesting a metabolism more oriented towards fast and active multiplication. We also identified a gene family with a very high expression level (copies totaling nearly 10&#x000a0;% of the reads) in the grapevine phylloxera (both in root and leaf galling forms), but usually expressed at very low levels in true aphids (except in sexual oviparous females). These transcripts thus appear to be associated with oviparity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study illustrated major intraspecific changes in transcriptome profiles, related with different life-styles (and the feeding on roots versus in leaf-galls).

Insects provide many examples of polyphenism, with sometimes striking differences in morphological traits and metabolism (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]). The extense and evolutionary maintenance of polyphenism is the result of a balance of constraints and selective forces, and reflects the ability of an organism to display flexible development systems and to fine-tune development with environmental cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It is now well established that polyphenism is characterized by marked differences in profiles of gene expression, whereas the genes or functional groups of genes affected by these genes are specific to each organism (see examples for wing polyphenism in aphids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] or social castes in honey bees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]).</p><p>The size of gene repertoires of each organism results from of a balance between gene duplication and gene loss, a dynamic process that could be a significant source of evolutionary novelty and adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Theoretical models and sequence data have been both explored to precise how and when gene duplicates can persist over time, and how they can provide a mechanism of adaptation to environmental changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As a first step into acquiring a comprehensive understanding of a striking case of polyphenism in an insect species, the grapevine phylloxera (<italic>Daktulosphaira vitifoliae</italic>), we have used a transcriptome sequencing approach as a way of gene expression profiling among some of its different phenotypes. We also used these data to identity gene families and get first insights on the interaction between phylogenetic aspects, in particular in gene families, and expression patterns. We have explored this interaction for gene families containing copies with the highest level expression and for a gene family showing transcripts with different patterns of morph-biased expression.</p><p>Grapevine phylloxera is an invasive pest species with worldwide economic importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This insect native to North America was accidentally introduced in Europe around 1850 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], where it became a pest of cultivated grapevine (<italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>) which is highly susceptible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Soon after its unintended introduction, phylloxera caused the collapse of the whole European viticulture and of its economy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Only after more than 30&#x000a0;years of research, a cure to this plague was found with the grafting of grapevine varieties on rootstocks resistant to the insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Phylloxera is still found in almost every wine-producing region of the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It remains a major constraint for viticulture imposing the grafting of <italic>V. vinifera</italic> and quarantine regulations in areas (e.g. Australia) where varieties are predominantly grown own&#x02010;rooted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>The life-cycle of phylloxera is special in several aspects: in particular, this insect has different forms that feed respectively on leaves and roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Individuals forming galls on leaves are called gallicoles (hereafter abbreviated as GA), and on roots, radicicoles (hereafter abbreviated as RA). Leaf-feeding forms are rare on grapevine (due to natural resistance of the plant), while the root-feeding forms are still present, even on rootstocks used for grapevine grafting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Given the different environmental and nutritional constraints faced by these two forms, we may expect that they are characterized by a modulation of gene expression as an adaptation to their specific conditions. The noxious effects on <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> result from the root-feeding insects, which cause woundings alterating the circulation of sap and facilitating the entrance of microbial pathogens.</p><p><italic>D. vitifoliae</italic> (grape phylloxera) belongs to the Phylloxeroidea, a small monophyletic superfamily of the Hemiptera closely related to the Aphidoidea (the true aphids). The Aphidoidea and the Phylloxeroidea probably diverged in the Jurassic or earlier from some aphid-like ancestor whose origin can be traced back up to about 250 My ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. While not an aphid <italic>sensu stricto</italic>, phylloxera shares a subset of the biological traits associated with aphids, and provides an interesting model for comparative genomics among the two groups. Comparisons among the phylloxera and true aphids (for example, the pea aphid genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]) should indeed bring insight into the evolution of their peculiar life-traits. For example, true aphids are viviparous (except for one generation of sexual female per annual life-cycle) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], while phylloxera is always oviparous. The two groups also differ in other aspects, such as the association with endosymbionts, sap feeding habits and digestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Hardly any genomic/transcriptomic resources exist as today for the phylloxera despite its potential economical and scientific importance. In order to identify the array of expressed genes by different forms and to provide insights into the evolution and genetic bases of specific aphid and phylloxera life-traits, we performed a first characterization of phylloxera transcriptomes. We adopted a strategy based on high throughput Illumina sequencing of cDNA, since this approach has been shown to produce high quality <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptomes, and is well suited for differential expression analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We identified, annotated and compared transcripts to existing databases (including the complete pea aphid genome), allowing to discover some phylloxera-specific gene families, reconstructed a large catalogue of predicted coding sequences, and analysed patterns of nucleotidic composition. We finally performed a differential expression analysis to compare transcript abundance in leaf and root-feeding forms and found significant changes in expression among the two forms. We also identified i) a gene family that is extremely highly expressed in both morphs and appears to be associated with oviparity, illustrating major changes in expression associated with change in life-traits between phylloxera and the true aphids ii) a gene family containing two closely related copies characterized by opposite patterns of expression bias among morphs, showing a case of rapid switch in the specificity of expression following duplication.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Insect collection and rearing</title><p>In June 2010, an unusually high infestation of phylloxera on leaves of cv. Cabernet franc (<italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>) grafted on Fercal rootstock was observed at Ch&#x000e2;teau Couhins (Cru class&#x000e9; de Grave, Pessac&#x02010;L&#x000e9;ognan, Bordeaux AOC, France). Phylloxera leaf galls were collected from this vineyard and a population was established in an insect&#x02010;proof cage in greenhouse conditions. A single leaf-galling phylloxera female was isolated from this population. Its clonal offspring (and subsequent clonal generations) were named INRA-Pcf7. Leaf-feeding insects of the INRA-Pcf7 lineage were reared on the leaves of the inter-specific hybrid Harmony which is susceptible to leaf-galling phylloxera. Harmony young plants were produced in aseptic culture conditions, planted in sterile soil within insect-proof cages. These leaf-galling insects were maintained in a growth chamber at 23&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, 70&#x000a0;% humidity with a L:16/D:8 photoperiod. Root-feeding insects of the INRA-Pcf7 lineage were obtained by inoculating cv. Cabernet Sauvignon (<italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>) roots with leaf-galling eggs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Fresh and healthy pieces 5&#x02013;7&#x000a0;cm long of roots of Cabernet Sauvignon were washed with sterile water and placed on a wet filter paper disk inside Petri dishes sealed with parafilm. About 50 phylloxera eggs were transferred in each Petri dish and spread on these roots. The dishes were kept in plastic boxes and incubated at 23&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, 70&#x000a0;% relative humidity and 24-h darkness.</p><p>Five samples were prepared in total for the sequencing experiment: two samples of leaf-feeding adult insects and two samples of root-feeding adult insects (each sample comprised 500 individuals) while the last sample was prepared with 500 eggs from root-feeding insects. Two replicates were prepared for leaf-feeding and root-feeding samples. Total RNA was extracted directly from fresh material (insects were not frozen or stored before extraction).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>RNA extraction and library preparation and sequencing</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from each of the five samples using RNeasy Kit QIAGEN for animal cells and tissues (Qiagen, Nederland), including a DNase treatment. RNA molecules longer than 200 nucleotides were bound to a silica column membrane and eluted in RNase-free water. The quantity of RNA was measured with NanoDrop&#x000ae; ND-1000 UV&#x02013;vis Spectrophotometer with an absorbance from about 200&#x000a0;nm up to 350&#x000a0;nm. Roughly 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of total RNA were obtained for each sample. The quality of the RNA samples was tested with the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. The intensity ratio 28S/18S after the separation of total RNA on denaturing agarose gel electrophresis was around two which corresponds to good quality samples. RNA Integrity Numbers (RIN) for the different samples ranged between 5.8 and 7.4. The cDNA libraries -Truseq, v3 chemistry, with poly-A selection, were performed according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), then sequencing was done on the Hiseq2000. The five cDNA libraries were sequenced in pair-ends, with reads of 101&#x000a0;bp, by the GATC company (Germany). Samples were sequenced in two different runs (GA and RA on one run, while the egg sample was sequenced in another run). The raw sequence data has been deposited in the SRA division of Genbank (project accession: PRJNA294954).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Cleaning of sequences and assembly</title><p>Analyzing the GC content and the over-representation of sequences with the fastqc software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>), we did not see any evidence of contamination, nor unexpected presence of adapters in any library. Low quality parts of the reads were trimmed from the right when the mean of phred score in a 20&#x000a0;bp window was below 20, with prinseq-lite (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://prinseq.sourceforge.net/">http://prinseq.sourceforge.net/</ext-link>). The reads larger than 20&#x000a0;bp after trimming were re-organized by pairs and assembled with Trinity with the jaccard_clip option to limit fusion transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and default parameters for other options.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Clustering of sequences</title><p>The primary assembly contained multiple contigs with closely related sequences, generally being alternative transcripts (typically differing by large indels that correspond to facultative/alternative exons, while aligning sequences were identical). To reduce this redundancy, contigs were clustered using a home-made program (available upon request) detecting contig sequences matching each other (based on a megablast search, with an identity cutoff of <italic>p&#x02009;=</italic>&#x02009;0.99 over a length of at least 200&#x000a0;bp, and matches spanning at least 50&#x000a0;% of both the query and the hit). For each cluster, the longest sequence was retained. All subsequent analyses were performed on this reduced data set.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Annotation</title><p>Contig sequences were compared by blastx (blastall program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], version 2.2.28+) to the complete genome of the pea aphid <italic>Acyrthosiphon pisum</italic> (using the version 2.1 of predicted proteins, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aphidbase.com">www.aphidbase.com</ext-link>). In parallel, a blastx search of similarity was performed against public general databases (nr, with an e-value cutoff of 1e-8). Also, completeness of the assembled transcriptome was assessed using the BUSCO software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]: the method searches homologies to a core set of 2,712 highly conserved genes in all arthropods (we used the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> sequences). Finally, a blastn search was performed against potentially contaminant sequences, i.e. ribosomal RNA or mitochondrial sequences (using sequences from <italic>A. pisum</italic>). Then a BLAST2GO annotation helped by blastx results against nr and by an interproscan search (v4.8, against the 06/25/2013 version of interpro), was performed using the blast2go database (08/2012 version).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Genomic features</title><p>Prediction of coding sequences (CDSs and protein sequences) was performed using the Transdecoder tool from the Trinity package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], which uses a self-training procedure and a Hidden-Markov model approach for ORF detection. This allowed a comparison of coding sequences with the nearest completely sequenced taxon, the pea aphid. Such comparison, aimed at identifying potential orthologs and gene families that would be specific to phylloxera, was done with OrthoMCL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Then the predicted CDSs sequences allowed us to evaluate compositional patterns in the phylloxera, measuring nucleotide frequencies at the three codon positions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Read mapping to contigs and counts of expression per library- Phylogeny of the most abundantly transcribed gene family</title><p>RNA-seq allows to capture the digital gene expression information in the form of relative read coverage. For this, the reads were aligned by pairs and by library back to the contigs with bowtie2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] with the non-deterministic parameter (only the best alignment is reported, or a random hit among the best if the read maps in many places). The counts of reads by contigs and library were then obtained with the samtools <italic>idxstats</italic> program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. To also get insight on the most expressed transcripts across all libraries (which could be linked with specificities of the phylloxera biology), we investigated the potential phylogenetic relationships among the corresponding genes, in particular for a 6-gene family and for their orthologs in other insect species. A phylogenetic study of this gene family was performed: the proteic alignment was obtained with T-coffee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] then trimmed with Gblocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The phylogeny was obtained using MEGA6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], using a ML method and evaluating bootstrap support for nodes (1000 replicates).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Differential expression analyses</title><p>Normalization of read counts and statistical comparison of expression of the contigs were performed using DESeq2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], focusing on the comparison between GA and RA libraries, for which two replicates were available. Adjusted p-values indicated levels of significance of an expression bias among the two conditions (the software using information on the variability between replicates and between conditions). The log2-fold ratio of the normalized expressions of GA (mean of the two replicates) versus RA libraries was also used to determine lists of genes that showed a morph-biased expression pattern. Differentially expressed (DE) transcripts were defined as genes with a significant difference in expression (to further decrease the risk of false positives, we selected an adjusted p-value threshold of 0.01) and a log2fold change greater than one (meaning that the contig was supported by at least twice more reads on average in one condition than in the alternative condition). An &#x0201c;unbiased&#x0201d; category was also defined (contigs for which we found an adjusted p-value &#x0003e;0.05 and log2fold change &#x0003c;1). In order to identify the putative functions of genes specifically over-expressed in each form, GO-enrichment analyses were performed by comparing the GA-biased (or RA-biased) with the &#x0201c;unbiased&#x0201d; list and also by comparing GA-biased and RA-biased genes. Multiple testing was accounted for by using the False Discovery Rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], with a cutoff of 0.05 to determine significant differences.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Evolutionary rates</title><p>Putative orthologs between grapevine phylloxera (reconstructed coding sequences from this transcriptome) and pea aphid (official gene set from the complete genome) were identified by clustering protein sequences from both species (OrthoMCL).

Before reverse transcription, a DNAse I treatement was performed (Sigma Aldrich). One microgram of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using Superscript III (ThermoScientific) and oligo dT (Promega).

GA-biased showed the highest non-synonymous rates, followed by RA-biased genes, then by genes with an unbiased expression (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Non-synonymous rates (dN) for unbiased (UB, <italic>n&#x02009;=</italic>&#x02009;25,683), GA-biased (GA, <italic>n&#x02009;=</italic>&#x02009;1,125) and RA-biased (RA, <italic>n&#x02009;=</italic>&#x02009;4,485) genes: boxplot of pairwise estimates of dN between putative orthologous sequences of grapevine phylloxera and of the pea aphid</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2016_2530_Fig6_HTML" id="MO6"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Discussion</title><p>The aim of this study was to develop new sequence resources for the grapevine phylloxera (<italic>D. vitifoliae</italic>), an organism which is both a major pest for viticulture and an important model for comparative genomics studies of plant sucking insects. By sequencing RNA libraries of different morphs, we assembled and explored the phylloxera transcriptome, building a collection of coding sequences and comparing these sequences with the complete genome of a true aphid. We could by the way evaluate the presence of potential phylloxera-associated bacteria species, and finally compared the expression patterns of two widely different feeding conditions and environments.</p><p>By combining Illumina sequenced RNA libraries of different forms we have been able to reconstruct the first <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome of grapevine phylloxera, confirming that is approach is a very useful tool for generating large-scale information on the coding sequences of non-model organisms (for recent examples, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]). We indeed obtained 105,697 different transcripts, for which we predicted 17,372 proteins of which 12,617 being complete predicted proteins<italic>.</italic> RNA-seq approaches may fail to record sequences from very rare transcripts. Still, such high number of predicted genes is in the same range than the expected number of proteins identified in completely sequenced and well annotated genomes from different insect species (e.g. 13,953 for <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, release 6.01). Nonetheless, a much higher number of predicted proteins was proposed for the true aphid <italic>A. pisum</italic> (36,990; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]), which along with daphnia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], has an exceptionally duplication-rich genome for an arthropod. Although the exact timing of the vast gene expansion characterizing the pea aphid lineage is yet to be determined, the distribution of genetic distances among paralogs of <italic>A. pisum</italic> suggested that most duplications took place relatively recently in the evolution of aphids, and probably well after the divergence between true aphids and Phylloxeroidea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, we may expect that the number of different proteins for grapevine phylloxera would be closer to the average of other insect genomes, and thus that the transcriptome based predicted genes we obtained should represent a majority of the coding genome.</p><p>As a first attempt to annotate and characterize this assembled phylloxera transcriptome, we analysed blast hits to the nr database. Around 75&#x000a0;% of the 15,455 contigs with a hit matched to the pea aphid, while the next top species collected only 3&#x000a0;% of the hits. This reflects the much closer phylogenetic relationship between phylloxera and true aphids, compared to any other known genome. Another facet of this investigation was the potential to discover genes specific to the focus organism, and which could play a role in its specific adaptations. It is difficult to make any inference on single-copy gene with no known similarity to any other organism (because for example they may represent over-predicted open reading frames). But we hypothesize that families of predicted genes specific to phylloxera would be more likely to represent true genes and to be associated with some of the specific life-traits of this species. The OrthoMCL conducted in this study, comparing the pea aphid genome and phylloxera proteins, allowed to identify 683 families totaling 3047 genes unique to phylloxera. Further, most of these genes had no similarity to any known protein. For example, the two largest gene families comprised each up to 60 genes. Analysing the complete peptides in these families, we found the presence of a signal peptide (according to SignalP prediction), which suggest they could be secreted proteins, possibly playing a role in nutrition or host plant interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p>We also analyzed the specificities of this grapevine phylloxera transcriptome in terms of global expression levels, comparing to available data for the pea aphid for which extensive transcriptomics data have been produced. We focused on the contigs with the highest level of support, and thus the transcripts which appear to be the most highly expressed, and examined the nature of genes predicted for these contigs. Several of the top contigs appeared to represent a six-member gene family in the phylloxera, with similarity to another three-member gene family in the pea aphid. In total, the six genes for phylloxera comprise roughly 10&#x000a0;% of the sequenced reads both in radicioles and gallicoles, which are both oviparous asexual females, strict oviparity being a characteristic of this group (Phylloxeroidea). Analyzing expression of homologous genes from the pea aphid, we also found a similar high percentage of the total reads in one specific morph, the sexual oviparous females. But transcription levels were very low either in asexual females, the viviparous morph which largely dominates the life-cycle of <italic>A. pisum</italic>, or in males. Also, we recently sequenced a transcriptome for sexual oviparous females of <italic>Acyrthosiphon svalbardicum</italic> (unpublished data) and found an abundant level of the homologous genes in that data set. There is therefore a strong relationship between oviparity and a high level of expression of these transcripts. It is not clear to infer a function for these genes since no similarity was found outside the group of aphids. This is possibly related with the fact that members of this gene family are clearly very fast-evolving sequences, as deduced from the low score of alignments and long branch lengths of the tree. We may however hypothesize that these proteins are linked both in phylloxera and true aphids with the production of eggs, sexually or asexually, possibly playing a role of nutritional reserve. Our results therefore illustrate major shifts in transcription levels occurring along evolution and accompanying shifts in biological traits (here a transition from oviparity to viviparity in the ancestor in true aphids). Comparable shifts in expression have identified in cave fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and associated with adaptation to obscurity and reduced eye function.</p><p>The large collection of predicted coding sequences also allowed us to study the distribution of the GC content, distinguishing the different codon positions and comparing these statistics with the pea aphid. The pea aphid genome has been found to have a relatively high AT content (in particular at the third codon position with %GC3&#x02009;=&#x02009;36.9) compared to other insect genomes. Similar GC content was recorded for coding sequences from other species of Aphididae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The GC content at third codon position is typically most subject to change among organisms, as it often concerns synonymous sites. We found that the phylloxera CDSs are even richer in AT (%GC3&#x02009;=&#x02009;24.8), which seems to place it among the most AT-rich genomes among arthropods. A strong compositional shift has therefore occurred along the divergence between true aphids and the ancestor of phylloxera.</p><p>Nearly all members of the true aphids (Aphidoidea) possess endosymbiotic primary symbiotic bacteria localized in specialized cells (mycetocytes) which are localized next to the gut lumen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. These endosymbiotic bacteria (<italic>Buchnera</italic>) provide their host with essential amino acids that are not synthesized by the insect. Early studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] explored the possibility of symbionts in the grape phylloxera and identified structures which were thought to harbour symbionts. But this interpretation was contradicted by other authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and Buchner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] excluded the existence of <italic>Buchnera aphidicola</italic> in <italic>D. vitifoliae</italic> in his work on aphid symbiosis. Recently, it has confirmed the absence of <italic>Buchnera</italic> in <italic>D. vitifoliae</italic> using molecular genetic approaches. However, this author identified bacteria closely related to <italic>Pantoea agglomerans</italic> in parthenogenetic individuals and their eggs and leaf gall tissue for several grapevine phylloxera populations investigated. These bacteria were culturable on simple media suggesting no obligate relation with the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Also, for another Phylloxera species associated with hickory trees, <italic>Pantoea agglomerans</italic> was found in some but not all populations, suggesting that the association is not strict [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. A recent study demonstrated the presence of <italic>Pantoea</italic> sp. in vineyards soil and the bark of grapevine indicating that these bacteria could have a free-living lifestyle or be associated with the plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. In our study, we found few bacterial transcripts overall, with one exception (see below), and no contig of our assembled phylloxera transcriptome matched to <italic>Pantoea</italic>. We must remain cautious about the significance of this negative finding, given that our purification protocol using poly-A selection may have hindered detection of bacterial transcripts. Further studies with different protocols would be necessary to better evaluate the prevalence of <italic>P. agglomerans</italic> in that insect species.</p><p>However, we found abundant traces of transcripts (135 different contigs) from a bacteria closely related with <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic>, normally known as a human opportunistic pathogen. Although we first thought of contamination to explain this presence, a recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] has since brought biological and phylogenetic evidences for a recent association of this human pathogen with grapevine (<italic>V. vinifera</italic>). Fluorescent in-situ hybridization helped localize <italic>P. acnes</italic> in the bark, the xylem, and pith tissues of grapevine. The inability to cultivate any of the strains isolated suggested a symbiotic interaction with the host plant. Our result could therefore be explained by the presence of <italic>P. acnes</italic> in the plant sap ingested by the insects feeding in xylem (a specificity of phylloxera, by contrast with true aphids that feed on phloem).</p><p>We have been able to identify many genes with a bias in expression among two forms with contrasted feeding habits, e.g. the forms feeding on roots and leaves of grapevine. First, a much greater number of genes appeared to be expressed in the radicicole form than in the gallicole form. This might be consistent with the fact that gallicoles live in a protected environment, where some functions are less essential. For example, one of the striking differences concerned cuticular proteins, which were nearly systematically more expressed in RA than in GA librairies. This fits well with our own observations of the different morphs, gallicoles showing a thinner and more pale tegument than radicicole forms. Also, the literature reports that gallicole forms are distinct from radicicoles with respect to reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Gallicole forms indeed are highly fecund compared to radicicoles. This might explain the much higher importance of functions associated with DNA replication in gallicoles. Another important difference concerns genes that would be involved in neurological processes (a category which we found to be largely over-lapping with another GO annotation term, cell-cell signaling). These annotations are absent from the GA-biased set of genes, but well represented in the RA-biased genes. Possibly, more interactions with the environment are imposed on individuals having to feed underground, than on individuals protected in the leaf galls. Of note, two of the genes with the most negative log2fold change (much higher expression in GA compared to RA) and very high absolute level of expression in GA are annotated as serine protease, while a third gene in that category has similarity with Megourin, a peptide identified in a true aphid species, <italic>Megoura viciae</italic>. In insects, serine proteases have been notably associated in digestion and defense responses towards both microbial and parasitoid wasp invaders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Megourin, first identified in the vetch aphid <italic>Megoura viciae</italic> (P. Bulet <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished data) could be associated with innate immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. On the other hand, several of the genes with the most positive log2fold change (much higher expression in RA compared to GA) and very high absolute level of expression in RA are annotated as cytochrome P450-like. This ubiquist gene family is often associated in animals with development or with the metabolism of toxic compounds. At present, there is still no easy explanation for these differences between GA and RA with respect to potentially immune-related or detoxification systems. Another interesting result of this study is that paralogous sequences (gene copies that derive from duplication) may display sharp differences in expression specificity among conditions. We detected this at least for a pair of transcripts corresponding to two different copies of a gene similar to apyrase, an enzyme known to hydrolyse ATP (for phylloxera, these genes were named apyrase-1 and apyrase-2). These two copies were among the four target genes selected for the qPCR validation of RNAseq measures of expression. We found indeed that apyrase-1 and apyrase-2 which are 94.9&#x000a0;% nucleic identity and 93.54&#x000a0;% proteic identity -such high identity suggesting that they derive from a relatively recent duplication event- are respectively specific to leaf-gall-feeding and root-feeding forms. This provides an example of specialization of gene copies following duplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Finally, it is important to consider that in our experimental design, leaf-gall and root-feeding were exposed to different plant species, to closely reflect the field situation. Indeed, GA are the dominating form on the wild American species of <italic>Vitis</italic>, while RA essentially multiply on the roots of the cultivated grapevine. Therefore, the observed patterns of differential expression might have been explained by a combination of intrinsic differences among morphs and of host plant effects.</p><p>A final point of our study is the clear difference in evolutionary rates among genes with a biased expression and genes with an unbiased expression, the former showing faster-evolving protein sequences. It has been found that restricted gene expression breadth results in accelerated evolution, as has previously been demonstrated with studies on sex-specific and tissue-specific gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Insect polyphenism is determined by alternative gene expression profiles meaning that different subsets of genes contribute to the different morphs (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]). Therefore, this can theoretically affect their rate of evolution, morph-biased gene showing relaxed purifying selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. A recent study on <italic>A. pisum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] demonstrated that morph-biased genes exhibit faster rates of evolution (in terms of dN/dS) relative to unbiased genes. This pattern in <italic>A. pisum</italic> was particularly noticeable when differential expression rose to 5-fold or higher. These highly morph-biased genes may be functionally relevant for the morphs yet simultaneously be rapidly evolving in a potentially non-adaptive manner. The results on <italic>D. vitifoliae</italic> obtained here confirm this view. These results join the growing body of work showing that morph-biased genes evolving more quickly than ubiquitously expressed genes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have identified important differences among transcription levels of two forms of the grapevine phylloxera, suggesting that the two feeding conditions impose very different constraints and metabolisms. At a different scale, we have also identified one major shift in expression between grape vine phylloxera and true aphids, concerning a gene family for which very high expression levels seem to be associated with oviparity. More extensive work will be needed to clarify the functional signification of these changes of expression, and how they may be associated with specific life-traits. Also, more data will help determine the interaction between shifts in expression levels and the possibly different evolutionary pressures on the sequences of genes with different breadth of expression.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec23"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12864_2016_2530_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Primer sequences used for qRT-PCR.
