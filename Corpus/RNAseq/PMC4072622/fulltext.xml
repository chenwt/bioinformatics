Although tumor microenvironment has been shown to have a significant impact on the initiation and/or promotion of metastasis, the mechanism remains elusive. We previously reported that HCT-8 colon cancer cells underwent a phenotypic transition from an adhesive epithelial type (E-cell) to a rounded dissociated type (R-cell) via soft substrate culture, which resembled the initiation of metastasis. The objective of current study was to investigate the molecular and metabolic mechanisms of the E-R transition.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Global gene expressions of HCT-8 E and R cells were measured by RNA Sequencing (RNA-seq); and the results were further confirmed by real-time PCR. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), anoikis resistance, enzyme activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase 3 family, member A1 (ALDH3A1), and <italic>in vitro</italic> invasion assay were tested on both E and R cells. The deformability of HCT-8 E and R cells was measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM). To study the <italic>in vivo</italic> invasiveness of two cell types, athymic nude mice were intra-splenically injected with HCT-8 E or R cells and sacrificed after 9&#x000a0;weeks. Incidences of tumor development and metastasis were histologically evaluated and analyzed with Fisher&#x02019;s exact test.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Besides HCT-8, E-R transition on soft substrates was also seen in three other cancer cell lines (HCT116, SW480 colon and DU145 prostate cancer). The expression of some genes, such as ALDH3A1, TNS4, CLDN2, and AKR1B10, which are known to play important roles in cancer cell migration, invasion, proliferation and apoptosis, were increased in HCT-8 R cells. R cells also showed higher ALDH3A1 enzyme activity, higher ROS, higher anoikis resistance, and higher softness than E cells. More importantly, <italic>in vitro</italic> assay and <italic>in vivo</italic> animal models revealed that HCT-8 R cells were more invasive than E cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our comprehensive comparison of HCT-8 E and R cells revealed differences of molecular, phenotypical, and mechanical signatures between the two cell types. To our knowledge, this is the first study that explores the molecular mechanism of E-R transition, which may greatly increase our understanding of the mechanisms of cancer mechanical microenvironment and initiation of cancer metastasis.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>In vitro</italic> cancer microenvironment</kwd><kwd>Metastasis</kwd><kwd>Mechanotransduction</kwd><kwd>Cancer biomarkers</kwd><kwd>Invasiveness</kwd><kwd>Polyacrylamide hydrogel</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>During metastasis, cancer cells escape from the parent tumor, enter the circulatory system, invade host tissues, and form secondary tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Deciphering the mechanisms initiating metastasis remains elusive due to the difficulty of studying the early stages <italic>in vivo</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Cancer cells within the same tumor show a large degree of heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and thus, it is possible that a small fraction of the parent tumor cells are more plastic or stem-like than most others. With appropriate mechanical cues, such as a change in substrate stiffness within the emergent tumor microenvironment, these cells could differentiate into metastatic variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Alternatively, a small population of preexisting metastatic cell variants may be selected for expansion under the influence of appropriate tumor microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Towards this end, various cancer cell lines, for example those derived from human colon cancer tumors, have been used for <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. Many of these colon cancer cell lines with low metastatic potential (e.g., HCT-8, HCT-116, HT29) are epithelial in phenotype (E cell). When cultured on conventional plastic substrates, they adhere and spread, proliferate, and form E-cadherin-mediated junctions resulting in monolayers covering the entire dish with occasional mounds consisting of 2&#x02013;3 layers of cells. On top of these mounds or at their vicinity, a variant of the cancer cells is detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These variant cells are spherical in shape, and rare in number (1 rounded-shaped cell per 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> epithelial-shaped cells). They are called R cells due to their rounded morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Remarkably, the proportion of these R cell variants can be increased by a few orders of magnitude by culturing E cells on appropriately soft substrates. Under these culture conditions 70-90% of the original E cell layers transit to R cells after 17&#x02013;20 days in culture.</p><p>Increasing evidence suggests the mechanical microenvironment plays a role in cancer metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. For example, a stiffer microenvironment, induced by increased collagen crosslinking in breast cancer tumors <italic>in vivo</italic>, promotes initiation of metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. An appropriately soft fibrin gel microenvironment produces a metastatic variant of murine B16-F1 melanoma cells that are highly tumorigenic in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. It is known that cells generate forces that depend on the stiffness of the microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Thus tumor mechanical microenvironments may influence metastatic transition through local force cues that generate or select a subset of metastatic cells. It is then conceivable the multicellular mounds of HCT-8 cells originally observed in conventional cell culture, might have provided a soft microenvironmental niche that facilitated the production of R cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This hypothesis is substantially strengthened by our observation of mass scale production of R cells from E cells on soft substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We characterized HCT-8 R and E cells by comparing (a) their gene expression profile using RNA-seq, PCR analyses, and selected protein expression using direct enzyme and immunocytochemical analyses, and (b) their <italic>in vitro</italic> invasiveness using cell invasion assays, and <italic>in vivo</italic> metastatic activity in mice using a splenic implantation model. The results imply that R cells are significantly more metastatic than E cells, and the E-R transition induced by growth on soft substrates may offer a new paradigm for simulating the early events of metastasis accelerated by mechanical cues.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>E-to-R transition in other cell lines cultured on soft substrates</title><p>To explore whether E-R transition is peculiar only to HCT-8 cells, we observed an E-R transition in three other cancer cell lines (HCT116, SW480 colon and DU145 prostate cancer cells) cultured on substrates with various softness. We found colon cancer cell lines, SW480 and HCT116, show E-R transition on 1.0 and 10 kPa gels, respectively, after 10&#x000a0;days of culture, whereas the prostate cancer cell line, DU145, exhibits E-R transition on 10 kPa gel after 19&#x000a0;days (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The time points, e.g. 7th or 19th day, are precisely the earliest dates when the first abrupt phenotype change, i.e. cell rounding and dissociation from some (not all) parent cell islands, was observed after the cells were exposed to soft microenvironment. Following initial observation of cell dissociation in any cell island, the majority of all cell islands showed the E-R phenotype within an additional 1&#x02013;2 days. On hard polystyrene substrates, none of these cells show E-R transition.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Multiple cancer cells lines show E-R transition on appropriate soft substrates.

No E-R transition was observed on these ECM-incubated polystyrene, or the non-ECM-incubated polystyrene substrates. Previously, we reported that the soft gels with appropriate stiffness consistently gave rise to the E-R transition, irrespective of their ECM functionalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Therefore, we reasoned that, while ECM may possibly play a role in regulating some aspects of the E-R transition, the ECM cue was secondary to the substrate stiffness cue in initiation of this process. The results presented here were obtained using the non-ECM-incubated polystyrene.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA-Seq analysis reveals overexpression of metastasis-associated genes in R cells</title><p>To further characterize HCT-8 R cells, we performed comparative differential gene expression analyses following E-R transition using whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-Seq). Four cell populations, PS3, PS17, Gel3, and R; under selected temporal-spatial culture conditions were compared. The PS3 and PS17 cell populations are HCT-8 cells cultured on polystyrene (PS) substrate for 3 and 17&#x000a0;days, respectively, without any exposure to soft polyacrylamide (PA) gels. Cells under both conditions display the E cell phenotype and do not show an E-R transition. The Gel3 cell population is HCT-8 cells cultured on 20 kPa PA gels for 3&#x000a0;days, but still remained in the E cell phenotype. The R cell population is derived from HCT-8 R cells harvested from 20 kPa PA gels on 17<sup>th</sup> day, followed by expansion on PS substrate. In an effort to discover differential gene expression patterns in R cells due specifically to the E-R transition, we compared gene expression profiles of R cells with those of Gel 3, PS3, and PS17 cell populations (cell populations not exhibiting an E-R transition). To be scored as a differentially expressed gene, the gene had to satisfy two criteria; 1) observed as differentially expressed in R cells in all three comparisons (R <italic>vs</italic> Gel3, R <italic>vs</italic> PS3, and R <italic>vs</italic> PS17), and 2) could not show differential expression when PS17 and PS3 cell populations were compared. In this manner, we focused on the genes that were more likely differentially expressed due to the E-R transition rather than extended culture time on PS or initial exposure to PA.</p><p>We found that 11 genes were up regulated by 3 fold or greater in R cells with respect to those in Gel 3, PS3, and PS17 cells (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>; positive Y axis; q-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). These genes are associated with tumor promotion and invasion, repression of apoptosis, cell migration and proliferation, and generation of radical species (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Noticeably, the colon cancer stem cell marker, ALDH3A1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], was markedly up regulated in R cells. Two other genes, TNS4 and CLDN2, which are known as clinical markers for colon cancer staging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], also were upregulated in R cells. Ten other genes also were down regulated by 3 fold or greater in R cells (negative Y axis; q-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05; Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Their functionalities are associated with promotion of apoptosis, maintenance of tissue homeostasis, anti-proliferation, and tumor suppression (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Of all those genes, down-regulation of CKB gene was reported to promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in colon cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. These data suggest, following culture on the appropriately soft mechanical microenvironment, a metastasis-enhancing gene pattern is activated in R cells and this activation is likely associated with the characteristics of <italic>in vivo</italic> EMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Thus, the E-R transition is exemplified not only by a metastasis-like phenotype, but also a metastasis-like gene expression profile.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Summary of differentially expressed genes in HCT-8R cells as compared to E cells.</bold> RNA-Seq analyses were performed as described in Methods.

Normal cells undergo programmed cell death, i.e., anoikis, when kept unattached to a substrate matrix or neighboring cells. Anoikis, a physiologically essential function, prevents detached cells from forming dysplastic colonies at places other than their correct anatomical locations, and ensures tissue homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].

To test whether HCT-8 R cells have acquired anoikis resistance, we performed cell suspension growth assays for both R and E cells. PA gels without any ECM coating were used to culture both cell types for 8&#x000a0;days followed by cell viability measurements. Since ECM-free gel surfaces are inert and non-adhesive, cells do not form any specific or non-specific anchorage and are thus kept in suspension. The anchorage-free growth and viability of cells on gels were confirmed by daily imaging.</p><p>After 7&#x000a0;days culture in suspension, 95.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.07% of single HCT-8 R cells were alive (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>i), and maintained cell proliferation (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>h lower panel) throughout this suspension culture period.

Soft substrate culture results in a cell population that exhibits a rounded shape, increased basement membrane invasion, anchorage-independent growth, and differential expression of genes associated with increased tumorigenicity, invasiveness, cell survival, and <italic>in vivo</italic> metastasis. In our <italic>in vivo</italic> metastatic animal model, HCT-8 R cells acquired strikingly efficient tumorigenic capacity (i.e. capacity to produce tumors in multiple organs) after injection. This mechanically-induced transition is not only limited to HCT-8 cells, as we observed the transition in other cancer cells lines as well, although the time to transition and the optimum substrate softness were dissimilar. These results, combined with our molecular data, suggest the R cells can be reasonably considered as a metastatic cell variant. Similar data were obtained by others with a rounded melanoma cell line, previously cultured on 3D soft fibrin gels, that were highly tumorigenic (tumor development with very low numbers of cells injected subcutaneously or intravenously in mice) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Our model clearly demonstrates that colon cancer R cells, produced from E cells through soft substrate culture, displayed a metastatic phenotype that was not linked to cell survival or mitotic rate of neoplastic cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results raise the possibility that cells from different origins may undergo an accelerated metastatic transition dependent on their respective optimum mechanical microenvironmental niche.</p><p>Our RNA-seq and protein expression analysis showed that a soft mechanical microenvironment stimulated HCT-8 cells to express a number of metastasis-enhancing genes associated with functions such as apoptosis inhibition, motility, metastatic activity and cancer stem cell traits. Among those, ALDH3A1, CLDN2 and TNS4 (CTEN), were found consistently up-regulated in R cells, are of particular interest.</p><p>Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) are cytosolic enzymes responsible for oxidizing aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes to carboxylic acids.

The analysis of mRNA and protein expression using a total of 309 patient samples revealed that CLDN2 expression is significantly increased in colorectal cancer, and correlates with cancer progression and tissue invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. It has also been reported that colon cancer tumors with higher CTEN mRNA expression display a poorer histological grade, deeper serosa invasion, and more positive lymph node metastasis or peritoneal dissemination. Multivariate analysis also revealed high CTEN mRNA expression could serve as poor prognostic predictor for colon cancer staging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>It is rather surprising to discover that HCT-8 R cells harvested following weeks of culture on soft substrates show <italic>in vitro</italic> irreversibility of their rounded morphology and altered expression of proteins such as E-Cadherin and actin cytoskeleton filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This interesting phenomenon raises another question: Is it a transition or selection process promoted by soft substrates? Instead of initiating E-R transition <italic>de novo</italic>, it is possible that soft substrates might enhance the selection of a pre-existing R cell population that possesses the rounded morphology and invasive characteristics seen in our results. The results of RNAseq analyses, qPCR, and enzyme activity studies consistently show that R cells express the cancer stem cell marker ALDH3A1. Recently it was reported that an appropriately soft fibrin gel microenvironment selects a metastatic variant of murine B16-F1 melanoma cells that possess the traits of cancer stem cells and are highly tumorigenic in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. During culture of HCT-8 E cells in standard tissue culture flasks, we and other independent groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] also showed that a few rounded isolated cells (R-like cells) appeared only on top of confluent epithelial monolayer (E cells). Although future work is needed to investigate the similarity between pre-existing R cells and R cells produced by E-R transition and dissociation from E-cell islands on soft gels, we cannot rule out the intriguing possibility that soft substrates might enhance the selection and proliferation of a pre-existing stem-like R cell population. Stem-like R cells, instead of epithelial-like E cells, might have preferred proliferation on the mechanically soft microenvironment. This hypothesis; however, appears to somewhat contradict our experimental observations showing that only R cells were present on soft PA gels after 2&#x02013;3 weeks of culture, while there were nearly no E cells remaining. It seems unlikely that a selection process would result in almost complete elimination of the E cell population. Furthermore, the morphological appearance of R-cell generation from the edge of E-cell islands (26) appears more consistent with a conversion (E-R transition) than a selection process. Nevertheless, it is quite possible that both a selection and a transition processes might co-exist.</p><p>The underlying mechanism by which cancer cells sense the microenvironment and decide their metastatic fate remains elusive, but inter- and intracellular forces are likely to play critical roles. The metastatic transition we have demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> immediately enables us to explore the physical-molecular mechanisms of the tumor microenvironment that may initiate the metastatic journey of cancer cells by turning on the necessary molecular pathways. Understanding these mechanisms may lead to the engineering of novel therapeutic drugs capable of inhibiting the initiation of metastasis, for example by blocking the downstream molecular pathways up regulated by the changing tumor mechanical microenvironment. Furthermore, new molecular biomarkers may be developed for rapid, earlier detection and monitoring of metastatic activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our comprehensive, comparative investigation reveals HCT-8 R cells are remarkably more invasive and tumorigenic compared to E cells. The R cells express many of the molecular signatures associated with resistance to hypoxia, apoptosis, as well as genes linked to metastasis and poor clinical outcome in colon cancer patients. This E-R transition, accelerated by <italic>in vitro</italic> mechanical cues, may mimic the early stages of metastasis, which are difficult to study <italic>in vivo</italic>. The study presented here suggests mechanical forces within the tumor microenvironment may play a pivotal role in early metastatic transition, and such mechanical environments can be mimicked in an <italic>in vitro</italic> model. Such <italic>in vitro</italic> models may enable us to identify the early cellular, mechanical, biophysical, molecular and genetic events responsible for initiation of cancer metastasis, assess the relative metastatic potential of cells obtained from patient biospecimens, identify molecular markers for early diagnosis, and to screen putative therapeutics for inhibition of metastasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human colon adenocarcinoma HCT-8 cells (Cat.

The PA gels are made with varied relative concentrations of acrylamide (Bio-Rad) and N, N&#x02019;- methylene bis-acrylamide (Bio-Rad Inc.) to obtain different cross-link percentages resulting in different elastic moduli. For 20 kPa PA gels, the mol/v concentrations of acrylamide and N, N&#x02019;- methylene bis-acrylamide are 8% and 0.13%, respectively.

During harvesting, the R cells from PA gels were flushed from the gel surface using sterile culture media and filtered using a sterile 40&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m&#x000a0;mesh filter (BD Falcon #352340) to remove primarily residual E cell clusters. E cells and R cells (following expansion on PS for 7 additional days) were harvested with trypsin EDTA and all cell populations adjusted to the same starting concentration (7&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;106 cells per ml)]. Aliquots (0.3&#x000a0;ml) of the starting R or E cell concentrations were applied to the upper compartment of a CytoSelect&#x02122; Cell Invasion chamber (Cat #: CBA 110, Cell Biolabs). Following 48&#x000a0;hours of culture in the assay chambers invasive cells are able to degrade the matrix proteins in the layer, pass through the pores of the polycarbonate membrane, and adhere to the bottom ECM membrane insert. Non-invasive cells were removed from the upper chamber and invasive cells exposed on the bottom of the ECM membrane were stained according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions and quantified by a light microscope using Metamorph imaging software.</p></sec><sec><title>Whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-Seq) and pathway analysis</title><p>Whole Transcriptome Sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis was carried out for RNA derived from cells cultured on soft PA gel and hard polystyrene (PS) substrates. Harvested cells were put in RNA protect reagents (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) to preserve the integrity of RNA. Total RNA samples were isolated from E and R HCT-8 cells using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendation. Briefly, confluent E cells at passage 18 (approximately 3-4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells per P60 polystyrene dish) following 3 or 17&#x000a0;days of culture were rinsed with PBS followed by scraping off the cell layer in 750&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of RNA Protect. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation. Cell pellets were suspended in 350 ul of RLT buffer from the RNeasy kit and were homogenized using the Qiashredder spin column. The homogenized cell lysate effluent from the Qiashredder spin column was then processed as per RNeasy mini kit manufacturer&#x02019;s directions, which included a gDNA eliminator column and total RNA was obtained in water. Likewise, total RNA from E cells grown on 20 kPA polyacrylamide gels for 3&#x000a0;days was obtained. Total RNA from R cells was harvested following growth on 20 kPA polyacrylamide gels for 15&#x000a0;days followed by filtering through 40&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m&#x000a0;mesh (BD Falcon #352340) and expanded by culture on PS for 4&#x000a0;days. Concentrations and initial quality assessment of the RNA were determined by measuring absorbance at 260, 230 and 280&#x000a0;nm. RNA quality of the samples was checked using Nano6000/Pico bioanalyzer chips (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, Santa Clara, CA) at the Keck Center for Comparative and Functional Genomics, University of Illinois. These RNA samples are denoted as PS3 (culture on polystyrene for 3&#x000a0;days), PS17 (culture on polystyrene for 17&#x000a0;days), Gel3 (culture on polyacrylamide for 3&#x000a0;days), and R (cells harvested after 15&#x000a0;days of culture on 20 kPA gels and expanded on PS for 4&#x000a0;days).</p><p>Following RNA isolation an additional DNase1 digestion step was performed to ensure that the samples are free from any contaminated with genomic DNA. Libraries are prepared using TruSeq RNA Sample Prep kits (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA) and sequencing is performed at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia, using an Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer. Sequence run was then set up for 100, 7, and 100&#x000a0;cycles for Read1, Index Read and Read2, respectively on HiSeq2000 using TruSeq SBS V3.0 kit. Off Line Base (OLB) calling, demultiplexing and FastQ files were then generated using CASAVA 1.8.2 (Illumina Inc. San Diego, CA, USA).</p><p>E and R cell RNA-Seq reads are trimmed to remove poor quality sequences in Roy J. Carver Biotechnology Center, UIUC. Sequence files are mapped against the Human Genome (hg19) using TopHat tool such that only uniquely mapped reads are reported and used for further data analysis. Splice junctions are automatically determined by TopHat, with the provided guidance of annotated gene models (GTF file) obtained mainly from Ensembl. In this analysis, all three splice sites, &#x0201c;GT-AG&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;GC-AG&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;AT-AC&#x0201d; will be considered. All splicing junctions supported by at least one high-quality mapped read will be kept. The resulting alignment data from Tophat are then fed to an assembler, Cufflinks, to assemble aligned RNA-Seq reads into parsimonious set of transcripts and to estimate their abundances and test for differential expression and regulation in RNA-Seq samples. Cufflinks is used to address the common issue of read alignment to multiple isoforms of the same gene or multiple transcripts within the same genetic locus in the assembly by performing maximum likelihood estimation based on a numerical optimization algorithm for calculating FPKM. Cufflinks is executed for each sample separately using their alignment file (.BAM file) and hg19 annotation file (.gtf file), which results in a &#x02018;transcripts.gtf&#x02019; files for each sample. Cuffcompare tool from Cufflinks package is used to track the cufflinks transcripts (transcripts.gtf) across multiple experiments and compare the assembled transcripts across all samples to the reference annotation file (.gtf file) and to give a combined (.gtf) file. Cuffdiff tool from Cufflinks package will be used to find significant changes in gene expression. This tool is executed using alignment files of two samples being compared and using combined .gtf files generated from previous cuffcompare tool. Transcript abundances are measured in Fragments Per Kilobase of exon per Million fragments mapped (FPKM), which originate from RPKM (Reads per Kilobase per Million). Student&#x02019;s t-test was then used to find significantly differentially expressed transcripts, with the test statistic (fold expression) derived from the log ratio of FPKM values when comparing two samples. In an attempt to bias the results to screen for gene expression changes primarily resulting from the transition from an E to R cell induced by a change in substrate mechanical stiffness rather than variance in general cell culture conditions, genes were scored as differentially expressed only if they were seen simultaneously in three different comparisons (R vs PS3, R vs Gel3 and R vs PS17). These three comparisons represent comparing cells that have undergone E to R transition (R cells) with E cells that were exposed to either polystyrene (hard) or polyacrylamide gels (soft) substrates for varying culture times but that did not undergo E to R transition. Preliminary pathway analysis was carried out using the online Panther software with focus on the genes with differential expression comparison levels lower than q-value of 0.05 and according to the criteria mentioned above.</p></sec><sec><title>RT-qPCR</title><p>First strand c-DNA was synthesized from total RNA using Superscript III catalog # 18080&#x02013;051 (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) according to manufacturer&#x02019;s direction.
