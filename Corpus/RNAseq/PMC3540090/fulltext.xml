In fish, skeletal muscle may represent approximately half of their body mass and provides the engine for swimming, an intrinsic and characteristic behaviour of this group of vertebrates. From a functional point of view, two types of skeletal muscle can be identified in fish: white skeletal muscle, which is anaerobic and fuels burst swimming, and red skeletal muscle, which is aerobic and fuels sustained swimming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Videler1">[1]</xref>. For many fish species, their life history is intimately linked to their ability to perform under swimming-induced exercise conditions that, in turn, is dependent on the functionality of skeletal muscle.</p><p>Among migrant fish species, the most extreme exercise conditions are experienced during the anorexic reproductive migration, as performed by salmonid species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Ueda1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Miller1">[3]</xref>. Fish that migrate long distances to reach their spawning grounds like salmonids face two major challenges before they can successfully reproduce: to swim and to sexually mature. Recently, we applied exercise experimentally to investigate its effects on sexual maturation in female rainbow trout <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Palstra1">[4]</xref>. The main conclusion of that study was that swimming suppresses ovarian development at the start of vitellogenesis. Swimming requires streamlining of the body and muscle building for optimal performance. However, the progression of oocyte growth (e.g. vitellogenesis) may cause a change in body shape that, in turn, could increase drag resistance, and may also lead to muscle atrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Salem1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Salem2">[6]</xref>, leading to decreased swimming efficiency. Therefore, long distance migrants need to up-regulate the energetic processes in the muscle that provide fuel for contraction and for muscle growth, and to suppress vitellogenesis: the migration phenotype. When there is a need to start vitellogenesis, the situation in the muscle and the ovary is reversed: the sexual maturation phenotype.</p><p>Despite the important role of skeletal muscle for swimming in fish, relatively little is known regarding the molecular events that take place in red and white skeletal muscle in response to swimming-induced activity. In this study, we have used deep RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), a high-throughput transcriptomic approach, to provide an in-depth view of the transcriptome of red and white skeletal muscle in rainbow trout. To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the first application of RNA-seq to the study of the skeletal muscle transcriptome in rainbow trout. We have chosen to use rainbow trout because it is an economically important species for aquaculture and because it displays (facultative) migrant behaviour. Still, in absence of a reference genome of rainbow trout, the nucleotide transcripts (&#x02018;reads&#x02019;) need to be <italic>de novo</italic> assembled to larger groups of sequences representing overlapping regions from the transcriptome (&#x02018;contigs&#x02019;). Contigs can then be annotated using iterative sequence homology searches against known related sequences such as salmonid ESTs or the zebrafish genome. In the present study, we used RNA-seq to catalogue the red and white muscle transcriptome in rainbow trout. We also aimed to investigate the effects of exercise in red and white muscle and, specifically, to focus on muscle building versus muscle wasting processes and on the potential interaction between skeletal muscle and the reproductive axis. The gained information should allow us to determine whether the rainbow trout muscle matched the migration phenotype or the sexual maturation phenotype after the long-term exercise of simulated reproductive migration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The Experimental Set-up</title><p>The swimming experiment was performed in a 6,000 L swim-flume recently described in Palstra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Palstra1">[4]</xref>. In short, an oval shaped swim-flume (6.0&#x000d7;4.0&#x000d7;0.8 m) had been placed in a 100 m<sup>2</sup> climatized room. In one of the straight ends of the swim-flume, a compartment of 2.0&#x000d7;0.7 m was created with two mesh fences (5 cm mesh size). This compartment was divided by a PVC fence that started in the curve. The resulting inner compartment, where the current was null, was used to house the resting group. The outer compartment where the current was maximal was used to house the swimming group. Thus, both groups were subjected to identical conditions except for swimming exercise. Initially, water in the swim-flume was brackish at 10 &#x02030;, created by mixing natural seawater from the Oosterschelde at the Burgersluis as delivered by truck (Van Vugt, Zuilinchem, the Netherlands), with tap water. Flow was created and speed profiles were measured as described before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Palstra1">[4]</xref> as well as water temperature and water quality parameters that were monitored and controlled.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Ethics</title><p>The swimming experiments as described have been approved by the animal welfare committee (DEC) of Leiden University under number 08107.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Experimental Fish and Conditions</title><p>In order to simulate the natural reproductive conditions of anadromous salmonids, experiments were performed with sea water-raised rainbow trout. Resters and swimmers were unfed during the experiment, seawater was replaced by fresh water and photoperiod was changed as described below. Because both resters and swimmers were experiencing these conditions at the same time in the same set-up, any additional effects in swimming fish would be expected to be caused by swimming only.</p><p>Pubertal autumn spawning female rainbow trout (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;20; &#x0223c;50 cm, &#x0223c;1.8 kg) were purchased from a Danish exporter (Frederiksvaerk Aleexport, Frederiksvaerk, Denmark) where they had been raised for 2 years in freshwater followed by 4 months in sea water cages at 10 &#x02030;. They were transferred by truck within 16 h directly to the swim-flume at Leiden University (The Netherlands). Fish were randomly divided into a &#x02018;rest&#x02019;-group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10) and a &#x02018;swim&#x02019;-group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10). During the following 4 days, the brackish 10 &#x02030; water was stepwise replaced by freshwater at 16&#x000b0;C and photoperiod was changed from 16L:8D to 8L:16D. Fish were then acclimatized for two days to their new conditions. As in our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Palstra1">[4]</xref>, swimmers were first swum at a speed of 0.33 body-lengths per second (BL/s) that was increased the next day to the final, near optimal speed of 0.75 BL/s (0.34 m/s or 29.4 km/day) and all fish were sampled after 40 days. Fish did not show any signs of fatigue, stress or health problems during 40 days of resting or swimming without feeding. After 40 days, a distance of 1,176 km had been swum continuously in a sustained manner. At sampling, fish were anesthetized using oil of cloves (diluted 1&#x02236;10 in ethanol and used at a dosage of 1.5 ml/l), euthanized by decapitation and dissected for red and white muscle tissue from standardized locations. Samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and Q-PCR. In addition, the gonadosomatic index (GSI) was measured from trout at the beginning of the experiment (day 0) and at the termination of the experiment (day 40). Our results show that the GSI of resters at the termination of the 40-day experimental period (GSI&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5.47&#x000b1;0.25%) was significantly higher than that of fish at the beginning of the experimental period (day 0; GSI&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.58&#x000b1;0.07%), indicating that ovarian development was stimulated by the reproductive conditions. However, no significant differences in FSI were observed between resters and swimmers at the termination of the 40-day experimental period (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>RNA Isolation, Library Preparation and Sequencing</title><p>Equal parts from each of the ten individual tissue samples per group (red muscle from swimmers, white muscle from swimmers, red muscle from resters, white muscle from resters) were pooled in QIAzol Lysis Reagent (Qiagen Benelux BV, Venlo, The Netherlands). A Qiagen TissueRuptor (Qiagen Benelux BV, Venlo, The Netherlands) was used to cut up the tissue samples and RNA was extracted from each of these pools using the Qiagen miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Benelux BV, Venlo, The Netherlands) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s description.

For each sample a RNA-seq library was prepared with an Illumina mRNA-Seq Sample Preparation Kit according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s description (Illumina HQ, San Diego CA, USA) and cluster generation was performed. For each library, a single read of 51 nucleotides was performed with each sample group on one lane of a flowcell. The flowcell was run on an Illumina GAIIx sequencer. Image analysis and base calling were done by the Illumina pipeline (Illumina HQ, San Diego CA, USA). The Illumina GA IIx uses the clonally amplified template method resulting in a population of identical templates coupled with the four-colour cyclic reversible termination (CRT) method to compromise nucleotide incorporation, fluorescence imaging and cleavage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Metzker1">[7]</xref>.

Reads were aligned to the contigs (allowing 1 mismatch and up to 10 alignments per read) and summarized as Reads Per Kilobase (exon model) per Million mapped reads (RPKM) normalized expression values (aligned read count normalized for contig length and total number of aligned reads; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Mortazavi1">[8]</xref>). For differential expression between swimmers and resters of each contig, the RPKM value of the swimmers was divided by that of the resters.

The Ct values were normalized for each gene against those obtained for the housekeeping gene <italic>rps18</italic>. Normalized Ct values were expressed as fc using the relative quantification method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Livak1">[12]</xref>, calculated for swimmers relative to resters. Fold changes on the basis of RPKM values and those determined by Q-PCR were compared for direction (up or down-regulated) and degree of expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Gene Ontology (GO) Analysis</title><p>For each tissue, Blast2GO was used to create DAT files containing: 1) the best BLAST hits from the filtered BLASTn vs. salmonid SIGENAE database but with accession numbers changed from SIGENAE to their best BLAST hit protein id (ProtID) in order to be able to retrieve GeneOntology terms; 2) the best BLAST hits from the filtered BLASTx <italic>vs.</italic> the <italic>D. rerio</italic> refSeq database and 3) the best BLAST hits and non-annotated sequences from the BLASTx vs. refSeq Metazoa Proteins database excluding <italic>D. rerio</italic>. These files were used to perform GO analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Conesa1">[10]</xref> on the whole transcriptome of red and white muscle. Specifically, both tissues were compared on biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components. A similar approach was followed in the identification of biological processes and molecular functions that were characterised by the involvement of differentially expressed contigs larger than 500 nt.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>Two approaches were followed in this study. First, a comparison was made between the whole red and white muscle transcriptome for all contigs or only the large contigs. We used the package Gossip <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Blthgen1">[13]</xref> for statistical assessment of annotation differences between both sets as integrated within Blast2GO. We tested differences between red and white muscle transcriptome using a two-tailed Fisher&#x02019;s Exact Test that corrects for multiple testing providing a corrected p-value by False Discovery Rate (FDR) control. Red muscle was tested vs. white muscle as reference. Differences with FDR &#x02264;0.05 were considered significant. Secondly, for quantifying the effects of exercise using RNA-seq, we pooled tissue samples of 10 fish per group as biological replicates. Statistical assessment of differences between the single values of the treatment groups was not possible but a generally accepted biologically meaningful cut-off level of fold change 2 was applied. The incorporation of biological replicates was at this stage of pioneering with RNA-seq applications for fish research still not affordable.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>RNA Sequencing (RNA-seq)</title><p>RNA-seq yielded 15.1 million (M) reads for white muscle in resters and 16.6 M reads in swimmers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053171-t001">Table 1</xref>).

Skeletal Muscle in Response to Exercise</title><p>Among all contigs in red muscle, 10.0% were down-regulated at fc &#x02264;0.5 and 14.2% were up-regulated at fc &#x02265;2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053171-t002">Table 2</xref>) in swimmers. Similar values were obtained in white muscle of swimmers, with 12.6% of the contigs down-regulated at fc &#x02264;0.5 and 10.3% up-regulated at fc &#x02265;2. In red muscle, 1,366 contigs appeared in swimmers only and thus indicated exercise specific transcripts, while 1,503 contigs appeared in resters only (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053171-t002">Table 2</xref>). In white muscle, 1,361 contigs appeared in swimmers only and 1,185 contigs appeared in resters only. However, all of these contigs that were specific for swimmers or resters were small (&#x02264;300 nt) except for the mentioned interferon-induced very large GTPase 1-like contig of 418 nt with a RPKM value of 20.2 that was only found in the white muscle of resters. Because RPKM values are determined on basis of 1000 nt, decreases in contig size are associated with increased noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053171-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), which can be defined as the occurrence of false differentially expressed contigs due to their small size. Because of this, contig size thresholds need to be applied for justifying the quantification of expression. In the present study, although abundance was positively correlated to size, as also reported by Hegedus et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Hegeds1">[14]</xref>, we have applied a size threshold of &#x02265;500 nt since this size group was virtually without noise as visualized by MA plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053171-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Contigs that were smaller than 500 nt showed increasing false differential expression noise with smaller size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053171-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The larger contigs (&#x02265;500 nt) showed less noise in differential expression as determined by RPKM. In red muscle, the expression of 118 large contigs was down-regulated at fc &#x02264;0.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053171.s007">Table S3</xref>) and 51 were up-regulated at fc &#x02265;2 in swimmers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053171.s008">Table S4</xref>). In the white muscle of swimmers, the expression of 71 large contigs was down-regulated at fc &#x02264;0.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053171.s009">Table S5</xref>) and 29 were up-regulated at fc &#x02265;2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053171.s010">Table S6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Differentially Expressed Genes Common in Red and White Muscle</title><p>Red and white muscle shared only seven contigs that were differentially expressed in response to exercise on the basis of RPKM values.

In total, we have identified 1,432 novel rainbow trout sequences but among these, however, there were many hypothetical, probable and predicted protein sequences. When these unannotated sequences were filtered out of the results, 731 novel rainbow trout annotated sequences remained.

In addition, components of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) family were identified, including the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor or IGF-2 receptor, known to transduce the myogenic differentiation-promoting effects of IGF-2 in muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Wilson1">[29]</xref>, and several IGF binding proteins (IGFBP3, 5 and 6b) that regulate the biological activity of IGF-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Duan1">[30]</xref>. Interestingly, there is also evidence for a possible role of androgens in trout skeletal muscle function as inferred from the identification of the androgen receptor (AR) as well as from genes that increase AR expression, such as supervillin, a cytoskeletal protein that is also a myogenic regulator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Ting1">[31]</xref>, and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Klover1">[32]</xref>. Another member of the STAT family identified in our study is STAT2, known to promote myogenic differentiation by increasing the expression of myogenic factors and IGF-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Wang1">[33]</xref>. Apart from a number of novel structural and cytoskeletal elements (e.g. myosins, troponins and alpha-actinins), cell adhesion and extracellular matrix components (e.g. laminin, integrin and collagens) and ion channels (voltage-dependent calcium, sodium and potassium channels), we have identified ryanodine and acetylcholine receptors, known to be involved in the neural regulation of muscle activity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Mu1">[16]</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Gundersen1">[24]</xref>), and two forms of ankyrin (ankyrin 1 or ankyrin-R and ankyrin 3 or ankyrin-G) that play key roles in the assembly and functioning of membrane domains in skeletal muscle fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Hopitzan1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Ayalon1">[35]</xref>. Not surprisingly, several key metabolic regulators were also identified in trout skeletal muscle, including genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism (glycogen phosphorylase, glycogenin, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, phosphorylase b kinase regulatory subunit alpha, etc.), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) alpha-2, a well-known &#x0201c;fuel gauge&#x0201d; that transduces the effects of exercise-induced muscle contraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Hardie1">[36]</xref>, protein kinase C theta and, importantly, mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2, a known regulator of energy metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Brand1">[37]</xref> that is known to be up-regulated in response to contractile activity in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Petersen1">[38]</xref>. Finally, we identified a large set of genes involved in the regulation of protein degradation, mostly belonging to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, but also calpain proteases 1 and 3, with known roles in myofibrillar protein turnover (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Goll1">[39]</xref>), and NF-&#x003ba;B p100 subunit and NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor epsilon, two signalling molecules acting downstream of the action of tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; or TNF&#x003b1;), a pro-inflammatory cytokine that contributes to muscle atrophy in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Jackman1">[40]</xref>. Although just a few of the novel genes reported here have been identified in other teleost species, the identified genes and the pathways in which they participate are expected to play an important role in skeletal muscle function in teleost fish (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Johnston1">[41]</xref>). In support of this idea, AMPK has recently been shown by our group to stimulate glucose uptake through a GLUT4-mediated mechanism and to increase the mRNA levels of genes involved in glucose metabolism (including 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase) in trout muscle cells in primary culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Magnoni1">[42]</xref>. Furthermore, we have also recently shown that NF-&#x003ba;B is an important intracellular signalling molecule mediating the stimulatory effects of TNF&#x003b1; on glucose uptake in muscle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Vraskou1">[43]</xref>.</p><p>In teleost fish, red and white skeletal muscle types are believed to play different but complementary roles during swimming. Whereas red muscle mainly powers sustained swimming, white muscle is involved mostly in burst swimming or sprinting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Videler1">[1]</xref>. Under the conditions of the present study, fish swam at near their optimal swimming speed and, therefore, a higher implication of the red muscle in swimming was expected. Our results suggest that red and white muscle of rainbow trout may differ in terms of their transcriptomic characteristics. First, the red muscle transcriptome appeared to be slightly larger than the white muscle transcriptome in terms of the number of reads (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053171-t001">Table 1</xref>) and contigs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053171-t002">Table 2</xref>), although these small differences were not assessed statistically. Second, all differential GO terms between the two muscle transcriptomes, when considering only the large contigs (&#x02265;500 nt), appeared to score higher in number of sequences for red muscle than for white muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053171-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) and reflected the biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components involved in muscle contraction. Furthermore, large contigs associated with biological processes were more abundant in red muscle than in white muscle. Significant white muscle contribution to exercise is suggested, however, by the observations that the white muscle transcriptome of swimmers appeared to be 10% larger in terms of number of reads than that of resters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053171-t001">Table 1</xref>) and that the red muscle transcriptome was smaller in swimmers than in resters. Further support for the transcriptomic differences between red and white skeletal muscle in rainbow trout comes from our observation that genes involved in the response to anabolic androgens (AR and STAT5) and in protein degradation (NF-&#x003ba;B and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways, proteolytic enzymes) were almost exclusively expressed in white skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053171-t003">Table 3</xref>), in which the interplay between protein synthesis and degradation appears to be more relevant. Furthermore, troponin T3b (fast isoform 1) and troponin C, two key regulators of skeletal muscle contraction, were only up-regulated in white muscle of swimmers, as confirmed by Q-PCR. On the other hand, all three slow troponins identified in this study (troponin I, troponin T1 and Troponin T2a) were expressed only in red muscle, in accordance with the particular biochemical and contractile characteristics of this type of muscle. Interestingly, <italic>fhl1</italic>, a gene known to promote hypertrophy in skeletal muscle in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Cowling1">[44]</xref>, was clearly up-regulated in white muscle of swimmers, as confirmed by Q-PCR. Specific for the red muscle, however, was the up-regulation of <italic>ncoa4</italic>, a gene believed to be involved in muscle hypertrophy through its stimulation of protein synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Siriett1">[45]</xref>. It is worth mentioning that MYH7b, a gene that in mammals encodes the intronic miR-499, was found to be up-regulated in the red muscle of swimmers. In mammals, expression of miR-499 drives the conversion of fast myofibers to slow, type I myofibers in skeletal muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-vanRooij1">[46]</xref> and, in view of this, it is tempting to speculate that swimming-induced contraction in trout may have increased the aerobic capacity of red skeletal muscle. Overall, our results show that muscle developmental processes appeared to be up-regulated in white muscle, but in red muscle the expression of genes involved in muscle development was either up-regulated or down-regulated. These results suggest that the anorexic swimming performance of simulated reproductive migration in rainbow trout may contribute to muscle growth and development, at least for the white muscle, supporting a role for this tissue in sustained swimming, and, thus, provide molecular support to the known stimulation of muscle fiber hypertrophy by swimming-induced activity in fish (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Palstra2">[47]</xref>). Further studies investigating the relationship between swimming-induced changes in the skeletal muscle transcriptome and the morphometric characteristics of muscle fibres will be necessary to understand the molecular basis of the growth-potentiating effects of swimming in fish.</p><p>Our results on the validation by qPCR of differentially expressed contigs by RNAseq in white and red skeletal muscle of exercised fish showed a 70% agreement with the two methods. However, the remaining contigs did not show the same direction in expression difference in response to exercise when the two methods were compared. We attribute these differences in gene expression changes between RNAseq and qPCR, first and most importantly, to the fact that contigs were generated by <italic>de novo</italic> assembly and not by use of a reference genome, since the trout genome is not available yet, and, second, to the differences in dynamic range between these two methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Mortazavi1">[8]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>The Migration Phenotype: Muscle Development and Steroid Binding of the Muscle</title><p>In this study, we have mimicked the conditions experienced by trout during reproductive migration with the specific aim to provide insight into the relationship between migration and sexual maturation, two seemingly competing processes representing a state of muscle building versus a state of muscle wasting, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Palstra1">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Salem2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Palstra3">[48]</xref>. In this regard, we hypothesize that sex steroids, and particularly androgens, may play a key role in exercise-enhanced muscle building. Support for this hypothesis may come from our observations that AR and STAT5, a regulator in turn of the expression of AR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Klover1">[32]</xref>, are expressed exclusively in white muscle and that <italic>ncoa4</italic>, believed to exert its hypertrophic action by interacting with AR and enhancing its activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Siriett1">[45]</xref>, is up-regulated in red muscle of swimmers. Interestingly, the hypertrophy-promoting gene <italic>fhl1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Cowling1">[44]</xref>, up-regulated in white muscle of swimmers, is known to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of estrogen signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Lin1">[49]</xref> and its transcription in mammalian skeletal muscle cells is inhibited by estrogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Wang2">[50]</xref>. This suggests that, in contrast to androgen-response mechanisms, estrogen-responsive mechanisms may not be active in white muscle of exercised rainbow trout. In support for the notion that androgens could be involved in the acquisition of the migration phenotype and that estrogens may antagonize it, a recent study has shown that testosterone may exert growth-promoting effects due to its ability to directly sensitize the white muscle to the effects of growth hormone (GH) and IGF-1 whereas 17&#x003b2;-estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) attenuates the growth-promoting effects of GH and IGF-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053171-Norbeck1">[51]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>The Sexual Maturation Phenotype: Interaction of Skeletal Muscle with the Reproductive Axis</title><p>Several clues regarding the interaction between skeletal muscle and the reproductive axis may provide more insight into the progression of the sexual maturation phenotype.

Although it is not known if <italic>vtg</italic> expression in trout skeletal muscle can be regulated by E<sub>2</sub>, we hypothesize that the down-regulation of <italic>vtg</italic> expression in white muscle of swimmers could be related to a possible down-regulation of estrogen-responsiveness that could characterize the migration phenotype, as stated above. In fact, several small contigs for estrogen receptor beta were found in white and red muscle of trout although without apparent differences in expression between resters and swimmers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053171.s012">Table S8</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, in white muscle a small contig was annotated as the <italic>kiss1 receptor</italic> (<italic>kiss1r</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053171.s012">Table S8</xref>) and we hypothesize that it may play a role in receiving maturity signals by circulating kisspeptin.

White muscle shows up-regulated muscle developmental processes and increased activity in swimmers. Furthermore, indirect evidence suggests that gonadal steroids may play an important regulatory role in the development of the migration phenotype, as characterized by aerobic muscle contraction.
